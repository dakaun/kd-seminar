{"Samsung": {"2016-02-19": ["Ingram Micro, the world's largest distributor of technology, entered into a merger agreement earlier this week with Tianjin Tianhai Investment Company, Ltd. The Hainan-based global conglomerate will acquire Ingram for $38.90 per share, with an overall value of around $6 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, barring all stockholder and regulatory approvals.\n\nWhile Tianjin Tianhai ultimately rolls up into the larger HNA Group, Ingram Micro operations are expected to continue running without any major disruption or changes. Ultimately, Ingram Micro will remain headquartered in Irvine, CA with the current executive staff continuing to preside over the distribution business.\n\nHNA Group as a whole has many investments and sectors to their business including transportation, logistics, financial services, and tourism. The acquisition of such a large distribution business adds to HNA's $90 billion in assets and specifically to their logistics portfolio as Ingram Micro delivers supply chain solutions and services. Ingram's broad global presence, especially in emerging markets, was also likely a draw for the Chinese company.\n\nIngram Micro stock has been directly affected as well from the merger with stocks growing over 20 percent after the announcement of the acquisition. The news in general caught the distribution channel by surprise with many shocked to hear the news. Ingram's reach is obvious broad with manufacturer partners that include Cisco, HP, IBM, Apple, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Samsung.\n\nIngram Micro's CEO, Alain Moni\u00e9 said of the merger, \"Our agreement to join HNA Group delivers near-term and compelling cash value to our stockholders and we expect it to provide exciting new opportunities for our vendors, customers and associates. Innovation, new services introduction, brand management and ensuring the stability and continuity of the businesses joining their enterprise are fundamental to HNA Group's overall strategy. As a part of HNA Group, we will have the ability to accelerate strategic investment, as we continue to capitalize on the constant evolution of technology and emerging trends by adding expertise, capabilities and geographic reach. Additionally, Ingram Micro will now be part of a larger organization that has complementary logistics capabilities and a strong presence in China that can further support the growth and profitability objectives of our vendor and customer partners.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this purchase impacts the IT supply chain later this year and into 2017. As was earlier stated, there should be no change to how Ingram operates, but this could at the very least provide some additional flexibility and agility to the distribution giant.", "We are on the eve of MWC, where Samsung and LG will take the stage to unveil their respective flagship devices. Leading up to this Sunday, we have seen a ton of leaks on the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, LG G5, and even the One M10 from HTC. It's been a crazy week, to say the least.\n\nBeyond device leaks, Apple stood up against the FBI, Motorola announced it will not send out Lollipop updates for the DROID Ultra, Maxx and Mini, Nextbit's Robin was made available for purchase, and we took a stroll down memory lane with a hands-on video of Android 2.2 running on the \"OG\" DROID. Good times, indeed.\n\nIf you missed any of it, all of the biggest Android stories are linked below.\n\nWe'll catch you on Sunday for all of the MWC excitement, folks.", "Tim Cook's condemnation of a federal court order compelling Apple to write custom software that can bypass its own security restrictions has royally honked off the Department of Justice, which filed a motion today to compel Apple's immediate cooperation in the case. Apple had previously asked for (and been granted) an additional three days to consider its response, which is now due by February 26.\n\nThe Department of Justice's new filing pulls absolutely no punches, as shown below.\n\nBased on Apple's public statement and other statements by Apple, Apple's current refusal to comply with the Court's Order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy..\n\nApple's public statement make it clear that Apple will not comply with the Court's Order. The government does not seek to deny Apple's its right to be heard, and expects these issues to be fully briefed before the Court; however, the urgency of this investigation requires this motion now that Apple has made its intention not to comply patently clear.\n\nIn other words: Because Apple will appeal the district court ruling and almost certainly ask that ruling to be suspended pending litigation, the DOJ wants to force Apple to comply immediately and settle the question at a later date.\n\nApple can challenge the All Writs Act used to compel its testimony in several ways but will almost certainly rest its case by arguing that the support the government wants is not, in fact, a minor issue. The DOJ and FBI have argued that it's basically trivial for Apple to create a system that would unlock just one device while bypassing the security protections meant to secure the product from tampering. Apple has argued that creating such software is burdensome, and pointed out that while it has cooperated with the government in the past, it did so with devices running iOS 7 or below. Beginning with iOS 8, Apple began fully encrypting the product.\n\nEarlier today, Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple products until the company turns over the information on the San Bernardino devices. What's somewhat more amusing is that Donald Trump's campaign manager was sending out tweets on an iPhone at exactly the same time.\n\nKudos to 9to5Mac for the catch on this one. Trump later sent the following tweet, \"clarifying\" the situation and vowing to only use Samsung devices from this point forward.\n\nUnconfirmed rumors from ExtremeTech's armada of Korean spies suggest that Trump and Samsung are actually collaborating on a future Galaxy device that will channel Trump's restraint and thoughtful demeanor with Samsung's beloved TouchWiz UI.", "Donald Trump on Friday called for a boycott against Apple until the technology giant helps the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\n\"Boycott Apple until such time as they give that information,\" Trump told a crowded room of supporters during a town hall-style event here just one day before the South Carolina GOP primary.\n\n\"Apple ought to give the security for that phone, OK.

In the first six months since its release, the service has processed over $500 million dollars.\n\n\"Since its introduction last year, Samsung Pay has changed the way people pay and use their smartphones,\" said Samsung's head of research and development, software and services, and EVP of mobile communications business InJon Rhee in a statement. \"We've already seen significant consumer adoption and we continue to see great momentum. Our aim is to expand Samsung Pay to even more locations around the world, and our customers should expect to see more features in the year to come.\"\n\nAlready in the works are plans to bring Samsung Pay to more markets, including China this March, followed by Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Canada is also planned but there's no specific timeframe.\n\nThe company also revealed that it's still working on forming an extensive partnership ecosystem, growing on the 70 major and regional banks. It has partnered with credit card providers BC Card, Hana Card, KB Kookmin Card, Lotte Card, NH Nonghyup Card, and Samsung Card in South Korea to provide an online payment service in the country. In doing so, consumers can leverage the Samsung Pay Fingerprint Authentication to pay for goods and services online.\n\nOther developments include the eventual support for American Express, China UnionPay, MasterCard, and Visa, which will make it more accessible to millions of people around the world.\n\nSamsung Pay launched as an alternative payment service to take on Apple Pay in the mobile space. Rhee said at the time: \"If consumers always have to guess whether a store accepts a mobile payment it creates a mental friction. I believe in creating a basic technology that removes that friction.\"\n\nThe service operates similar to Apple Pay, allowing you to easily make payments at retail stores directly from your phone. Just swipe up on the screen, designate a card you want to use, place your finger on the scanner or enter a pin number, and that's it. It utilizes near field communication (NFC) and LoopPay's magnetic secure transmission technology.

Titles such as Chappie, Fantastic Four and The Martian have shown up at a Best Buy in Manhattan. Amazon.com still lists their copies as being available March 1, 2016, so this is a bit unexpected.\n\nThe 4K movies are selling for a marked price of $28, which is slightly lower than the 1080p Blu-ray copies which sell for $30. The Ultra HD copies include a 1080p disc as well as the 4K version disc, which has a resolution of 3840 x 2160.\n\nSamsung has also released their first Ultra HD Blu-ray player slightly early, so it is possible to enjoy the new format movies immediately. The Samsung player is the UBD-K8500, and sells for $399. You will need a television screen with 4k resolution to take full advantage of the new format, and though I expect 4K sets to become quite common in the coming years, they are still a small portion of the market at the moment.\n\nI'm interested to see if Blu-ray computer drives already in existence that work with XL discs will also play the new movies.

The S6 and S6 edge plug into the Gear VR headset and function as the headset's display and processor. For that reason, any improvements to the S7's processor, for example, could boost the platform's capabilities.\n\nMaybe more importantly, this would allow Samsung demonstrate that it is getting further ahead of Apple, which currently has no Apple-branded iPhone VR products (though Apple does sell third-party VR headsets on its store page).\n\nRelated: Samsung Galaxy S7 vs. iPhone 7 rumor roundup\n\nOther major news includes:\n\nLG: The other South Korean phone maker will show off its next-gen LG G5.

Samsung, LG, and other popular smartphone-makers use the convention as a launching pad for all their new products. Gadget fiends that we are, we can't wait.\n\nWhile there will definitely be major smartphone releases, there are also likely to be some interesting smaller announcements as well. We sifted through the heaps of rumors surrounding the show to find out exactly what will be happening this year. Here's exactly what you can expect from MWC 2016\n\nFor the last couple of years, Samsung has used MWC to build hype around its newest flagship smartphone. This year probably won't be much different. Samsung will almost definitely release a new 5.5-inch flagship smartphone dubbed the Galaxy S7. The successor to last year's flagship, the Galaxy S6, the new phone will look nearly identical to its predecessor. We expect it to have a 12-megapixel camera, 2,800mAH battery, and a micro-SD card slot. Although it's been rumored for months that the phone would include USB-C charging, the most recent leaked photos show a Galaxy S7 with a standard micro-USB charging cable. Plug right into the past.\n\nSamsung's greatest Android rival, LG, is also an MWC veteran, and this year, the company will provide details about its latest flagship, the G5. The phone is rumored to sport a brand new Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB of RAM, and a smaller battery than before. All of that basically means that the smartphone is mostly a bunch of incremental updates across the board. It will be a little thinner, a little faster, and a little zippier all around.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting rumor surrounding the LG G5 is the fact that company will introduce something called a \"Magic Slot,\" which will allow people to upgrade their smartphone using replaceable parts. The Magic Slot is intended to turn the G5 into something of a modular smartphone, meaning that people can plug in new cameras, batteries and other accessories that would extend the life of the phone far into the future-which brings us to our next trend.\n\nThe need to reinvent the smartphone has never been greater, as once booming sales have slowed across almost all manufactures, including Apple . The problem is that rival companies have focused on creating faster processors, better displays, and better cameras year after year. Now that the technology has moved far enough along, people are finding it harder and harder to justify buying a new smartphone. So many companies will begin bundling their phones with new accessories like virtual reality headsets, 360-degree cameras that will film content for those headsets, and extra batteries. Expect more and more things to plug into the bottom of next-generation smartphones.\n\nWhen the hell will we finally see more flagship smartphones with 4K displays? Probably not at MWC 2016. We're expecting nicer, brighter displays than ever before-but none of the will reach the same glory that we saw in the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium last year. It's looking like we'll have to wait yet another year to cross this one off our wish list.\n\nThere's mounting interest in the fifth generation of wireless broadband data-5G-which will bring even faster speeds to mobile devices that than ever before. Although the 5G standards haven't been finalized yet, we expect plenty of panels and conversations surrounding the arrival of 5G. We probably won't see 5G internet in 2016, but there should be a very clear roadmap as to when it might arrival after Mobile World Congress. If smartphones are to remain a part of our everyday lives, faster internet is crucial, and we should learn more about how soon faster wireless internet might arrive.", "Display systems have definitely advanced much over the years, and we seem to get more and more sophisticated by the day. Consumer level displays include those that are curved by the likes of Samsung and Sony, but how about a new kind of display that floats? This is what Mitsubishi has embarked upon, and while it is far from being a regular 3D hologram, Star Wars style, at least this system will project video in mid-air, with the hopes of actually commercializing it in time for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nIn order to get the job done, Mistubishi will use a couple of optical technology, where one of them is a beam splitter that divides incoming photons into reflected and transmitted light, while a retro-reflective sheet will bounce the light back in the same direction where it hailed from. Arranging them in a manner with a display will see the light reconverge in order to form an image which more or less looks as though it floats in thin air..\n\nThe folks over at Mitsubishi have developed worked out an optical simulation program that can figure out the way to arrange the elements so that a 56\" diagonal image that resides a meter from the beam splitter in distance. Challenges are still there, as those who are not used to focusing their eyes on open space would find it difficult to understand just where the aerial images are shown. Hence, you have guide images being projected on walls located on either side so that one can figure out where to look. [Press Release]", "Here's the pop chart round up: Adele is still a sold number 1 with her \"25\" album. Even the Grammys couldn't knock her off. She sold 124,000 albums last week, god bless her. She can buy all the In and Out Burgers she likes. (She should really come to the Vanity Fair Oscar party. They serve them right out of a truck!)\n\nThe number 2 album is by Joey and Rory, a country duo couple. They sold half of Adele's number. But it's a sad story. Joey, the wife, is battling terminal cancer. They have three kids between them, but just one- a two year old girl with Down syndrome- is theirs together.\n\nIn Bieber land, \"Purpose\" sold just 38,000 copies this week. But you can add on 50,000 streams. His fans are listening to his music on Spotify and AppleMusic but they don't necessarily want to buy it. What does that mean? Where is he now? Who knows?\n\nRihanna's album \"Anti\" is number 9, with a total including streaming of 66,510. Sales (not streaming) were 28,532 according to hitsdailydouble.com. Not a hit. And she blew off the Grammys. I hope Tidal and Samsung paid her a lot of money.\n\nKanye is nowhere. The album is only on Tidal, it can't be bought, he says it will never be on iTunes. My friends at DefJam must drink themselves to sleep. They don't deserve to be treated this badly by a musical terrorist.", "Samsung started pushing Android 6.0 to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge earlier this week, and now it looks like the push has been extended to another Galaxy flagship.\n\nAndroid 6.0.1 appears to be rolling out to the Galaxy Note 5, at least the model that's available in Cambodia (SM-N920C). SamMobile reports that the update is being offered through Samsung's Smart Switch software. The update is build N920CXXU2BPB6.\n\nSamsung's version of Android 6.0 looks fairly similar to its version of Android 5.1, save for a status bar theme that's now white and blue rather than the multiple shades of blue that it was before. There are some new software features for Note 5 owners to look forward to, though. Samsung has updated its browser app to version 4.0 and added features like Secret Mode, which will let you browse without having your history or passwords saved. Also included is Cross App, which lets you open one app while inside another. For example, you could get an in-app browser after clicking a link in your messaging app.\n\nFinally, Note 5 owners can expect standard Android 6.0 features like Google Now on Tap, improved app permissions, and the battery optimizations that come with Doze mode.\n\nThe bad news is that it there don't appear to be any reports of Note 5 units getting Android 6.0.1 outside of Cambodia. That means that most Note 5 owners will have to continue to wait for their helping of Marshmallow. The good news is that it appears that work on the update is done, and so hopefully we'll start seeing it appear in other regions soon.", "In fact, at the same time the Mobile World Congress is taking place, the event organizers, the GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association), will also be hosting their annual Ministerial Programme, a platform for discussing \"the most pressing issues affecting the future of the mobile industry.\"\n\nOrganized under the theme of \"Connecting Everyone and Everything to a Better Future,\" this year's event will focus on the role of mobile technology in global economic and social development.\n\nThe Mobile World Congress will also feature plenty of shiny new product debuts and pre-opening press events.

Now previously one of the rumors suggested that the phone might pack a 12MP camera, lower than its predecessor in the megapixel count.\n\nTurns out that the rumors could be true, because newly leaked information has corroborated the earlier claims. However if you think that Samsung is \"downgrading\" its camera, they're not. Instead according to the leaked information, the 12MP camera uses a slightly larger sensor at 1/2.5-inches, with individual pixel sizes of at least 1.4 microns, making this bigger than most phones.\n\nIn addition to the camera, the new leak also suggests that Samsung could be improving on the sound of the Galaxy S7/S7 Edge. The earpiece's speaker is said to be able to to output 1.2W while the phone's loudspeakers are said to be capable of 1.5W. These claims seem to be in line with a report from last year that suggested that audio quality could be one of Samsung's focuses for the Galaxy S7.\n\nIn any case it's best taken with a grain of salt for now, but do check back with us this coming Sunday where all will be officially revealed!", "In fact, at the same time the Mobile World Congress is taking place, the event organizers, the GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association), will also be hosting their annual Ministerial Programme, a platform for discussing \"the most pressing issues affecting the future of the mobile industry.\"\n\nOrganized under the theme of \"Connecting Everyone and Everything to a Better Future,\" this year's event will focus on the role of mobile technology in global economic and social development.\n\nThe Mobile World Congress will also feature plenty of shiny new product debuts and pre-opening press events.

Some of its regular mobile phones are responsible for the evolution of the displays, mobile cameras, among other upgrades.\n\nIn just two days Samsung is going to unveil its next big thing - the Galaxy S7 series. To honor the event Samsung has posted a video, which will take you back to the very beginning when the phones were bigger than bricks.\n\nSamsung's latest UNPACKED event is going to happen on February 21 in Barcelona. Stay tuned!", "Prepare to meet the biggest premium phone Samsung has made. No, not the Note5, even that one is dwarfed by the Samsung Galaxy A9 and its 6\" Super AMOLED screen.\n\nThe A9 is a new addition to the Galaxy A lineup (the original topped out with the 5.7\" A8) and is undeniably the star of the Galaxy A series. It has a massive 6\" Super AMOLED and it outruns the other As with a Snapdragon 652 chipset (an early taste of the latest Cortex-A72 processor).\n\nThere are little things too, like doubling the internal storage to 32GB, bumping the battery to 4,000mAh, upping the selfie camera to 8MP and even bringing faster LTE.\n\nThe Snapdragon 652 is built on the old 28nm process, but unlike the S615 used in lower-order Galaxy As, half of its cores are the fast Cortex-A72 type (the successor to the A57). A more powerful Adreno 510 GPU and 4K video capture put the cherry on top.\n\nExcept that's not enabled on the Galaxy A7. Like its siblings it maxes out at 1080p @ 30fps, you don't even get even 60fps. You still get the same main camera, though - 13MP f/1.9 with optical image stabilization.\n\nSamsung Galaxy A9 (2016) official images\n\nThe A5 (2016) was a lower-cost alternative to the S6, the A7 (2016) didn't quite reach S6 edge+ levels, but it was a solid upgrade over the original A7.\n\nSo where does the Galaxy A9 (2016) fit in?

Apple should get the security or find other people.\"\n\nWatch Trump's full rant against Apple and Tim Cook in the video below:", "Has Samsung found the holy grail for mobile virtual reality? That's a question VR enthusiasts have been pondering ever since the consumer electronics giant released a teaser video for Unpacked, its press event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this weekend.\n\nSamsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S7 handset at Unpacked, but the video didn't actually show the new phone. Instead, it featured a young man putting on a Gear VR headset, looking around, then leaning forward, and reaching for -- something.\n\nThis has led to numerous speculations in the VR community, because until now, what's shown in the video just hasn't been possible with Samsung's Gear VR.\n\nThat's because the Gear VR doesn't have a feature that's known in the industry as positional tracking. In a nutshell, positional tracking is a way for a VR headset, and apps running on it, to know what a user is physically doing.\n\nFacebook-owned Oculus has made positional tracking a key component of its Rift VR headset. The $600 headset will come with an external sensor that looks a bit like a designer desk lamp when it ships next month. Pointed towards the user, this sensor can keep track of head (and by proxy body) movements within a small predetermined space.\n\nUsers can't quite walk around freely; after all, the Rift headset still requires cables to plug into a PC. But it's enough to duck and move out of a way when a virtual dinosaur approaches, move towards or away from objects, head a virtual soccer ball or even just feel that you're really there within any VR experience.\n\nHTC's Vive headset takes the same concept even further, and uses two so-called lighthouse trackers to keep tabs on a user within a 10\u00d710-foot space. This has allowed for amazingly immersive experiences, which include the ability to draw images in a 3D space, and then walk around those images to look at them from all sides -- something that also won over acclaimed Disney animator Glen Keane.\n\nThe Gear VR, and other mobile VR solutions like Google's Cardboard, offer none of these features. Instead, they just allow for rotational tracking, which means that they can keep track of users turning their head, but not moving within a 3D space. Some developers have tried to overcome these constraints with clever tricks. But overall, it has severely limited what developers can do with these headsets, and how consumers can experience immersion with them.\n\nThe reason for Gear VR not offering positional tracking is twofold. First, the headset doesn't ship with any kind of external tracking sensor like the ones included with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets. But sensors are only part of the puzzle.\n\nTo actually include the position and movements of users in a VR experience, developers have to rely on real-time rendering, something that requires a lot of computing power -- which is why consumers will need a state-of-the-art $1,000 PC with a high-end graphics card to use the Oculus Rift.\n\nProcessing signals with minimal latency is especially important for these kind of experiences. Our brain expects immediate visual feedback when we turn our head or move our body to look around -- even a delay of a few milliseconds can lead to nausea in VR.\n\nThat's not to say that positional tracking is impossible for mobile VR headsets. Mobile phones get better and faster chipsets every year, and Samsung is expected to use a new chipset that it boasts will enable \"highly immersive 3D gaming and life-like virtual reality experiences\" for the Galaxy S7.\n\nNew chips like this could go a long way towards enabling positional tracking, but the company would still need to figure out a way to actually track users' motions. That's why a rumor from last fall that Samsung was adding dual cameras, capable of measuring depth, was so interesting.\n\nSee More: Virtual Reality Used to Be All About Tech. Sundance Hints It's Becoming a Medium\n\nOf course, it's also possible that Samsung could outsource tracking to the headset itself. That's the strategy of Leap Motion, a company that originally developed a sensor for gesture tracking for laptops and PCs that is based on the combination of infrared and traditional cameras. Leap Motion just unveiled a new technology called Orion meant to bring motion tracking to VR headsets.\n\nThe company is looking to license Orion to VR headset makers to include into their hardware, and representatives have told reporters that it expects several companies to incorporate its technology into its headsets later this year. Leap Motion hasn't named any partners yet, but the company's CTO will coincidentally speak at Samsung's developer conference in April.\n\nDoes that mean that Samsung will announce positional tracking for Gear VR this weekend? Not necessarily. The company may as well just boast the S7's graphics processing power as ideal for VR, and enthusiasts may have read too much into a few seconds of promotional video.\n\nBut multiple VR industry insiders have told Variety that there is no doubt that Samsung is working on some kind of positional tracking. And when the company finally does introduce this technology, it may just be able to close the gap between mobile and stationary VR.", "In fact, at the same time the Mobile World Congress is taking place, the event organizers, the GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association), will also be hosting their annual Ministerial Programme, a platform for discussing \"the most pressing issues affecting the future of the mobile industry.\"\n\nOrganized under the theme of \"Connecting Everyone and Everything to a Better Future,\" this year's event will focus on the role of mobile technology in global economic and social development.\n\nThe Mobile World Congress will also feature plenty of shiny new product debuts and pre-opening press events.

Released in October, the \"Connected Women 2015\" report identified a strong gender gap among mobile phone users in low- and middle-income countries, with a total of 200 million fewer women than men owning mobile phones.\n\n\"Mobile phones help women feel safer and more connected, save time and enable access to key services such as mobile money and health information,\" GSMA director general Anne Bouverot wrote in the introduction to the \"Connected Women 2015\" study. \"They offer a cost-effective channel for delivering services and have the potential to increase access to education and employment opportunities, an area where women are still disadvantaged in many parts of the world.\"\n\nDisruption, AI and More\n\nIn addition to emphasizing the potential of mobile tech for boosting economic development around the world, expect this year's congress to also focus more attention on topics like \"identity , privacy and security ,\" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson wrote earlier this month in a blog post.\n\n\"The value for business leaders and marketers is precisely to look beyond the media headlines: understanding how mobile is disrupting businesses, discovering mobile specialists offering advanced intelligence , attribution and engagement solutions, meeting innovative entrepreneurs gathered at 4YFN (4 Years From Now) connecting startups showcase, figuring out the dynamics of the app economy, and shifting the focus of innovation from the Silicon Valley to emerging countries,\" he said.\n\nOther areas that will get plenty of attention at this year's Mobile World Congress include 5G connectivity, wearables, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Among the keynote speakers scheduled during the four days of the conference are Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and China Mobile Chairman Shang Bing.", "At a rally in South Carolina on Friday, presidential candidate Donald Trump called on attendees to boycott Apple over the company's resistance to unlocking one of the San Bernardino shooter's iPhones.

I just thought of it. Boycott Apple.\" A true feat of extemporaneous speaking.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's Twitter account was publishing tweets about his speech from an iPhone.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in September that Trump tweets from an iPhone in the evenings (usually dictating tweets to an assistant during the day). But the New York Times reported in October that he uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. Presumably Trump's tweets during his Friday speech were pre-programmed or coming from an aide. Either way, his team is going to need to shape up.\n\nTrump has expressed strong feelings about Apple before. In January 2014 he said he had sold all of his Apple stock ahead of the company's first quarter earnings because of \"their dumb refusal to give the option of a larger iPhone screen like Samsung.\"\n\nNow Trump supporters with iPhones face the challenge of reconciling their allegiances.", "The future is here - virtual reality is finally launching for consumers.\n\nAnd this isn't just the launch of a new product - VR's arrival represents the starting point of an entirely new market. As of March 28th - when the first batch of Oculus' Rift headsets ship - we are in uncharted territory.\n\n\"We simply don't have the kind of data and business information at our disposal that might help inform the launch of, for example, a new console, PC component or game. So in marketing terms we have to make a lot of assumptions and best guesses,\" HTC Europe's marketing boss Jon Goddard says.\n\n\"But the team at HTC and Valve are able to draw on our experience both from the hardware and software worlds, which gives us a great insight into what VR enthusiasts and PC gamers will want in a consumer VR system.\"\n\nFormer PlayStation VR developer Dave Ranyard - who left Studio London last week - adds: \"Releasing a games console is pretty difficult, but doing it when it's a brand new medium, it's like a challenge on steroids.\"\n\n\"A high initial price point means that companies are\n\nable to balance supply and demand. Over time, that\n\nprice will come down as manufacturing costs drop.\"\n\nEven before it launches, virtual reality is running into some hurdles. The new tech does not come cheap. Oculus has announced a \u00a3500 price tag for its Rift headset, and it's widely presumed that PlayStation VR and HTC's Vive headset will have similar price points.\n\n\"As this is a brand new category it's very hard to really say if a price is high or not because there's no benchmark,\" Goddard explains.\n\n\"So you end up dealing with perceived value, which is a tough one to overcome. What's important is that there's excellent content to match the demand for VR, and that's ultimately what will drive people's view of whether the hardware justifies the cost.\"\n\nRanyard adds: \"That higher price point just means they are able to balance supply and demand. Over time it can come down and they will be able to lower the cost of their manufacturing process.\"\n\nYet there are cheaper options on the market. Samsung has teamed up with Oculus to develop its Gear VR hardware, and start-up Merge VR (pictured above) launched its tech last year. Both of these use mobile phones rather than integrated hi-res screens. And with a considerably lower price point - Gear VR costs \u00a399; Merge has a \u00a349.99 RRP - this could be one way in which VR is adopted by the mass market.\n\n\"It's hard to say. Mobile experiences are much easier to show your mates down at the pub,\" Ranyard admits. \"There might be a lot of people who try VR for the first time with that - it'll be relatively easy. They can get a great experience, but it's what those experiences are. There could be a first taste that comes through those mobile-based headsets.\"\n\nMerge VR co-founder Andrew Trickett adds: \"Mobile VR is going to allow for earlier adoption, and the higher end systems are going to be quite expensive for a while.\n\n\"Mobile VR will continue to be the dominant player, at least in terms of numbers of devices out there.\"\n\nThere will surely be a number of different ways in which the VR giants are going to be selling the tech to the masses. But one thing is clear - consumers need to try the hardware before they will buy it.\n\n\"The turnaround moment for most people is trying it,\" Ranyard says. \"And once they have, they are on board. That's the biggest challenge. It's the exact same one we had when we first made Singstar. Prior to that, nobody had sung at a TV set in a living room and there's quite a few barriers to that. So that was all about sampling and getting people to play it and play it at each other's houses. Getting it exposed on TV, the web to get people and so on.\n\n\"But also, companies need to make content that isn't just a long-form solo video game experience that's all about twitch gameplay. That's not going to sell it to somebody else who comes round to your house. You need more short form, more social 'in the room' experiences so people get it.\"\n\nMerge tried something a little bit different in pushing its VR headset.\n\n\"Being a start-up, we used a lot of social media and PR to get the message out about Merge VR,\" Trickett says.\n\n\"We had a fantastic Christmas period and a lot of that had to do with getting on gift guides, rather than the tech press. That's the way you get the message out to the masses, making them aware of this option, even if they haven't had the chance to experience it themselves.\"\n\n\"We promoted Merge VR in Christmas gift guides rather than the tech press. That's how you get the message out to the masses.\"\n\nAndrew Trickett, Merge VR\n\nMerge launched its mobile VR headset last October, and in the UK it partnered up with High Street retailer GAME to sell the new tech in its stores.\n\n\"One thing we have seen is that VR is incredibly powerful,\" Trickett says.\n\n\"When people try it they realise it's here. Very good, affordable consumer-grade virtual reality is here. But on the other hand, it's an experiential thing. There's no way you can appreciate that unless you try it. We're big believers in physical retail being a key part of introducing it to a mass market.\n\n\"That will be a lot of people's first encounter with VR. Over the last couple of years, it's been early adopters who've been seeking it out or they closely follow the tech press. They hear about it and maybe purchase it online. What we're finding out when we're going to more general events is that vast majority of the consumer market has not even heard about VR. If we put it on their face it's an incredible reaction. That's why it's a big part of our strategy.\"\n\nHTC's Goddard says that the firm is keen to get into physical retail, but that stores need to work hard to push the hardware.\n\n\"Having a Vive just sitting in a box on a shelf is unlikely to do much for a retailer,\" he explains.\n\n\"So they will certainly need to work out the best way to excite their customers about VR with creative executions in store, opportunities for demonstration and interaction, and smart targeting of their database.\"\n\nFormer PlayStation VR dev Dave Ranyard does not think this year, or the next, is going to be when virtual reality takes off.\n\n\"I wonder if in 2016 or 2017 there'll be a little bit of an anticlimax,\" he explains.\n\n\"The VR market will grow, but I wonder if it'll dip at some point where the first wave finishes. Everybody has tried it and gone 'right, okay' and virtual reality will stall a bit and then there's a second surge in a couple of years. It might be the second generation of headsets that make it mainstream and not the first.\n\nNo-one has really commented on that because everyone's so excited about it starting.\n\n\"There'll be a load of fanfare, it'll be great, then there'll be some kind of apocalyptic news stories because sales are down or there isn't any content coming out. But then it'll pick up again.\"\n\n\"There's still a load of things to happen after this - this is just the beginning. There's stuff like having virtual reality headsets wireless, or having eye tracking. There's all this other things that can add to the experience that might be in the second wave - Oculus 2, or PlayStation VR 2 - that might be two or three years down the road that solve a lot of the teething problems. They might be a lot lighter on your head, those sorts of things.\"", "US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called for a boycott of Apple products until the tech company agrees to help the US government unlock the mobile phone of one of the killers in the San Bernardino, California, attack.\n\n\"Boycott Apple until such time as they give that information,\" Trump said at a campaign event in Pawleys Island, South Carolina.\n\n\"It just occurred to me.\"\n\nTrump made the off-the-cuff comment at a town hall-style event at a country club in Pawleys Island, a day before that state's Republican presidential nominating contest.\n\nTrump's spokeswoman said the real estate mogul does not use an iPhone.\n\n\"I use both iPhone & Samsung.

Samsung, LG, and other popular smartphone-makers use the convention as a launching pad for all their new products. Gadget fiends that we are, we can't wait.\n\nWhile there will definitely be major smartphone releases, there are also likely to be some interesting smaller announcements as well. We sifted through the heaps of rumors surrounding the show to find out exactly what will be happening this year. Here's exactly what you can expect from MWC 2016\n\nFor the last couple of years, Samsung has used MWC to build hype around its newest flagship smartphone. This year probably won't be much different. Samsung will almost definitely release a new 5.5-inch flagship smartphone dubbed the Galaxy S7. The successor to last year's flagship, the Galaxy S6, the new phone will look nearly identical to its predecessor. We expect it to have a 12-megapixel camera, 2,800mAH battery, and a micro-SD card slot. Although it's been rumored for months that the phone would include USB-C charging, the most recent leaked photos show a Galaxy S7 with a standard micro-USB charging cable. Plug right into the past.\n\nSamsung's greatest Android rival, LG, is also an MWC veteran, and this year, the company will provide details about its latest flagship, the G5. The phone is rumored to sport a brand new Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB of RAM, and a smaller battery than before. All of that basically means that the smartphone is mostly a bunch of incremental updates across the board. It will be a little thinner, a little faster, and a little zippier all around.\n\nBut perhaps the most interesting rumor surrounding the LG G5 is the fact that company will introduce something called a \"Magic Slot,\" which will allow people to upgrade their smartphone using replaceable parts. The Magic Slot is intended to turn the G5 into something of a modular smartphone, meaning that people can plug in new cameras, batteries and other accessories that would extend the life of the phone far into the future -- which brings us to our next trend.\n\nThe need to reinvent the smartphone has never been greater, as once booming sales have slowed across almost all manufactures, including Apple. The problem is that rival companies have focused on creating faster processors, better displays, and better cameras year after year. Now that the technology has moved far enough along, people are finding it harder and harder to justify buying a new smartphone. So many companies will begin bundling their phones with new accessories like virtual reality headsets, 360-degree cameras that will film content for those headsets, and extra batteries. Expect more and more things to plug into the bottom of next-generation smartphones.\n\nWhen the hell will we finally see more flagship smartphones with 4K displays? Probably not at MWC 2016. We're expecting nicer, brighter displays than ever before -- but none of the will reach the same glory that we saw in the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium last year. It's looking like we'll have to wait yet another year to cross this one off our wish list.\n\nThere's mounting interest in the fifth generation of wireless broadband data -- 5G -- which will bring even faster speeds to mobile devices that than ever before. Although the 5G standards haven't been finalized yet, we expect plenty of panels and conversations surrounding the arrival of 5G. We probably won't see 5G internet in 2016, but there should be a very clear roadmap as to when it might arrival after Mobile World Congress. If smartphones are to remain a part of our everyday lives, faster internet is crucial, and we should learn more about how soon faster wireless internet might arrive.", "Google messed up smart glasses for years to come.

MasterCard says by requiring a user to blink during the selfie photo, hackers or thieves won't be able to beat the system by just holding up a photo of the account holder.\n\nMasterCard isn't the only company toying with new technology. HSBC will soon let account holders access accounts via voice and fingerprints.\n\nApple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay all let users authorize payments with a fingerprint.\n\nBut MasterCard may be going a step further.

The demo unit was just a mock-up, though HP assured me it was the same weight and size as the shipping model.\n\nLike all Windows phones, I have a feeling the Elite X3 will be loved by tech journalists who are desperate to review something different, but I'm not sure how well that will translate into sales.\n\nThe question for HP is do we really need this? As more enterprise customers switch to Office 365 or Google Docs, much of the work we do is already hosted in the cloud, and synced between our phones and computers.\n\nI guess HP is looking at it from another angle. As more companies require their users have a work phone as well as a work computer, why not combine the two? HP is betting its enterprise customers would like to purchase just one device that can be both. If HP can pull it off, it may just breath life into the almost dead Windows phone market.\n\nMORE FROM MWC:\n\nHands on with Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge Meet LG's modular smartphone and 'friends' Huawei's Windows tablet in Apple clothing\n\nFollow Digital Life on Twitter", "Smartwatch shipments just beat Swiss watches for the first time ever\n\nNearly 50 years after Captain Kirk used his wristwatch communicator on Star Trek, today's smartwatches have finally started to overtake traditional ones.\n\nThe newest data on global smartwatch shipment estimates for the fourth quarter 2015 show that the smartwatches surpassed Swiss Watch shipments for the first time, according to Strategy Analytics.\n\nGlobal smartwatch shipments for the quarter totaled 8.1 million units, which edged the 7.9 million Swiss Watches. Smartwatch shipments have surpassed Swiss Watches in different regions intermittently, but this is the first time it has happened globally, which could indicate that the smartwatch market is finally gaining some real momentum among customers around the world.\n\nStrategy Analytics' report also revealed that demand for smartwatches is increasing, particularly in North America, Western Europe, and Asia. The 8.1 million global smartwatch shipments in the fourth quarter 2015 marked a staggering 316% year-over-year growth from 1.9 million in Q4 2014.\n\nThe report also noted that Apple and Samsung represent 8 of every 10 smartwatches shipped. Apple Watches made up 63% of the global smartwatch shipments in the fourth quarter, while Samsung accounted for 16%.\n\nFinally, Strategy Analytics' showed that Swiss Watch brands have not been nimble in their response to the growing smartwatch trend. The 7.9 million units shipped marked a 5% decline from 8.3 million in the year-ago period. Some high-end brands such as Tag Heuer have debuted their own smartwatches, but these make up just 1% of all smartwatches shipped in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis data is one indication that smartwatches will continue to expand their presence on the market in the coming years.

We've gone hands-on with the two devices, we've taken an in-depth look at the camera they are sporting (paying special attention to the autofocus mechanism), and we've even seen a teardown of the S7 already.\n\nAnd now we have some new information about the camera which is included in both the Galaxy S7 and the S7 edge. Despite what many rumors had claimed, Samsung hasn't used its own Britecell sensor. This is obvious from the camera's specs, when you consider that the Britecell sensor has 1 micron pixel size, while the S7 duo employs one with pixels that are 40% larger.\n\nIt turns out that the sensor Samsung is using for the S7 models is made by Sony, and its model number is IMX260. This follows in the footsteps of the IMX240 which was used last year in the Galaxy S6 line and the Note5. Both the Galaxy S7 and the S7 edge should use this Sony IMX260 sensor in all markets, which means image quality is going to be the exact same everywhere. Interestingly, the front-facing camera's sensor is identical to the one from 2015's flagships.\n\nOn the other hand, it looks like Samsung has developed a custom audio chip for the S7 family. A device info app identifies this as the \"Lucky CS47L91 Sound\" - and \"Project Lucky\" was actually the codename for the Galaxy S7. So it could be that this is a custom-made chip by the Korean company. Hopefully it will enable higher-quality audio when compared to past top of the line Samsung handsets.", "Yesterday the two biggest Korean smartphone makers both unveiled their respective flagship smartphones for 2016. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 each have their own strengths, of course, and you can read more about those in our detailed hands-on reports for them.\n\nToday, mere 24 hours after they've both had their big events, LG has already taken to Twitter to mock its main competitor's new smartphone.\n\nLG obviously thinks its G5 is better than the Galaxy S7, and wants you to know that too. Apparently the number \"7\" is better used in a list of 'friends of the G5' instead of the name of a new handset. Or something along those lines.\n\nLG clearly wants to emphasize the modularity of the G5, which is one area where Samsung's Galaxy S7 simply can't compete. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether this will actually have any effect on sales of the two devices - LG would like that to be a positive one for the G5 and a negative effect for the S7. But given the history of the two brands, that could be unlikely.", "Samsung will not be shipping the newly unveiled Galaxy S7 and S7 edge with two of the apps we've gotten used to having on its handsets. We're talking about Samsung's music and video playing apps. These will not be part of the package you'll see when you first turn on either smartphone.\n\nInstead, you will get Google Play Music and Play Movies bundled with the two flagships. If you do find yourself missing Samsung's own music and video players, rest assured that they will only ever be a few taps away, as part of the 'Galaxy Essentials' pack in the Galaxy Store. From there you can quickly download either one of them (or both) and start using it (or them) in no time.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft's app suite will come preinstalled on the S7 duo - think Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, and Skype. And that makes sense when you consider that Microsoft is probably paying Samsung for the inclusion of these apps on its devices.", "As smart phones continue to grow smarter, many people are now rejecting the increased connectivity and taking a huge step backward.\n\nEmbraced by average mobile users and high-profile figures alike, including British actor Eddie Redmayne, the 'dumbphone' is making a comeback, and it can only perform the most basic functions.\n\nDitching complex handsets, 'dumbphone' users actually have to use their phones as a phones, limiting functionality to calls and texts, and freeing up time otherwise spent glued to a screen.\n\nAs smart phones continue to grow smarter, many people are now rejecting the increased connectivity and taking a huge step backward.

While they look almost identical to the S6 line, Samsung is bringing back a memory-card slot and adding a longer-life battery after the absence of a removable power unit alienated fans last year.\n\nSamsung's efforts to win back customers saw it keep the form and shape of last year's models while fixing its shortcomings and touting their potential role in the coming virtual reality boom. With earnings sliding in a stalling smartphone market and the shares battered by three straight annual declines, South Korea's biggest company needs a hit product after the S6 failed to set the records that had been predicted.\n\n\"Samsung's trying to shift consumers' sights to bundled products, such as VR headsets and a 360 degree camera, which would help it keep the smartphone margin from decline,\" Lee Jae Yun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co., said in Seoul. \"This is a good try but Samsung can't help slashing the prices of new premium smartphones to keep its market share. \"\n\nReduced drain\n\nAt the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, Samsung took the wraps off a 360-degree camera designed to work with the S7. Ian Fogg, an analyst with IHS Technology, called the Gear 360 accessory a \"halo\" product that will help boost sales of the smartphone in a decelerating global market.\n\n\"The market for the smartphone is obviously slowing down a little bit,\" Jean-Daniel Ayme, vice president of European telecom operations at Samsung, said in an interview. \"When you're using one of these new devices, this is more than a phone, this is your camera, your MP3 player, your TV, your recorder, it's everything and more, and more is coming.\"\n\nSamsung abandoned removable batteries and a memory card slot from its marquee phone last year as it sought to make its devices thinner. The move backfired as it eliminated two key ways in which the company's devices were differentiated from iPhones. Samsung cut prices on the S6 smartphones in July last year, just three months after launch. Ayme said the company has managed to crack the power issue.\n\n\"This phone is more powerful than any phone we have launched in the past, but it also has optimized software that will reduce the battery drain, and we have managed to put a larger battery in a smaller package,\" Ayme said.\n\nHeads up\n\nInvestors are keeping an eye on the smartphone's public unveiling, and on its ability to stand out from a thicket of devices -- from LG Electronics Inc.'s G5 and Xiaomi Corp.'s Mi 5 -- that are being unveiled in Spain. LG's 5.3-inch smartphone will go on sale globally as early as the end of March, except in Japan, said Woo Ram Chan, vice president of LG's mobile product planning division.\n\nThe stock fell 1.3 percent to close at 1,175,000 won in Seoul. Itsshares have declined about 7 percent so far this year after dropping 5.1 percent in 2015.\n\nThe new S7 models are waterproof for as long as 30 minutes in water 1.5 meters deep and come in gold, silver, white and black. Also included is wireless charging and Marshmallow, the latest version of Google Inc.'s Android operating system.\n\nThe Galaxy maker, which is banking on Samsung Pay as another differentiator, added a list of regional banks and credit unions, including the Charlotte Metro Credit Union and NCPA Federal Credit Union, to the list of partners for its mobile payments service. The platform will be rolled out in China next month.\n\nZero to hero\n\nSamsung's codename for the S7 development project was 'Hero' while last year's plan for the S6 adopted the title 'Zero' as the company tried to return to the fundamentals in its design.\n\nThis year's models hit the market about a month earlier than the S6 did in 2015. While wireless carriers will decide on prices and calling plans, the S7s will probably be at a similar price level to last year's device, according to Drew Blackard, director of product marketing at Samsung. Some operators could include a free Gear VR headset with the S7, the company said without elaborating.\n\nThe Gear 360 camera features two back-to-back fisheye lenses that each can capture a 180-degree image and stream it to the S7, earlier S6 models and the Note 5.\n\nSocial networks, including Facebook Inc. and Google's YouTube, recently starting supporting 360-degree videos -- a format used by virtual reality hardware, and which on regular computers and mobile devices allows viewers to dynamically alter the angle they view a scene from.\n\nShrinking share\n\nAyme says this, coupled with the Samsung's S7, Gear 360 camera and Gear VR headset, gives consumers a full taste of virtual reality, allowing consumers to create their own content rather than waiting for it to become commercially available.\n\n\"Something that used to be only accessible to a few people with a lot of knowledge about computing and with very powerful computing engines, is now available to everybody,\" he said.\n\nWhether virtual reality will prove an effective selling point remains to be seen. While the South Korean company remains the world's largest smartphone producer, its global market share fell in 2015 as Apple, Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. won customers, according to researcher Strategy Analytics Inc.\n\nSamsung last month warned of falling global demand and economic turbulence after its quarterly earnings missed analysts' estimates.\n\nSamsung, which misread demand for the S6 when it failed to produce enough three-sided screens for the Edge, said it won't face the same problem this year.", "The Mobile Zone is brought to you in partnership with CA Technologies. Super-speed development with powerful backend SDKs and APIs for devs with CA Mobile App Services.\n\nSamsung recently debuted the latest iteration of their flagship Galaxy phone series, the S7. A constant innovator, the S7 packs a load of features, and while there might not be massive differences from its predecessor, the S6, noteworthy alterations promise to deliver for both users and developers alike.\n\nThe S7 comes in two variants, the S7 and S7 Edge. While the S6 and S6 Edge featured improved design, Samsung omitted water resistance, expandable storage, and a removable battery. Though the S7 may appear similar to the S6, it's a smattering of small changes that make the S7 a marked improvement over the previous generation. Notably, the MicroSD slot has made a comeback, which allows for up to an additional 200gb of storage, alongside 32gb built in. There's also IP68 dust and water resistance. Sealed ports mean no mandatory (and often cumbersome) rubber port covers.\n\nBattery life has been boosted, with 3,000mAh for the S7, and 3,600mAh in the Edge. A major concern for developers in the mobile space is battery life. Since limited battery capacity is a worry for consumers, it also affects developers. Devs are thus forced to concentrate on low power consumption in their apps. Though the S7 battery is still not removable, the beefier battery should meet developers and general user needs.\n\nRAM and processor upgrades make the S7 a true powerhouse phone. 4gb of RAM is standard, and a Snapdragon 820 processor provides a performance boost over the former Exynos chip. Virtual reality (VR) has blossomed in the mobile space, from budget headsets like the Google Cardboard to Samsung's own Gear VR. Accordingly, Samsung considered the prominence of VR when upgrading the S7.\n\nIf they made a Galaxy S7 developer edition is AOSP build I would buy 4 of them, no joke -- Fade Autumn (\n\n@blesstheautumn) February 9, 2016\n\nMany of the hardware changes are to accommodate breaking technology integrations, like VR. Powering virtual reality apps and headsets requires more computing performance, hence the 4gb of RAM, and Snapdragon 820. The return of the MicroSD slot means users have more native room for content and app storage. However, a noteworthy change is the exclusion of \"adoptable storage.\" The S7 does tout Marshmallow, but not Marshmallow's capability to reformat the MicroSD as unified storage for apps and files. Android Central writer Russell Holly explored the potentially groundbreaking VR potential of the S7, which comes loaded with Vulkan APIs. Renowned game developer Brianna Wu and Vulkan developer Sascha Willems lent their expertise to Holly's article. Even the Micro USB port was kept as its compatible with the Gear VR.

Telefonica said the goal is to deploy service operation centers in each country in which it operates. These centers will monitor in real time the customer quality of experience and the quality of service to proactively tackle issues.\n\nThe SOC implementations are set to begin before the end of the year in Argentina and Chile, with further expansion planned for Spain and Germany. By the end of 2017, Telefonica said it plans to have rolled out the SOCs across all of its markets.

Last November, C\u00e9sar Alierta, executive chairman of Telefonica, said the telco has defined itself as a company promoting connections in life for people to choose a world of infinite possibilities. Alierta disclosed the strategic plan comprised six key elements: connectivity, integrated offerings, differential experience, big data, end-to-end digitalization and capital allocation/simplification.\n\nThe most recent announcement follows Alierta's statement that Telefonica was going to place the defense of its customers' interests at the center of its stance, which will focus on three concepts: digital trust, open Internet and digital access.\n\nJuan Manuel Caro, Telfonica's global director of operations and operating support systems, explained the big data analytics project will help the telco better understand customer demands and help the carrier to better manage its resources.\n\n\"It changes our view to look at network,\" Caro said, adding with the SOCs, Telefonica will be able to use data to understand trends and act proactive.\n\n\"We knew what to do, but now we will know first if customers are facing issues with the network,\" said Blanco. \"And this is a key factor when see prepare ourselves to the traffic data growth.\"\n\nEditors note: Samsung provided travel costs to MWC\n\nShare on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) big data analytics LATAM Mobile World Congress Telefonica", "Mark Zuckerberg knows a lot about you, including why you love to watch live streams. During his keynote at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg explained why people love live streams, and delved deeper into the complications of giving free Internet access.\n\nLive on air\n\nThe king of social media live streamed his surprise keynote at Samsung's MWC event on Facebook, and accumulated 150,000 concurrent viewers, which he says is \"pretty similar to what you get from a successful TV show.\" Zuckerberg may be bullish on the reach of live streaming, but he did admit that it will take some time before it can reach the scale of TV viewing.\n\nRelated: Mark Zuckerberg talks about the future of VR and 360 video at Galaxy S7 event\n\nFacebook began allowing live streaming last December, and according to Zuckerberg, it offers a reprieve from the pressures of social-media perfection. \"As people share more and more there's this increase in pressure to do well,\" Zuckerberg explained. \"That photo represents what you want in the world.\" To him, live streaming succeeds for the exact opposite reasons; the main draw is the moment shared and not the person. This is what makes live streaming appealing to everyone from \"public figures trying to reach with 150,000 concurrent folks or people trying to connect to friends and family in new intimate way,\" Zuckerberg noted.\n\nInternet via laser\n\nZuckerberg promoted Facebook's continued mission to connect the world with multiple projects aimed at giving Internet access in deprived areas. One project he spoke enthusiastically about is a \"laser comms system,\" which connects users via lasers at a rate Zuckerberg promises is \"12 times faster\" than traditional means. As you might imagine, it's not easy. Zuckerberg compared the precision needed to make it work to \"shooting a laser pointer from California to hitting a quarter on the top of the Statue of Liberty.\"\n\nFirst steps in 360\n\nIt wasn't all live streaming and laser talk for the visibly frustrated Zuckerberg as he battled mic issues and sweat while on stage. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan recently had a child, Maxima Zuckerberg, in November of last year. While Zuckerberg admitted he does not have many parenting stories to share since his daughter is only three months, he did use it as an opportunity he revealed he wishes to capture the entire scene of his child's first steps in 360.\n\nWe may not be close to laser-guided internet, but if Zuckerberg has it his way, we'll all be live streaming our reactions when it does happen.", "Mobile World Congress 2016 is in full swing in Barcelona and for the first full day of the show, we're seeing products that might change how we live.\n\nYesterday was the big day for mobile phones, today is all about things you can wear and fill your home with to make life a little easier.\n\nLet's take a look at what mattered during day one of MWC, and check out our full coverage of the show on CNET.\n\nSmart glasses are back\n\nGoogle Glass has come and gone, but smart glasses are getting a new shot with Epson Everio Smart Glasses. These rather large glasses use OLED screens to create a more natural-looking heads-up display that's not as distracting.\n\nYes, they look a bit dorky, but they have practical uses, like playing 2D or 3D videos, interacting with augmented reality and controlling drones. If you're interested, Epson plans to sell them in late 2016 to average people. No word on pricing.\n\nPlay These shoes could make you a better weightlifter\n\nHone your Crossfit or golfing skills with the Iofit smart shoes. With built-in pressure sensors, they can tell you a lot about your stance when you swing a golf club or weight distribution when you're lifting weights.\n\nThe shoes hail from Samsung's Creative Labs Iofit company and are built in partnership with Korean shoemaker TNS. The companies are launching a Kickstarter campaign starting February 22nd, where you'll be able to preorder them for $199.\n\nA phone that can see through walls\n\nRugged meets practical with the CAT S60, a new phone from Caterpillar (yes, the same company that makes construction equipment). The S60 has a built-in thermal camera from thermal camera maker Flir that can show heat and cold in your environment, which the human eye otherwise can't see.\n\nEven cooler, the back of the phone has a switch so you can toggle between the thermal camera and a regular, 13-megapixel camera. Because it's built by CAT, it's has a rugged design that can handle drops, dirt and water.\n\nPlay Sony's gadgets for the home\n\nSony's been working on lots more than just phones. The company brought a few concept products to MWC. First is the Xperia Projector, which shows apps, like a calendar, the weather, a photo albums or your address book, onto your table or countertop.\n\nThe smaller Xperia Agent also projects helpful info, such as traffic reports and a clock, on a flat surface. It's designed for individuals, while the Projector is built for families.\n\nFinally, the Xperia Ear is a Bluetooth headset that also reads updates from your phone. It will dictate text messages, deliver weather reports and remind you of calendar appointments. This is only product that Sony will actually sell from its lineup of accessories it debuted at the show.\n\nThe Phones of Mobile World Congress 2016... 1 - 5 of 11 Next Prev The phones and tablets we sawSony\n\nTaking a cue from Samsung, Sony's built a curved-screen phone that looks like it has no bezel. The Xperia XA is lacking top-of-the-line specs, but it features a striking, edge-to-edge screen.\n\nThe XA's big brother, the Xperia X has better internal guts and a simpler square design that's become Sony's hallmark. These phones won't wow everyone, but they are a step down from Sony's high-end Xperia Z line.\n\nZTE\n\nCompact and stylish, ZTE showed off the Blade V7 and V7 Lite in Barcelona. The two phones won't hit the US, but you can buy them in Germany, Spain, South Africa, Ethiopia and Mexico in early spring.\n\nAlcatel\n\nAlcatel's Idol 4S is the company's new flagship phone with a super HD screen. It also features a button on the side that you can program to take photos or open a specific app.\n\nThe Idol 4 is a step down from the 4S and features a smaller screen.\n\nLastly, Alcatel's Xess is a giant tablet with a handle on the back. You won't want to slip this into your bag, but it's great for watching videos at home.\n\nExtrasVodafone is helping refugees with a large portable charger with Wi-Fi, so they can connect and power their phones in refugee camps and other remote areas.Verizon is currently testing its faster 5G network. Expect to see faster data speeds in the next few years.AT&T and Intel are working together to give drones 4G LTE connectivity.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg introduced a new project to give Internet access to people in developing countries.\n\nDay one of Mobile World Congress is coming to a close, but there is still plenty of news ahead.

It's an Android-powered device that is priced at \u20ac199 (approximately $220) and is available to everyone in the European Union through Amazon starting in April with pre-orders beginning on March 20.\n\nRumored for the past couple of weeks, the CheetahPhone is the first branded smartphone for the company behind Clean Master and other mobile utility apps. It comes equipped with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, 10 GB of cloud and 32 GB of in-device storage, 3 GB of RAM, Cubot's personalized launcher and its Gallery app with Wi-Fi Transfer to facilitate quick cross-device transfer of images, and also Cheetah Mobile's HD wallpapers and themes.\n\nOther features include having a ARM 64-bit octa-core 1.5GHz processor, a 1920\u00d71080 HD display, fingerprint scanner in the rear of the device, and a 13-megapixel rear Samsung camera along with a 8-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nThe phone measures 149 x 74.9 x 7.95mm and is available in gold, rose gold, and space grey. So by comparison, the CheetahPhone is about as long and wider as the the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, but not as thin.\n\nOne of the selling points is the inclusion of Cheetah Mobile's Clean Master software, which the company claims delivers 38 percent longer battery life when compared to devices using stock Android 5.1.1.\n\nThe CheetahPhone will start off in Europe before expanding to Africa in the upcoming months. A Cubot spokesperson told VentureBeat that the European Union is a major market not just for phones like the CheetahPhone, but the latest way of thinking for Chinese product companies moving into Europe...Sell on Amazon first!\" As of right now, there are no plans to bring the smartphone to the United States.\n\nAlthough Cheetah Mobile has its name associated with the phone, Cubot said that Cheetah Mobile won't be \"involved in distribution and selling of the devices.\" However, we're told, \"Cheetah Mobile will, of course, be working with Cubot to promote the co-branded product. With the Clean Master already having well over 550 million users already, we think this phone will excite the existing Cheetah audience enough to purchase.\"\n\nThe CheetahPhone works with all European carrier networks.", "Thinking of picking up either the Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge? If you are, don't be surprised if you were to launch your phone and discover two apps missing from the handset. The missing apps are Samsung's music and video player. Instead they have been replaced by Google Play Music and Play Movies.\n\nThis more or less corroborates an earlier rumor which suggested that Samsung would be cleaning up the software on their phones, and presumably they are trying to give users more of a stock Android experience by removing those apps from the phone. However if for whatever reason you prefer Samsung's music or video player apps, you can always go ahead and download them.\n\nThey will be part of the Galaxy Essentials from the Galaxy Store, not the Google Play Store, so you will have to launch a different app store if you'd like to get those apps back. Given that stock Android has been one of the more preferred builds of Android since it is usually quite lag-free as it isn't heavily themed/skinned, this change should appeal to fans of the platform.\n\nAlternatively it is possible that maybe Samsung has decided that there could be more users of Google Play Music than its Samsung Music Player, and have decided to make it easier for its users to access Google's music service. Either way it's something to take note of if you are buying either handset.", "With the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, Samsung has brought back a rather useful feature which is water resistance. While we doubt many of you guys actually go swimming with your phone, the peace of mind knowing that should it take an unfortunate swim in your pool or toilet bowl, it will still remain functional.\n\nTo prove how effective the phone is at resisting water, the folks at T-Mobile have decided to put together a video in which T-Mobile's product guy Des Smith unboxes the handset while being submerged underwater. The video is rather humorous as Smith has a snorkel in his mouth because you know, he needs to breathe, but there are subtitles if you are trying to figure out what he's trying to say.\n\nBasically the whole video is just about showing how water resistant the phones are. This is in addition to the high-end specs and features that Samsung has decided to pack into the device, so really, it is just icing on the cake. In the meantime, the major US carriers including T-Mobile have all announced that they will be selling the phone.\n\nPre-orders are expected to kick off on the 23rd of February and will be going on sale on the 11th of March. Pricing of the phone and the payment plans will vary from carrier to carrier, so take your pick on which you think is the best value for your money.", "The decision on which Android smartphone you should be buying has been made a little more complicated by Mobile World Congress (MWC), and we don't just mean which of the new Samsungs to get.\n\nWith its new G5, LG has taken most of us by surprise by going down the modular route - providing users with the option of adding a speaker (made by Bang & Olufsen no less) or a remote to turn the phone into a digital camera. The battery is also removable, so users could swap out a dead one for a fully charged one at a time of need.\n\nThese are head-turning, if not revolutionary ideas, seeing as Google has toyed with modular phones but been unable to get it off the ground.

It feels premium, but is surprisingly and refreshingly light in weight. It's only 159g. On first impression then the G5 ticks several of the key boxes.\n\nThere are a range of colours too including pink, silver and gold that all look stylish, and the 'always on' screen is very on-trend too.\n\nMuch like Samsung, LG has also made a real effort to improve its camera this year. Where it has focussed is the scale of images - introducing a wide-angle lens alongside the standard one on the rear of the phone gives users an option when it comes to photos.\n\nThe wide-angle lens is impressive too, and the contrast was stark when placed next to an iPhone- showing just how much the G5 could now get in the shot.\n\nThen there is the modular aspect. It works fairly simply - the bottom panel of the G5, below the screen and where the LG logo sits, can be released and detached from the phone via a discreet button on the side of the device. When you remove it, the phone's 2,800mAh battery comes with it.\n\nFrom here the battery can be removed and replaced by another, or you can add one of the other modules, or LG Friends as the technology giant is calling them.\n\nThe first of which is LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play.

But crucially, that additional jack can supply high resolution audio playback, upscaling your music to that level in the process.\n\nThe second is LG Cam Plus, a remote that essentially turns your device into a digital camera, adding a physical shutter button so it sits like a camera in your hand. This accessory also adds an extra 1,200mAh battery capacity to the G5.\n\nThe first drawback is that neither of these main accessories match the G5 in any colour, so your phone will most definitely look modular as you use it.\n\nThe other issue lies in the unproven popularity of modular devices. Here, the G5 stands out from other smartphones, but in the wild the question remains as to whether the user would still want to be able to remove their batteries, or swap out for a camera extension. Google's take on this never got going, and perhaps that was for a reason.\n\nWhere LG has also been wildly interesting this MWC is some of the other companion devices to go with the G5.\n\nThe first of which is a fully-fledged robot - the Rolling Bot - designed to be part home security device, part pet-sitter. The Rolling Bot can be controlled remotely via smartphone and used to scan your house, while there's a laser light built in too for pets to chase, as well as a microphone so you can talk to them.\n\nLG has also joined the virtual reality party, introducing 360 VR, its own headset which plugs exclusively into the G5 and uses a single screen for each eye to simulate a 130-inch screen being viewed from two metres away. The image sharpness is impressive, as is the ability to fold up 360 VR and carry it around with it, bringing a new level of mobility to the currently fairly tethered market.", "LONDON, Feb. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Flexible battery's application area is evolving from packaging segment to consumer electronics devices.

Just in time for the very brief period of time in which the device's names don't match. As we discussed previously, it's quite possible that this round will be Samsung's - from what we're looking at here, there's more than a couple reasons to believe that to be true. The raw specifications are here as well - see how similar the two seem on the surface.\n\nWhile these two devices might pass for one another on a train, while someone holding said device is running in the other direction, they're really as different as two flagships can be. Two flagships that are in direct contention with one another in much of the same smartphone market around the world.\n\nFor the most basic of users, these phones are very similar. For the most discerning users, they're quite different.\n\nAbove you'll see the specifications. Samsung has pulled ahead significantly in the display department - with a larger screen (smaller than its \"Edge\" variant, and smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus), yet far more pixels packed therein.\n\nSEE: Samsung Galaxy S7 hands-on (with Galaxy S7 Edge)\n\nWhile Samsung retains the same amount of pixels in its panel as its last release in the Samsung Galaxy S6, it still remains well and above sharper than Apple's offerings in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.\n\nWhat we're most interested to see is how well the Samsung Galaxy S7 does against the iPhone 6s now that it's being delivered (for a short while) with a free virtual reality headset. That's the Samsung Gear VR, and certainly not an offer to scoff at.\n\nWill Apple be forced to move their virtual reality plans forward now that Samsung's revealed such an aggressive release for mobile VR? Probably not. If precedent is any indicator, Apple will still end up taking all the time they need to get in gear, so to speak.", "Thanks to the inclusion of the Vulkan APIs, which we have discussed previously when it was first announced Google intended to bring them to Android, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will bring a much better gaming experience than any smartphone previously.\n\nTo sum it up, Vulkan is a next-generation graphics API. It grants app developers more explicit control over scene rendering, providing direct control over GPU acceleration for maximized performance. Vulkan's specific role is the handling of 3D graphics, then distributing the workload over among multiple CPUs. With a firm control over the graphics, your CPU intensive games can be played not only better, but for longer.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are the first smartphones to offer this currently, but Samsung did not stop there. Pre-installed on the devices is an app called Game Launcher. Instead of opening a game via the app icon as you normally would, open up Game Launcher, choose whether you want to block specific app notifications or enable Game Tools, and then open your game via the selection inside of Game Launcher.\n\nWhen enabled, Game Launcher brings specific tools to your disposal, such as the ability to record gameplay, lock the Recent and Back keys to keep you from accidentally backing out of the game and losing your place, take screenshots, scores and rankings, and more. Users can also specify power-saving options.\n\nThe below video gives a great overview of what Game Launcher does on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.\n\nIf you don't plan on picking up a Galaxy S7, don't worry, Vulkan will likely be making its way to many more smartphones hitting the market this year.", "All of the deals are checked at the time of publication.

On Monday in Auckland's Mantells on the Water, members of Auckland's press gathered for a Samsung popup #GalaxyS7 session, meeting the experts and learning how with the Galaxy S7, Samsung have shown they're open to feedback and willing to listen.\n\nAnd with the S7, Samsung have actually listened. Have you heard that from any other manufacturers? The Galaxy S7 has taken the S6 & S6 Edge, brought the best bits over from the S5, and made devices that should really scare Apple.\n\nThe S7 opens Samsung's market amongst tradies and sportsters, as it has an IP68 water resistant rating, which means it can sit 1.5m underwater for up to 30 minutes with absolutely no damage. Take it out, wipe it off and you're good to go.\n\nBeing water & dust resistant means it's a natural fit for boaties, prophetic given the amazing venue and experience orchestrated by Copper.\n\nWe also got to play with the Gear VR, the Facebook Oculus powered headset that turns the S7 into a full multimedia device - one that will find lots of homes and businesses welcoming it in. Luckily, I've been reliably informed that there should be no photos of me waving my arms around whilst watching Transformers in VR. A\u00adfricking\u00admazing!\n\nImagine being able to give personal training without distraction, or being able to look at Real Estate without being there. The Gear VR, the Gear 360 video camera, and the Galaxy S7 can do it all. The unveiled Gear 360 offers full 360\u00ba image and video capture, making the Gear VR next year's development platform.\n\nThe growth of the S7 will also occur in the commuter belt. The ability for the Gear VR to play for 3 hours on the internal battery, and a lot longer with a powerpack, means trips across the ditch should fly by.\n\nLast but by no means least, the Samsung Gear S2 classic received some updates with Rose Gold and Platinum-plated models. And yes, they're not cheap. With our currency's fall against the US dollar, we're no longer getting good prices on technology, so the new models will stretch you out to $750. The Tizen OS makes for a great experience, and along with the extra battery life crammed into the S7 & S7 Edge, they'll easily see you past one day's use.\n\nImagine that, not having to plug in for a whole night! The wireless charging will go from flat to full in 90 minutes/ I did nearly forget to write the best and most important thing they brought back from the S5:\n\nYes, every S7 or S7 Edge will have 32GB of onboard storage. That's it.\n\nYet they've brought the Micro\u00adSD back. Up to 200GB of lovely cheap expandable storage. Hallelujah Samsung, you really did listen!\n\nThe last thing that really sold it to me was the people. We rarely meet Apple's people, to them, New Zealand is too small to warrant the effort. Yet with Samsung, its people are all great supporters of the product, and are willing to go the extra mile, I wouldn't call them fanboys, just evangelists.\n\nAm I a convert? Well let me get it in my hands for a little longer, and I'll let you know whether it's a good investment, or just another fad to be replaced in a year.", "The Chinese tech company Huawei is looking to expand its growth by breaking into the tablet market. Their new 2-in-1 \"Matebook\" was revealed on Sunday with some impressive features that will surely challenge Apple, Lenovo and Samsung.\n\nIn terms of smartphones, Huawei is not far behind Apple and Samsung. They have far exceeded expectations last year, shipping 108 million smartphones in 2015. With a 44% increase, this puts them in a close third behind Apple and Samsung. Huawei now seeks to take this success in a new direction. The detachable tablet will be the device to lead the way.While tablets, on the whole, are seeing a decrease in sales, the detachable variety is up and coming.\n\nMuch like Apple's iPad Pro, the Matebook will use the detachable keyboard feature that is popular among tablet users these days. As far as an operating system goes, Huawei will follow in the steps of Samsung. Windows 10 will be the operating system on all their new tablets. As far as device features, the Matebook will have a 12-inch display, a fingerprint censor, 512 gigabytes of storage and a 5-megapixel front camera. Colors will come in Champagne white and dark silver. An accessories kit will also be included with a stylus pen, USB, and HDMI adapters. At the moment, we do not know how the price will compare to Apple and Samsung.\n\nHuawei's cost may be a mystery, but Lenovo has made their monetary intentions quite public, and for good reason. Coming in at $229, Lenovo's three new Yoga notebooks are significantly cheaper than their Yoga 900S they released last year. The low cost is an attempt at bringing Windows 10 to a more affordable level for Lenovo users. Even with the low price, consumers won't have to give up their screen size. These new notebooks will come in 15-inch, and 14-inch displays, both bigger than their Huawei competition. Lenovo may not be in first place, but they certainly are offering up some worthy competition for a variety of notebook users.", "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg added his name to the list of tech leaders rallying behind Apple in its encryption debate with the Justice Department, but a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center suggests the FBI is winning over public sentiment.\n\nMark Zuckerberg at Samsung's MWC keynote. | Source: Mark Zuckerberg\n\nSpeaking at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, Zuckerberg said Facebook believes in encryption, adding that software backdoors are not effective and ethically dubious, reports Re/code.\n\n\"We're sympathetic with Apple on this one,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I expect it's not the right thing to try to block that from the mainstream products people want to use. And I think it's not going to be the right regulatory or economic policy to put in place.\"\n\nWhile siding with Apple on the overarching issue of strong encryption, the social media guru hedged his bets and pointed out Facebook does its part by complying with warranted law enforcement data requests. As Apple is currently locking horns with the DOJ over an iPhone tied to last year's San Bernardino shooting, Zuckerberg's comments on Monday had bearing on the government's anti-terrorism cybersecurity campaign.\n\n\"We certainly do have very strong policies on this that if there's any content that's promoting terrorism or sympathizing with ISIS or anything like that, we'll ... get those people off the service. We don't want people that are doing that stuff on Facebook,\" he said.\n\nBeing the world's foremost social network, Facebook has obvious skin in the game when it comes to protecting its users' data. Aside from user-based targeted advertising, the company's WhatsApp messaging service uses end-to-end encryption technology similar to Apple's iMessage, meaning it might see similar government pressure if the DOJ is able to set precedent with Apple.\n\nZuckerberg's appraisal of the developing situation comes days after other influential tech personalities like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and entrepreneur Mark Cuban voiced their support of Apple's fight for encryption. However, the Justice Department is waging its own PR battle for favorable public opinion, and it appears to be going well.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center poll conducted late last week, 51 percent of respondents said Apple should \"unlock the iPhone\" used by San Bernardino terrorist Syed Ryzwan Farook, while 38 percent said the company \"should not unlock\" the handset. The remaining 11 percent did not offer an opinion. The exact questions posed to poll takers was not revealed, but it seems U.S. sentiment is, for the most part, in agreement with the DOJ.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Apple is not being asked to unlock the iPhone 5c, but rather provide a software workaround that bypasses a passcode attempt counter, thereby allowing FBI agents to conduct a brute force attack on the device. The company is not being asked to unlock a single phone, but rather supply a proof-of-concept tool capable of breaking a major facet of iOS encryption.\n\nThe FBI, as well as the White House, has stated on numerous occasions that the Apple-created forensic tool would only be used to crack Farook's iPhone 5c. On the other hand, security experts and Apple itself claim the creation of such a bypass inherently weakens iOS encryption, threatening millions of iOS devices.", "BARCELONA, Spain -- Several smaller phone makers are using this week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, to unveil new smartphones targeting the lower-end and mid-range markets.\n\nWhile Samsung got much of the attention for its new handsets and virtual-reality accessories, many smaller brands are trying to shine through as well.

He said that Internet.org, the company's effort to provide internet to the billions of people without access, has several facets, including satellites in Africa to provide internet access, as well as the solar-powered Aquila drone.\n\nInternet.org is an effort asking Facebook partners to package Facebook's apps with others and \"zero-rate\" them, giving people access to those apps without incurring data fees.\n\n\"We learned that every country is different,\" said Mr. Zuckerberg. \"Our goal is really just to help people get on the internet,\" he said, adding that Free Basics has given internet access to 19 million people globally.\n\nFacebook for some time now has been emphasizing developing countries. In October, it announced a new ad unit, Slideshow, that's meant to be served to people in developing countries who have slower 2G connections. Slideshow is essentially a series of stills of a marketer's choosing -- they can be photographs or stills from a video ad -- that are meant to render well when video can't.\n\nFacebook has come under criticism for offering zero-rated programs so that it can then serve ads to those users. But Mr. Zuckerberg balked at those who criticize the initiative, saying, \"People don't take me at face value that we just want to help people get on the internet.\"\n\nHe also touted video, which by all accounts, has been a boon for the company ad wise, and virtual reality. Mr. Zuckerberg made an appearance Sunday night at Samsung's conference announcement. (Samsung is also touting VR.) Mr. Zuckerberg said that as mobile operators improve their networks, more people will be able to adopt video, but that \"video isn't the end of the line,\" and he sees a future with much more VR. Facebook's Oculus VR headset is set to come out next month.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg also expressed his support for Apple in light of its issue with the U.S. Government, which blew up last week, as Apple refused as has refused to comply with a court order to help U.S. investigators unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack in December.\n\n\"I'm sympathetic with Apple,\" he said, adding that blocking encryption of \"requiring back doors\" is not effective in increasing security or \"the right thing to do.\"\n\nHe did, however, say that Facebook is helping prevent terrorism by removing people who promote it.", "At this year's Mobile World Congress, Samsung took the stage to show its latest vision in cutting-edge technology for Android smartphones. The mouthwatering devices each feature waterproofing, tons of space, and bigger batteries than ever before.\n\nRelated: Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S7\n\nWe know you may be itching to get one yourself, so here's our complete guide to pre-ordering your very own Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are expected to be at a number of retail stores soon too, including Target, Staples, Walmart, and others. Just as you'd expect with a flagship like the Samsung Galaxy line, it will make its way everywhere in the coming weeks, and with pre-orders beginning in just a matter of days, we'll likely see every store and carrier throwing promotions to grab customers and make sales.\n\nWhichever avenue you choose to pre-order, best of luck in deciding which of these top-notch gadgets ends up being right for you.", "LG wants you to play more. Presumably, play with your phone, going with all the interesting things that LG is touting its new G5 smartphone as being able to do. One big similarity to last year's model -- the removable battery -- is achieved in an extremely different way, opening up the door for LG to try some new and exciting things with its brand new flagship phone.\n\nThe Friends: Everything Is Modular\n\nThe big talking point about the G5 is the fact that it falls to pieces. But in a good way! On the side of the G5 at the lower edge of the bezel, there's a small recessed button. Push it, and the base of the phone -- from the lower edge of the screen downwards -- pops out, revealing a proprietary port and the G5's internal 2800mAh removable battery. Pull that, and the battery slides out, letting you replace it with a fully charged one; almost like recharging a rifle with a new magazine.\n\nThe battery being replaceable is a given -- it's great. But it's that accessory port that matters, because you can take the battery off the small piece that comes away from the G5's base, and instead attach something entirely different. That gives LG and its phone owners the ability to actually customise their phones in a way that noticeably impacts them, moreso than just a case or just a screen protector might.\n\nLG has plenty of different Friends that will plug into the modular port and that will hook up with the G5 more generally. A Bang & Olufsen-designed 24-bit hi-fi DAC and a camera grip module with zoom dial and shutter button and 1200mAh extra battery were both shown and demonstrated -- this tech works -- but it's up to LG and other partner manufacturers to work together to try new things and see what fits. A bigger battery would be the first of many different accessories that LG could sell alongside the G5.\n\nThe Hardware: Australia's First Snapdragon 820\n\nThe processing power inside the LG G5 is great, although is confident enough of its greatness that it doesn't really want you to pay attention to it -- there's more important things like Friends to talk about, right? But we care about power, and the G5 has a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core under the hood that is a first for Australia. Paired with 3GB of RAM, and LG's traditionally quite lightweight software stack on top of Android, this should mean a phone that is fast and consistently capable.\n\nBeing a new phone, it's great to see that LG has gone all-in in adopting USB Type-C where its chief competitor Samsung has fumbled. Although the modular design would have made the G5 easy to switch to Type-C anyway, it's on there right now and that means great things for fast charging, video output and accessories like docks and break-out modules like LG's own virtual reality headset for the G5, which weighs in at barely 100 grams and draws power from the USB port itself.\n\nThe Display: Smaller, Sharper, Always On\n\nLG has made the G5 a little smaller and more accessible than the G4 and G3's 5.5-inch size, and the new 2560\u00d71440 pixel panel is a 5.3-inch IPS quantum dot LCD that has a higher PPI than the G4, although it falls slightly short of Samsung's equal-resolution 5.1-inch display in the Galaxy S7. Being a unibody metal phone, too, means that the bezels are very slightly smaller than before and this makes the entire display look a little larger than that 5.3-inch figure might suggest to you.\n\nLike Samsung, LG has decided to innovate by creating an always-on display that only switches on a third of the LCD panel, saving significant power -- the company says it only uses 0.8 per cent of the battery per hour of usage. Sure, that's an extra 20 per cent battery drain over a day, but it's a convenience thing -- and you can, of course, just turn it off if you don't like it. Always-on displays are convenient for tracking notifications without powering up the rest of the phone, so they do pay for themselves in energy savings.\n\nThe Cameras: Three, Not Two, And Wider Angles\n\nThe LG G5's rear camera is actually two cameras -- one 16-megapixel sensor behind a lens with a relatively standard 78-degree field of view, and one 8-megapixel sensor with a 135-degree super-wide-angle lens. This is a little wider than the human eye, and it has me thinking that the G5 would actually make an extremely handy impromptu dashcam. In a quick usage session, I can see the main camera being far more useful for most of the time, but the 135 degree lens would be very handy for landscape shots.\n\nIt's certainly a different and more interesting approach to Samsung's Galaxy S7 lens and sensor improvements, but we're actually seeing the biggest difference in years between what are usually the two best and most compelling Android smartphones. And this is a great thing! If you have to make the decision, you can either go with the tried and tested Samsung, or experiment and potentially do some really cool and really extraordinary things with a new LG G5.\n\nHave you subscribed to Gizmodo Australia's email newsletter?

However, he said Facebook also understands the need to keep people safe, both online and in real life. (Facebook reportedly has had its own interaction with the feds when it comes to tracking terrorists using data available through the social network.)\n\n\"If we have opportunities to basically work with government folks to make sure there aren't terrorist attacks, then we're obviously going to take those opportunities,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And we feel a pretty strong responsibility to help make sure that society is safe, so we care about that. That's a big deal.\"\n\nZuckerberg spoke to a packed room in the final time slot of the first day of the mobile technology industry's biggest event. Here are a few of the other topics he touched on:\n\nA vision of virtual reality\n\nZuckerberg recounted a story about when he first learned to program computers: The then 11-year-old would sit in math class and scribble code in his notebook while drawing pictures of how the Internet might someday work beyond two-dimensional websites. Now, the technology is finally here, he said.\n\n\"There are two real things that we are focused on with VR,\" he said. \"One is this trend of giving people better and better ways to express everything that they care about and consume things that they care about in the world. Ten or 15 years ago, most of what we shared and consumed online was text, and then it was photos, especially when we got smartphones, ... and now it's becoming video.\"\n\nJust yesterday, while making a surprise appearance at Samsung's unveiling of its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones in Barcelona, Zuckerberg said people have spent more than 1 million hours in virtual reality using Samsung's Gear VR device. Facebook has its own social VR department to explore social components of virtual reality. He said people are always looking for more immersive ways to share their lives.\n\n\"When I took my first steps, my mom wrote down the date with a pen,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Text, right? My cousin, when her son took his first steps, she took a photo of it with a camera. My sister, when her son took his first steps, she took a video on a mobile camera. And what I hope to do is capture the whole scene, so I can remember it, and with a 360 camera, so even if my parents or my family aren't there, they will be able to just feel like they are.\"\n\nThe growth of live video\n\nFacebook has been increasingly touting the role mobile video plays on the platform. Zuckerberg said he sees live video -- a feature recently opened up to users other than celebrities and journalists -- as a way for people to share more of their lives than what appears in their personally curated feeds.\n\nPlatforms like Messenger, WhatsApp and Live Video are \"really powerful,\" he said, because they give people a more intimate experience. \"And it gives people a reason to just be [themselves],\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nInternet for all\n\nAsked about India's recent decision to ban Free Basics, Facebook's initiative to provide Internet access to parts of the country that don't have it, Zuckerberg acknowledged the setback. However, he said, \"Facebook isn't a company that hits a roadblock and just gives up.\" Instead, it's moving forward with other plans, such as launching a satellite and building a drone. The company founder said he is disappointed that some fail to take the initiative at face value or anything more than a moneymaker.\n\n\"Our goal, to the extent of any business goal at all, is to help people get on the Internet,\" he said.", "The sun has set on day one at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and despite a flurry of pre-show announcements, there was still plenty to see.\n\nYou can forget the Xperia Z, because Sony's back with a litter of three Xperia X phones at Mobile World Congress ... but you'll be hard pressed to tell them apart. The elegant, 5-inch Android phones all look nearly identical. The difference is mainly inside: Two have fingerprints sensors and are water resistant, plus all three have different chips. The exciting performance model is powered by a Snapdragon 820. They're all gorgeous, but unfortunately we have no idea when or even if they'll make it to the U.S.\n\nRelated: Samsung and LG war to win the weekend before MWC 2016\n\nLG has gone modular with the new G5. One of the first plug-in accessories is something many music-loving smartphone owners have been waiting for. It's called the Hi-Fi with B&O Play, and it's a powerful snap-in DAC and amplifier, designed with trusted high-end audio company Bang & Olufsen's help. It can play back high-res audio files the way they were really meant to be heard.\n\nGoogle and Lenovo continue to show off their exciting work together on Project Tango, this time taking us on an augmented reality tour through a Barcelona museum. We really got a feel for the potential behind this cool new technology, which completely maps out indoor spaces in 3D, while the augmented reality aspect informed us about the artwork and artifacts we were looking at. Expect to hear plenty more from these two companies regarding Project Tango throughout the year.", "Now that the impressive Samsung Galaxy S7 is official and coming on March 11th, potential buyers are weighing all of their options at the moment. And with good reason. With that in mind here we'll be taking a look at the Galaxy S7, and how it compares to the current Galaxy S6 it's set to soon replace.\n\nIn April, the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge were released and have been among the most popular smartphones over the past 10 months. On February 21st though, Samsung unveiled a similar yet highly improved Galaxy S7 and bigger Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nRead: Galaxy S7 Release Date Breakdown\n\nFor nearly an entire year the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 have been the best phones available, along with the Note 5. Not to mention the competition like the LG G4 or iPhone 6s. Many users are still picking up the Galaxy S6 right now, especially with heavy discounts, but with a Galaxy S7 release near some may want to wait. Here we'll be examining what both phones offer, and where Samsung improved.\n\nAs expected, many of the Galaxy S7 rumors that have been floating around since as far back as September and October were rather accurate. While there aren't four different models or a crazy 6-inch Galaxy S7 Plus option, Samsung delivered two stunning phones with different screen sizes for any and all consumers.\n\nWe did get two phones that look similar to last year but are vastly improved. From a similar design yet IP68 water resistant, micro-SD slots, a great new camera, and even a bigger 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge. Samsung really came through this year. Here's what you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S7, and why you shouldn't get the Galaxy S6 right now.\n\nOn Sunday Samsung silenced all the rumors and set the tone early for the Galaxy S7 release date. Making this one of the fastest releases from one generation to the next, and the fastest release after being announced in Samsung's history.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will be released in the United States and most regions around the globe on March 11th. This has been 100% confirmed. Select carriers outside the US are shipping early on the 8th, but those in the U.S. can expect it to arrive on March 11th from all major carriers, Best Buy, Target, Staples, Walmart and many other retail locations.\n\nRumors were all over the map regarding a release date. Some suggested March 4th, while others claimed April like last year. Evan Blass and our own sources were right, and the new phone will hit all shelves on March 11th.\n\nJust like we heard time and time again, the Galaxy S7 looks very similar to the Galaxy S6 from last year. There are a few very subtle changes, as well as a rounded back to make it easier to hold, and feel thinner in the hand. That said, it will be a very different phone that's better, faster, more powerful, has better battery life and more. Like Apple it may look the same, but it's actually a huge upgrade.\n\nThe overall look is nearly the same from the front. The Black model doesn't have silver accents on the fingerprint scanner or the earpiece speaker, but the silver and gold models do. Giving it a cleaner front face. The front camera is slightly bigger as it has a wide-angle 5 megapixel f/1.7 lens, but otherwise the entire device looks nearly identical.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S7 has the same all glass and aluminum design, camera on back, fingerprint scanner in the home button and more.\n\nSamsung kept the same 5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 Quad-HD S-AMOLED display for the Galaxy S7, and increased the Galaxy S7 Edge to 5.5-inches for those that want a bigger display. Leaks were all over regarding this, but now that's it's official we have all the details.\n\nEverything is nearly identical right down to the 3.5mm headphone jack, micro-USB charging port (not USB Type-C) and even the speaker. The Galaxy S7 is on the right in the image above.\n\nThere are three very important changes though, which we'll explain more below. The Galaxy S7 is IP68 dust and water resistant. It can be submerged in nearly 5ft of water for over 30 minutes with no problem. Samsung also added a bigger 3,000 mAh battery, and a 3,600 mAh battery in the Galaxy S7 Edge. Then last but certainly not last, Samsung heard the world's complaints, and returned the micro-SD slot. It's on top inside the SIM card tray. Now owners can add a 200GB micro-SD card full of photos, video and more.\n\nSo if the Galaxy S7 will look nearly the same as the Galaxy S6, and come in the same sizes, what makes it different and worth buying? All the technology and upgrades that took place. This phone is faster, more powerful, will last longer, takes better photos, should feel thinner in the hand thanks to a rounded design on back and more. Here are the numbers for those interested.\n\nGalaxy S7 Specs\n\nAs you can see above, the Samsung Galaxy S7 sounds pretty good. The Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM will make it faster, smoother, and perform great. Gaming, multi-tasking and more should all benefit from this, not to mention battery life. The micro-SD and battery were two things Samsung really needed to address, and they nailed them both.\n\nGalaxy S6 Specs\n\nAs you can see, there are multiple differences. The biggest one being the return of the micro-SD card, but that isn't all. The Galaxy S7 will finally have a big battery to compete with the other phones on the market. The Galaxy S6 had a tiny 2,550 mAh battery, and even the 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 5 is only 3,000 mAh. So having that same big battery on a smaller and more efficient Galaxy S7 with Android 6.0 should be very promising.\n\nFor Samsung to improve nearly every aspect, return the micro-SD slot, add IP68 water and dust resistance, and make the camera better all in roughly the same device, was quite a task. Users should be rather excited about the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nRumors of a pressure-sensitive display like Apple's 3D Touch or a Retina Scanner turned out to be false, but the Galaxy S7 has plenty already to make it a worthy successor to last years Galaxy S6.\n\nYes, the Galaxy S7 camera is only 12 megapixels, compared to the 16 megapixel camera everyone raved about and loved in the Galaxy S6. However, Samsung's new camera has some impressive technology that could make it the best camera inside any smartphone ever released.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 features the first \"Dual Pixel\" camera sensor for a smartphone. It has a huge 1.4 or 1.5um pixel size, and a blazing fast f/1.7 aperture that could potentially rival some DSLR cameras. It's that good. The phone uses all of the pixels to have an extremely fast and accurate auto-focus, image stabilization for clear photos, and a huge 12 Dual Pixel sensor that can capture more light faster than most smartphone cameras available today.\n\nSamsung actually claims it captures nearly 95% more light than other competing smartphone cameras, and does it faster. Meaning stunning photos, great indoor or low light photography, and image stabilization to cap it all off for amazing videos in 4k and more.\n\nWe haven't had a chance to fully test out the new Galaxy S7 camera yet, but with Samsung boldly saying it blows away the iPhone 6s Plus camera in every aspect, it should be rather impressive once it arrives on March 11th.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints last year about the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge was battery life. For a big powerful phone Samsung only added a small 2,550 mAh battery. Even the Galaxy S5 from 2014 had a bigger 2,800 mAh battery inside. This was unacceptable, and the Galaxy S6 didn't last nearly long enough.\n\nAs we said above, Samsung completely fixed that too this year. The screen, new Snapdragon 820 processor, Android 6.0 and more are all more efficient, so battery life should be much improved. Add in the fact that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 now have a 3,000 and 3,600 mAh battery, this phone should last far longer than the model last year.\n\nWe still have Quick Charging, which recharges the phone from 0-50% in less than 20 minutes, and fully recharges in about 70-80 minutes. Samsung also employed a similar Fast Wireless Charging technology as the Galaxy Note 5. Meaning these phones are better in every way, yet will last longer and recharge faster. Want one yet?\n\nOf course the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will be released on all major carriers, but the color and storage options are different this year. They only have a 32GB model (but it has a micro-SD slot) and the Galaxy S7 comes in Black or Gold. Then the Galaxy S7 Edge comes in Black, Gold or Silver. That's it.\n\nRead: Galaxy S7 Pre-Order Date & Time\n\nAgain, all carriers will release the Galaxy S7 on March 11th. The Galaxy S6 is still available, and deals may start to surface along with heavy discounts. If you don't need the latest and greatest, the S6 is still a wonderful smartphone worth considering.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 was $199 with a new 2-year contract and $599 outright for the 32GB model from most carriers, then went up with more storage or the Edge curved screen model. The Galaxy S7 has a little more technology inside, and costs a little more. That said, carriers have some good pricing plans in place. It looks like the Galaxy S7 costs around $680 (give or take a little) and the Galaxy S7 Edge is $760 or more. Sprint is asking the least, while AT&T is cheaper on a month-to-month basis.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 Edge is only a few dollars more per month from each carrier, which ends up putting the total price a little over $750 for Samsung's new 5.5-inch flagship water-resistant smartphone.\n\nAll said and done the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge look to be a worthy successor to the Galaxy S6. The looks might be rather similar, but these are completely different phones on the inside. Stay tuned for more details, video, and the release date come March 11th.", "Samsung aimed to gather the best features of Galaxies past for their S7 line. That included features missing from the S6 like water resistance and a microSD slot, but the company also took the improved design from the S6 line and made it even better. Check out the photos above to see every angle of the sleek new hardware and look here for a run-down of everything that's new.\n\nYou'll be sure to notice the improved design of the larger S7 edge as soon as you pick one up. The sharp, flat back of the S6 edge has lost its unpleasantness and has been replaced with lightly curved edges that feels exceptionally more comfortable in your hand.\n\nOther than the new dual-SIM microSD slot (which sits in the same positioning) the ports remain unchanged, a major feat given the top-of-the-line IP68 water resistance. On that note, Samsung confirmed to me that the phone should be able to withstand a half hour of submersion at about five feet of depth. This means it'll be no problem to take an S7 into the shower or pool without worrying for your device's life.\n\nThe devices will be available March 11, with pre-orders beginning tomorrow morning at 8:00AM EST.", "The best TVs are still very pricy, but the costs are coming down.\n\nIf there's one rule in the TV world right now, it's that OLED is king. Take the inky black levels of the best plasma televisions, mix in super wide viewing angles, and put it all in a gorgeously thin panel and you've got your typical OLED TV.\n\nUnfortunately, like any new technology, OLED displays are more expensive than the LCDs that they're attempting to replace. While the common wisdom has been that OLEDs will get cheaper eventually, \"eventually\" will be here sooner than you think.\n\nWhen Will OLED TVs Come Down in Price?\n\nSo OLED is great, and it's getting cheaper -- but when will it be cheap? What's the forecast, and when can regular people expect to be able to afford one?\n\nWell, the answer is that OLED prices are already falling. We recently took a look at LG's new 55EG9100, a 55-inch 1080p OLED TV that will start at $1,999.99.\n\nWe know: that's still crazy expensive for most people. You can get a 55-inch 1080p LCD TV for around $600 and 4K LCD TVs aren't much more. But don't forget that the LG 55EG9100 vastly outperforms any other 1080p TV under $2,000. It's that good.\n\nMost encouragingly, $2,000 is only the starting price. Last year the LG 55EC9300 (which is essentially the same TV) started around $3,400 but dropped to about $1,700 by the end of last year. If the EG9100 enjoys a similar price drop, anyone looking for a truly affordable OLED TV will be in business later this year.\n\nBut Why Are OLED TVs So Expensive?\n\nThe main reason that OLED TVs are so expensive is that they OLED is a young technology, and manufacturing OLED TVs is difficult. This is especially true of OLED panels large enough to be used in consumer TVs, which only LG Display currently makes. Samsung and Sony have both made OLED and AMOLED displays in the past, but they're usually smaller and used in things like phones.\n\nPretend you are starting a pizza shop, but your oven keeps burning them. If you are burning 80% of your pizzas, you need to sell the good ones at a high enough price to make up for all the waste. Burn fewer pizzas and you can drop your prices.\n\nWhile that sounds extreme, early OLED manufacturing was just that inefficient. Jerry Kang, a display analyst at market research firm IHS, says the yields on OLED TVs -- especially 1080p models -- has improved dramatically:\n\nIn 2013 the oxide TFT process used to make the first OLED panels for Full HD (FHD) TV displays was a new technology, and initially the yield rate was only 10%. Panel makers have since overcome the early issues, and OLED yield rates for FHD are now 90%.\n\nUltra HD (UHD) panels were only introduced at the end of 2014, and the yield rate was also extremely low at that time (5% to 10%)...Panel makers have been working on these problems, and the yield rate has since risen to 50%.\u200b\n\nSo What's Next For OLED TVs?\n\nTaking a look at LG's 2016 TV lineup and it's clear that OLED is still its top priority. But with 4K resolution, high dynamic range, and quantum dot all hitting the market this year, LG's got to do more than just improve on OLED manufacturing yields.\n\nLG's flagship G6 series is easily the most impressive OLED TV we've seen yet, but all these new features are going to keep the price pretty high -- though it's not much more than the top TVs from Samsung and Sony.\n\nOLED TVs will be affordable sooner than you'd think.\n\nAnother positive sign? We're seeing more companies buying OLED panels from LG to put in their TVs. For example, TV nerds lost their minds last year when it was announced that Panasonic would debut its first OLED TV, the flagship CZ950. The OLED panel in that TV is undoubtedly sourced from LG Display, signaling that LG is confident enough to begin taking outside orders.\n\nThe end result? OLED TVs will be affordable sooner than you'd think. They still have a long way to go to match LCD TV prices, but if you're a fan of OLEDs there's no doubt that things are heading in the right direction.\n\nRelated Video", "Reddit Email Print Reprint\n\nConsumers who frequent Amazon (AMZN - Get Report) and don't have a Prime membership have probably gotten used to the company's free shipping with an order of $35 or more. Well, that's about to change.\n\nAmazon is doing its best to persuade customers to sign up for Amazon Prime, its $99 per year service that includes free two-day shipping on millions of items, streaming music and video, free photo storage in the cloud and other perks. But as the company raises its minimum order from $35 to $49 to quality for free shipping, it's perhaps giving customers one more subtle reminder that it wants them to buy in.\n\nOr maybe it's not so subtle. Amazon has tried to lure in customers with its perks, which for a little over $8 a month isn't too shabby. And it's mostly worked, as Prime memberships in the U.S. grew 47% in 2015. The company's latest move is doing just the opposite: Instead of showing customers what they're gaining by being Prime, its showing them exactly what they're missing by being non-Prime.\n\nThe play makes sense when you consider that Amazon hasn't raised its free shipping threshold since 2013, and that shipping costs are one its largest expenses, accounting for $1.8 billion last year, up 37% year-over-year.\n\nMust Read: Fitbit Crashes Near 52-Week Low as Guidance Comes In Weak\n\nShares of Amazon closed at $559.50 on Monday, up 4.6%.\n\nWish your smartphone was more adaptable?

The phone will also power the LG 360 VR headset, which allows customers to view VR content with compatible apps.\n\nSo far, major smartphone manufacturers haven't been able to execute on this swappable concept. The unit will roll out later this spring, but pricing is not yet available.\n\nLG wasn't the only smartphone maker showing off new devices at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung introduced its latest lineup, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.\n\nThe phones boasts improved cameras, faster processors and an improved battery. Aside from these more common annual improvements though, the phones aren't all that much different, which could be somewhat of a problem for Samsung.\n\nSamsung is stuck in the position where they're still too expensive vs. low-end models, yet get passed over for Apple's (AAPL - Get Report) iPhone by many premium-end customers.\n\nWith that being said, Samsung is rolling out other products, hoping to capitalize on the ecosystem of its devices. The company is launching the Gear VR virtual reality headset and the Gear 360 360-degree camera.\n\nEarlier, TheStreet's Chris Ciaccia took a closer look at pricing, writing: \"The phones will be available for pre-order starting tomorrow, Feb. 23, and pricing varies differently depending upon the carrier. According to the tech website BGR, pricing for the S7 will be $28 a month on Verizon, $23.17 on AT&T, $27.91 on T-Mobile and $27.09 from Sprint. On the S7 Edge, pricing will be $33 (Verizon), $26.50 (AT&T), $32.50 (T-Mobile) and $31.25 (Spring) on the four carriers. All the contracts are for 24 months, except for AT&T's, which are for 30 months.\"\n\nOnly time will tell on whether the smartphone maker is able to take back market share and use its ecosystem to boost sales. And it will surely make Apple's likely iPhone launch in September that much more interesting.\n\nIn a recent survey, 51% of voters say Apple should unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook, compared to just 38% who disagreed, (11% didn't know).\n\nFor those of you unaware, the U.S. government has a court order demanding the company to unlock the phone for the FBI. Apple has already refused, with CEO Tim Cook siding with his customers' privacy and worry about the type of precedent this could set going forward.\n\nYou can read Cook's letter, here.\n\nSo far, this isn't your typical company-in-the-headlines event, where after a day or two, things simmer down and eventually dissipate. Apple's tough stance has drawn the support of other tech titans, like Facebook (FB - Get Report) , Twitter (TWTR - Get Report) and Google (GOOGL - Get Report) , along with several big-name players in the space as well, like Mark Cuban and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIndeed, there is a concern for precedent going forward, as it's unlikely that Apple would have to unlock just this one iPhone and go back about its business as if nothing had ever happened.\n\nIn a new customer letter, Apple stated that the government had requested them to build a new operating system, that would allow them to hack the iPhone in question. While Apple acknowledged that this tactic is indeed possible, \"the only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn't abused and doesn't fall into the wrong hands is to never create it.\"\n\nThe company went on to explain: \"the digital world is very different from the physical world. In the physical world you can destroy something and it's gone. But in the digital world, the technique, once created, could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\" And even with the company doing its best to protect this asset, it's susceptible to constant bombardment from hackers. As the company said, in the wrong hands, it could be quite dangerous.\n\nCook's concerns for what precedents would be set going forward seems justified, as Apple stated, \"Law enforcement agents around the country have already said they have hundreds of iPhones they want Apple to unlock if the FBI wins this case.\"\n\nThe drama in this one seems far from over.\n\nShares of Apple closed at $96.88 on Monday, up 0.87%.\n\nThis article is commentary by an independent contributor.

What makes our MateBook unique are are its compatibility and huge variety of functions,\" said Glory Zhang, chief marketing officer of Huawei Consumer Business.\n\nAlthough MateBook is being launched later than other comparable tablets, Zhang said it is no cause for concern because Huawei's strategy is to bring to market products once the technology involved can best satisfy consumer needs.\n\n\"We are not so concerned about being the first in a market. For example, when we launched our smartphone, the market was already filled with many smartphone makers, but our high quality allowed us to win market share.\"\n\n\"We have made good use of cutting edge technologies that we developed for our smartphone in our MateBook, which gives us a competitive strength,\" Zhang says.\n\nHuawei, founded in Shenzhen in 1987, has three core business areas. Its carrier business provides telecommunications services to operators like O2 and Telefonica, and it provides telecommunications services to corporate clients. Its third business area is consumer products.\n\nIn recent years its consumer business has picked up and has become a key factor in helping build the firm's brand across international markets. Its core products include the Huawei smartphone and Huawei Watch.\n\nHuawei is now the third-biggest player in the smartphone market after Apple and Samsung, and shipped 108 million smartphones in 2015, which represents a 44 percent increase in sales compared to 2014.\n\nNow Huawei is looking to make a major play in the tablet sector. Globally, tablet shipments fell 13.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2015, while shipments for detachable tablets reached an all-time high of 8.1 million devices, more than double from the same period in 2014, according to the research firm International Data Corporation.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook is being launched alongside the MatePen, which is used to write and draw on the MateBook. It has high sensitivity, can support graphics and mathematic functions and can be used as a laser pointer for delivering presentations.\n\nThe MateBook also has a one-touch unlocking system, which Huawei says is the fastest fingerprint recognition technology in the industry. Its technology supports 360 degrees sensitive identification, which leads to fewer identification failures than competitor technology."]}, "BASF": {"2016-02-19": ["AkzoNobel announced it has made an offer to acquire BASF's Industrial Coatings business for \u20ac475 million ($528 million USD).\n\nThe transaction would include technologies, patents and trademarks, as well as securing supply to customers worldwide.

Snow chains made from plastic, for tires, are usually to be found and sold by some Chinese stores, but an European company says the idea can be trustworthy, as even at low temperatures plastic can efficiently substitute metal. The French textile and rubber company Joubert Productions has put on the market such chains, whose links are made entirely from Elastollan, a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) produced by BASF, the largest chemical producer in the world. The company says the material meets the European safety standards, making it abrasion resistant, flexible at low temperatures, and resistant to loose chippings and road salt.\n\nIn this type of chains, the conventional metal mesh is replaced by two Elastollan grades of different colors that chemically adhere to one another in the injection-molding process, and so do not have to be additionally assembled. The black Elastollan with a harder setting is claimed to have very good mechanical properties along with extra flexibility at low temperatures, while the red material is more flexible and easy flowing. As the plastic links are much lighter than the conventional metal mesh, the snow chains are easy to handle and quick to remove. Therefore, they are lighter and easier to fit and supposedly cheaper, but would you trust the idea and test them for yourself?", "The report \"Oilfield Scale Inhibitor Market by Type (Phosphonates, Carboxylate/Acrylic, Sulfonates, and Others), and by Region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and South America) - Global Forecast to 2020\", published by MarketsandMarkets, The global market is projected to reach USD 697.5 Million by 2020 from the estimated USD 509.4 Million in 2014, at a CAGR of 5.40% between 2015 and 2020.\n\nRising demand for scale inhibitors from the oil & gas industry as well as demand for biodegradable scale inhibitors are some of the main factors driving the oilfield scale inhibitor market.\n\nEarly buyers will receive 10% customization on this reports.\n\nCarboxylate/acrylic are the most common type of oilfield scale inhibitor\n\nAmong the various types of scale inhibitors, the carboxylate/acrylate type holds the largest share in the oilfield scale inhibitor market.

(NPC), has told reporters in Iran that her firm is in negotiations with BASF to construct a major petrochemical facility in southern Iran. The German company may invest $4 billion in the project, according to reports from Iran. BASF declines to comment.\n\nThe deal, if it goes through, would be one of a series of tie ups between Iranian chemical firms and multinational chemical and engineering companies. NPC has a goal of producing petrochemicals worth $70 billion per year within 20 years. To realize this plan, the state-owned firm is seeking foreign investment of between $7 billion and $10 billion over the next decade.\n\nInvestment agreements are emerging now because years of international sanctions imposed upon Iran in response to its nuclear technology program are due to be lifted next month. Iran's chemical industry has access to large reserves of both oil and natural gas but has been hobbled by lack of technology and investment.\n\nSpeaking in December, Hamid Reza Rostami, NPC's director for planning affairs, said a company like BASF would bring capital, technology, management, and a guaranteed market for products. BASF's Chairman Kurt Bock is understood to have visited Iran as part of a delegation in the summer of 2015.\n\nAccording to reports from Iranian news organizations, BASF would have a 60% stake in the project, which would be located in the Parsian Special Industrial Zone in Assaluyeh.

This is due, in part, to Iowa's impressive agricultural production in corn, soybeans, livestock, dairy, and poultry, but it is also due to the fact that Iowan's are, for the most part, proud of agriculture. It is part of their culture, their politics, their heritage, and their modern day identity. Agricultural issues are written about in their newspapers, broadcast on their local TV stations, and consume a good deal of their radio broadcast time. While other states can claim all of these as well, Iowa is generally acknowledged as the leader. Yet, Iowa may have some competition.\n\nWhen Dow and DuPont decided to merge into a single behemoth corporate entity, they announced they would spin off their two agricultural divisions into one all ag company. Basically, this would mean putting DuPont Pioneer together with Dow AgroSciences to form a global, $18 billion heavyweight to compete with the likes of Monsanto, Syngenta, BASF, and Bayer. The conventional thinking was that this new major ag firm would be located in Iowa, since Pioneer already had its headquarters there. But, that is not how things turned out.\n\nWhile Iowa officials launched a high profile campaign to land the headquarters of the yet to be named entity, Indiana put together a low key, full court press to challenge Iowa. According to those close to the negotiations, when Dow/DuPont top execs came to Indiana they had their minds pretty much made up that things were going to Iowa. Yet, as one of the members of the Hoosier team said, \"We knocked their socks off.\" A combination of a pro-business and pro-agriculture atmosphere impressed the top brass. In the end, it was decided to have two Global Business Centers, one in Iowa and the other in Indiana.\n\nFor the past decade, Indiana has been cultivating a climate that is supportive of agriculture. Not only is it supportive of agriculture within the state, but also supportive of attracting agricultural investment from outside the state. The first round came with the renewable fuels boom. Late to the game and, well behind Iowa, Indiana made up ground quickly by attracting billions of dollars to build new ethanol and biodiesel plants in the state. In recent years, the focus has shifted to attracting food processing plants. When Governor Pence ran for his first term, the foundation of his agricultural policy was innovation in agriculture. He had the vision to make Indiana a center of research and innovation for agriculture and food production. It is this policy that enabled the Hoosier State to put together the kind of package that was able to compete with Iowa and land this major global agricultural business.\n\nIndiana is gaining a reputation as a major ag player in other areas. As a specialist in swine genetics, Whiteshire Hamroc, based in Fort Wayne, was recently featured in Bloomberg Business news. The article focused on the growth of the animal genetics industry, especially in developing countries where demand for meat is growing. Indiana-based Beck's Hybrids has been making news as it expands into the Western Corn Belt; and Jiff Simmons, President of Elanco, is recognized as an international authority of innovation and food sustainability.\n\nWhere Indiana is still lacking is getting the majority of Hoosiers to understand that they live in a key agricultural state. Most of Indiana's residents identify with motorsports, basketball, and manufacturing. Many residents of even our smaller communities see farming as a source of possible pollution rather than a source of jobs and local economic activity. More work needs to be done to get more of the 6.2 million Hoosiers on the Ag bandwagon.\n\nIndiana is celebrating its Bicentennial this year. During this celebration, there will be a lot of talk about how agriculture is part of the Hoosier heritage and of the role it played in the formation of the state and its culture. But, what also needs to be showcased is how agriculture is part of the Indiana future. Biotechnology, life sciences, food production, and renewable energy will all see significant growth and innovation in the next 100 years. If these become the centerpiece of the Hoosier economy and culture, look out Iowa!", "In the summer of 2012, just after Naadam, I had the opportunity to meet an extraordinary Thai person. It was Vikrom Kromadit, who was about to leave Mongolia after traveling the country for more than a month with his team shooting a documentary on Mongolia's nature and society.\n\nHe owns an industrial park in Chonburi Province, Thailand. The industrial park, which is located in a free trade zone, is a place where hundreds of international companies operate and produce machinery and equipment, employing Thai people.\n\nThe industrial park is called Amata and is found 70 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. Amata currently has 300,000 people working there, and it is a smart city that recycles and reuses their water and waste.\n\nVikrom established two other industrial parks, one in his home country and another in Vietnam. The Amata industrial park, which has an area of 150 square kilometers, has more than 1,000 factories, including Toyota Motor, BMW, Nestle, BASF, Hitachi, Sony, PepsiCo, Robert Bosch, POSCO, Mitsubishi Electric, and Bridgestone. Their total sales have reached 40 billion USD, which equals 10 percent of Thailand's economy.\n\nTo mark the 40th anniversary of his company, Kun (a term of respect in Thai) Vikrom accomplished one of his dreams and had a cultural Amata Castle built. I have just returned from attending the opening ceremony of the castle.\n\nSixty-year-old Vikrom is one of Thailand's richest citizens. He is energetic and humble, and has earned the respect of the Thai people. Having been born as the eldest son of a sugar cane farmer, Vikrom has overcome many challenges in his life, including instability and poverty in his family.\n\nHis book \"Be a Better Man\" tells everything about his life and has been translated into many languages, including Mongolian. More than one million copies were sold in Thailand, and the book was recently published in Mongolia after S.Ider did the translation.\n\nThe book was even turned into a drama series in Thailand. Having read Vikrom's book, seeing what he has created, meeting him several times, and interviewing him on the Defacto program, I have tried to show how an individual can achieve the peak of success and what can be done afterwards.\n\nTHE FARMER WHO BECAME A BILLIONAIRE\n\nVikrom, who is the eldest son in his family of 23 brothers and sisters (including stepbrothers and stepsisters), started his business career by selling roasted peanuts when he was five years old. At the age of eight, he owned a shop and had 500 USD in his bank account.\n\nLater on, Vikrom graduated from National Taiwan University in mechanical engineering with a scholarship granted by the Taiwanese government. When he returned to his home country, he established the Amata Corporation in 1975 to conduct trade.\n\nVikrom tried out many different things, such as trading (gold, silver, jade, fruit, fish, and more) and production (paper, equipment, and fertilizers), and had many failures after acquiring loans and facing risks. However, he never gave up.\n\nSince his early childhood, Vikrom always assumed all responsibility and led his brothers and sisters by example.\n\nWhen speaking about the factors that led him to success, Kun Vikrom pointed out that the most important things were trusting in the truth, being genuine, treating everyone fairly, and doing business with vision and taking into account the global market.\n\nEven though he had a debt of one billion USD in 1997 due to the economic crisis in Asia, he paid it back with bank loans.\n\nThe reason that the banks trusted him and granted huge loans is that he always spoke the truth, kept track of everything with the greatest accuracy, and worked hard every single day.\n\nVikrom believes in reality, not in luck. Everything, including business, has a cause. In order to achieve business success, there must be a large, capable market first. Afterwards, a good factory is required to produce high quality goods.\n\nYour products should be high quality and affordable. Finally, post-sale service must be great in order to meet the demands of your customers fully. Vikrom likes to say that this is why Bill Gates and his Microsoft brand are so famous and successful.\n\nFIX YOURSELF FIRST, THEN YOUR HOME, AND YOUR SOCIETY AFTERWARDS\n\nKun Vikrom currently works as Chairman of the Amata Foundation. Forbes magazine included him in their 48 Heroes of Philanthropy list in 2014.\n\nThe Amata Foundation awards 144,000 USD (5 million THB) to the winners of their art and sculpture competitions, and 33,000 USD (1 million THB) to a recognized senior writer. In order to encourage others, the foundation distributed 300,000 copies of Vikrom's book to schools and prisons throughout the country.\n\nVikrom currently writes books and hosts a radio program called \"CEO Vision\" to tell the younger generation about having their own purpose and about the ordinary life of a monk (he has experience from being a monk).\n\nAlso, Vikrom makes a television show called \"Asia Rising\", and presents his experience of traveling more than 40,000 kilometers in seven months through China, Myanmar, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia.\n\nDuring his Defacto interview with me, Vikrom said that more than half of the world's population lives in Asia. Asia is the place where the majority of cash in the world flows. Even though Asia has become the center of the global economy, we have yet to form a huge, integrated market like Europe has.\n\nHe emphasized that Asians must strengthen their cultural diplomacy in order to enhance discussions and understand each other better.\n\nVikrom noted, \"Starting from the first day of 2016, Asian countries set up the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and created a market of 2.6 trillion USD. This is an important start. The next step would be the upcoming negotiations with the Pacific countries.\"\n\nVikrom promotes the importance of education and knowledge among the younger generation, and encourages his brothers and sisters to go to school, rewarding them more when they get good grades.\n\nWhat he also teaches his siblings is that they should always take care of their family members and help the poor.\n\nVikrom also reminds us that the most important thing is to understand that it is a citizen's duty to fix and improve the livelihood of themselves and the society they are living in. He is a leader who always exemplifies what he says. It is the reason why he has achieved his success.\n\nVikrom says, \"Every day I have done my best to make money and become richer. Every dollar I make brings prosperity and economic freedom to me, to every employee at the Amata industrial park, and to my country.\"\n\nIt looks as if not everyone can achieve business success and become a philanthropist afterwards. The life of Kun Vikrom, his deeds, and what he says shows us that those who can give to others fully understand what happiness in life is.\n\nThey say that a Hollywood film that is based on his life story, full of ups and downs, will be made soon. Everyone should try to be a better man."]}, "Apple": {"2016-02-19": ["The Apple ID passcode for the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone was changed less than 24 hours after authorities took possession of the device, a senior Apple executive said today.\n\nAnd Apple could have recovered information from the phone had the Apple ID passcode not been changed, Apple said.\n\nIf the phone was taken to a location where it recognized the Wi-Fi network, such as the San Bernardino shooters' home, it could have been backed up to the cloud, Apple suggested.\n\nBut it is not entirely clear from Apple's court filing that the phone was in the hands of the authorities when the change was made.\n\nThe filing states \"the owner, in an attempt to gain access to some information in the hours after the attack, was able to reset the password remotely, but that had the effect of eliminating the possibility of an auto-backup.\"\n\nThe government got a warrant to search the car and get the phone in the early morning hours of Dec. 3, 2015, at 2:27 a.m. -- the day after the attack.\n\nThe attempt to reset the password could have been an attempt to use the Find My iPhone feature to locate it, sources noted.\n\nThe phone was in possession of federal investigators at the time of the remote passcode was reset, a federal official confirmed to ABC News.\n\nThe development comes as the Justice Department is pushing forward with its legal fight against Apple, urging a federal judge to compel the tech giant to help the FBI crack open a cellphone left behind by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters.\n\nSyed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, launched a deadly assault on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 of Farook's coworkers at a holiday party.\n\nProsecutors said Farook's device could be encrypted to the point that its content would be \"permanently inaccessible,\" and, \"Apple has the exclusive technical means which would assist the government in completing its search.\"\n\nAfter the court order, Apple quickly vowed to challenge the decision.\n\n\"The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement to customers Tuesday night. \"[T]his order ... has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\"\n\n\"The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on [the shooter's] iPhone,\" Cook added. \"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.\"\n\nIn addition, all of the personal and sensitive information on customers' phones \"needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission,\" Cook wrote.\n\nIf the battle between the FBI and Apple continues, it's a matter that could work its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "LOS ANGELES, Calif. - An Oregon man who accessed hundreds of email accounts and stole explicit photos of celebrities pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony hacking charge in Los Angeles.\n\nAndrew Helton of Astoria, Oregon, faces up to five years in prison after pleading guilty to stealing nude or explicit photos from 13 people, including some unidentified celebrities.\n\nHundreds of stolen nude images of stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis have been posted online in recent years.\n\nFBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller says Helton's is a separate case and that none of the images he stole are believed to have leaked online.\n\nHelton's attorney Shanon L.

The Hainan-based global conglomerate will acquire Ingram for $38.90 per share, with an overall value of around $6 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, barring all stockholder and regulatory approvals.\n\nWhile Tianjin Tianhai ultimately rolls up into the larger HNA Group, Ingram Micro operations are expected to continue running without any major disruption or changes. Ultimately, Ingram Micro will remain headquartered in Irvine, CA with the current executive staff continuing to preside over the distribution business.\n\nHNA Group as a whole has many investments and sectors to their business including transportation, logistics, financial services, and tourism. The acquisition of such a large distribution business adds to HNA's $90 billion in assets and specifically to their logistics portfolio as Ingram Micro delivers supply chain solutions and services. Ingram's broad global presence, especially in emerging markets, was also likely a draw for the Chinese company.\n\nIngram Micro stock has been directly affected as well from the merger with stocks growing over 20 percent after the announcement of the acquisition. The news in general caught the distribution channel by surprise with many shocked to hear the news. Ingram's reach is obvious broad with manufacturer partners that include Cisco, HP, IBM, Apple, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Samsung.\n\nIngram Micro's CEO, Alain Moni\u00e9 said of the merger, \"Our agreement to join HNA Group delivers near-term and compelling cash value to our stockholders and we expect it to provide exciting new opportunities for our vendors, customers and associates. Innovation, new services introduction, brand management and ensuring the stability and continuity of the businesses joining their enterprise are fundamental to HNA Group's overall strategy.

In part, that's because no can can figure out how to resolve the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, during a campaign stop in South Carolina, Republican Donald Trump called on consumers to boycott Apple, until the company complies with the court order to to come up a way to bypass the iPhone's encryption.\n\nLawmakers Picking Sides\n\nSome lawmakers, most notably Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have taken sides.\n\n\"Apple chose to protect a dead ISIS terrorist's privacy over the security of the American people,\" Cotton said in a statement, adding that \"legislation is likely the only way to resolve this issue.\"\n\nCalifornia Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has also shifted into the pro-legislation category. Earlier this month Schiff was quoted as saying a legislative solution to the issue was not \"feasible or even desirable.\" On Wednesday, Schiff issued a statement that \"these complex issues will ultimately need to be resolved by Congress, the Administration and industry, rather than the courts alone, since they involve important matters of public policy.\"\n\nBut Schiff has not offered a specific course of action, adding, \"We are far from any consensus.\"\n\nThe chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina, has written that \"Apple needs to comply with the court's order.\"\n\nBurr and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, California's Dianne Feinstein, have had ongoing discussions about legislation to force tech companies to decrypt their devices if ordered to do so by a court. A spokeswoman for Burr, however, said there is no draft bill yet, and that the senator was working \"on his own schedule\" on the proposal.\n\nIndependent Sen. Angus King of Maine, another member of the intelligence panel, told NPR's Morning Edition Friday that \"this is a really tough issue\" and that he could \"argue it either way.\" King said that to decide it in this case \"is I think the wrong approach. There is an old saying in law school: 'Hard cases make bad law.' \"\n\nKing was critical of the Obama administration for not proposing legislation to address the encryption issue, saying its something the FBI has \"been sounding alarms about ... for more than a year.\"\n\nOne possible path forward for lawmakers is that Washington staple, the blue ribbon commission. In fact, House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul of Texas and Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia have proposed just such a panel, a \"national commission on security and technology challenges in the digital age.\"\n\nIt would be comprised of \"a body of experts representing all of the interests at stake so we can evaluate and improved America's security posture as technology-and our adversaries-evolve.\" The two wrote the panel would be charged with \"developing a range of actionable recommendations that can protect privacy and public safety.\"\n\nPresidential Candidates Grappling With Issue\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail there is a similarly wide range of views and lack of consensus about how to address the encryption-national security argument.\n\nOn one side is Trump's call for an Apple boycott, something he told his supporters at a rally \"just occurred to me.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio called it \"a tough issue,\" but that he hoped Apple would comply with the order, adding, \"Ultimately I think being a good corporate citizen is important.\"\n\nAt a town hall meeting on MSNBC Thursday night, the two Democratic candidates also weighed in. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, asked who's side he was on, Apple or the FBI's, responded \"both.\"\n\nSanders said, \"All of us would be very dismayed if we learned that we could've picked up information about a potential terrorist act and we didn't do that. People would not feel good about this.\"\n\nBut Sanders added, \"There has got to be a balance.\" Calling himself \"a very strong civil libertarian,\" Sanders says he believes \"we can fight terrorism without undermining our constitutional rights and our privacy rights.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton position was also nuanced. She called it \"a very hard dilemma,\" that's \"going to have lots of ramifications. But I see both sides. And I think most citizens see both sides.\"\n\nClinton said \"there's got to be some way on a very specific basis we could try to help get information around crimes and terrorism.\"\n\nBut so far, no one on either side of the issue has figured what that way is.", "London's FTSE 100 index of top companies and Paris' CAC 40 both shed 0.4 percent at the close while the Frankfurt DAX fell 0.8 percent.\n\nGlobal markets sagged Friday but still turned in one of the strongest weeks of 2016 despite worries about economic growth and weak commodity prices.\n\nChina's intervention to support the yen and scare off devaluation speculators, and a deal struck to possibly avert Britain's pullout from the European Union, reduced some of the risks that had dogged markets for weeks.\n\nBut there was still turbulence in the oil market, with prices falling at the end of the week amid doubts over a possible deal between Russia and key OPEC producers to ease the market glut.\n\nUS stocks closed lower Friday but racked up their best week of the year, with the S&P 500 climbing 2.8 percent.\n\nLondon's FTSE index gained 4.3 percent in the week; Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 6.8 percent; and the Shanghai Composite rose 3.5 percent after reopening Monday following a week-long Lunar New Year break.\n\nBut for Friday alone, European shares were lower as traders waited to see if British Prime Minister David Cameron could strike a deal with his EU counterparts that would give Britain some breaks to encourage it to remain in the 28-country European Union.\n\nLondon's FTSE 100 index of top companies and Paris' CAC 40 both shed 0.4 percent at the close while the Frankfurt DAX fell 0.8 percent.\n\nA deal was reached late Friday, after the markets closed, giving a slight boost to the euro and the pound against the US greenback.

The U.S. government is overstepping the boundaries of the law, the official said.\n\nApple was responding to a court filing earlier on Friday from prosecutors, who asked a judge to compel Apple to cooperate in its probe and create software to access the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who died in a shootout with law enforcement after a terror attack in California that killed 14 people. Earlier this week, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that obeying an order and helping to unlock the phone would create a \"back door\" to its devices. Apple has one week to respond to the judge's earlier order.\n\nApple said on Friday that it has already spent a lot of time working with investigators and the FBI to help them obtain information. It sent engineers to San Bernardino to assist investigators trying to unlock the phone. The comapny suggested the government try to connect the shooter's iPhone to a Wi-Fi network that it had been connected to in the past, a tactic that would cause the device to automatically back up to Apple servers, where the data could be retrieved.\n\nWhile it's not impossible to create special software to unlock the iPhone, it would be an undue burden, the Apple official said. Apple executives said the company will keep up its efforts to increase encryption on its devices.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "A nationwide discussion is underway weighing the right of privacy versus public safety.

Had the Apple ID not changed, executives said, the data on the phone could potentially have been retrieved through the iPhone's auto-backup feature, which would have transmitted the data to the county-controlled iCloud system. Still, it's unclear whether such a tactic would have worked if the password had not been reset. Farook's phone had not backed up to iCloud since October, although it's unclear what caused the backups to discontinue.\n\nApple executives also said they provided FBI investigators with four separate options for retrieving data from the account. Ultimately, the investigators were not successful with those options, and opted to to compel Apple to construct a more exhaustive retrieval system in the court order made public on Tuesday. Notably, this matches up with the Department of Justice's description of events in a filing earlier today:\n\nFarook's phone had been making backups to iCloud through October, logging data that has already been provided to investigators. Backups can cease for a number of reasons, but it seems unlikely that the phone went two months without being plugged in within range of a trusted Wi-Fi connection. If the backups stopped because the account had reached its iCloud storage limit, then Apple could theoretically restore backups by raising the limits. It's also possible the halted backups are the result of a recently reported iOS backup bug, which could potentially be fixed through a direct, signed update. Neither process would require unlocking the phone.\n\nInvestigators have implied in a number of legal documents that Farook disabled the backup intentionally, but no concrete evidence has been provided to that effect. By the same token, Apple declined to say whether Farook's account had hit its storage limit or if the company had any information to that effect. For now, it's still a mystery why Farook's backups cut off two months before the attack.", "The Apple ID passcode for the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone was changed less than 24 hours after authorities took possession of the device, a senior Apple executive said today.\n\nAnd Apple could have recovered information from the phone had the Apple ID passcode not been changed, Apple said.\n\nIf the phone was taken to a location where it recognized the Wi-Fi network, such as the San Bernardino shooters' home, it could have been backed up to the cloud, Apple suggested.\n\nBut it is not entirely clear from Apple's court filing that the phone was in the hands of the authorities when the change was made.\n\nThe filing states \"the owner, in an attempt to gain access to some information in the hours after the attack, was able to reset the password remotely, but that had the effect of eliminating the possibility of an auto-backup.\"\n\nThe government got a warrant to search the car and get the phone in the early morning hours of Dec. 3, 2015 at 2:27 a.m. -- the day after the attack.\n\nThe attempt to reset the password could have been an attempt to use the find my phone feature to locate it, sources noted.\n\nThe phone was in possession of federal investigators at the time of the remote passcode was reset, a federal official confirmed to ABC News.\n\nThe development comes as the Justice Department is pushing forward with its legal fight against Apple, urging a federal judge to compel the tech giant to help the FBI crack open a cellphone left behind by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters.\n\nSyed Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, launched a deadly assault on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 of Farook's coworkers at a holiday party.\n\nProsecutors said Farook's device could be encrypted to the point that its content would be \"permanently inaccessible,\" and, \"Apple has the exclusive technical means which would assist the government in completing its search.\"\n\nAfter the court order, Apple quickly vowed to challenge the decision.\n\n\"The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement to customers Tuesday night. \"[T]his order ... has implications far beyond the legal case at hand.\"\n\n\"The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on [the shooter's] iPhone,\" Cook added. \"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession.\"\n\nIn addition, all of the personal and sensitive information on customers' phones \"needs to be protected from hackers and criminals who want to access it, steal it, and use it without our knowledge or permission,\" Cook wrote.\n\nIf the battle between the FBI and Apple continues, it's a matter that could work its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.", "Developers are starting to make up their minds about which new programming languages they like best.\n\nSeveral new languages have been introduced in recent years, including Google's Go, Mozilla's Rust, the scientific language Julia, and of course Apple's Swift. These languages shook up the tech industry as new technologies like Go leapfrogged more established languages in popularity. Now that action may be slowing down, according to new data published by IT analysis firm RedMonk.\n\nFor the past five years RedMonk has tracked the popularity of different programming languages by charting the number of questions about each language asked on the popular programming question-and-answer site StackOverflow and the number of lines of code written in each language stored on the code hosting and collaboration site GitHub. These metrics don't tell us much about how widespread use of each language is in the commercial sector, nor how many jobs are available for developers conversant in particular language. But it does give us a way to ballpark the level of interest different technologies have garnered from developers themselves.\n\nNot much has changed since RedMonk released its last rankings in June 2015, more than six months ago. Swift managed to creep up one spot to 17 on the list, while Go held steady at 15. Rust moved up two spots, from 46 to 48, and Julia moved up one spot to 51. None of these languages are close to displacing the top languages. JavaScript, which is all over the web and an increasingly important part of mobile development thanks to tools such as Facebook's React, is still number one. Java, which is still used to build Android apps and powers big data technologies like Hadoop, is still number two. If Swift and Go are going to replace Objective C and Java, it's going to take some time.\n\nBut even though old languages may reign supreme, the crop of new languages has already altered the development landscape for years to come. Even as things stabilize, developers have more choices than ever.\n\nGo Back to Top.

No, Oracle isn't killing the Java programming language itself, which is still widely used by many companies. Nor is it killing off JavaScript, which is a completely different language that Oracle doesn't control. What Oracle is getting rid of is a plugin that allows you to run programs known as \"Java applets\" in your browser.\n\nYou may not think you even have the Java plugin installed, but if you've ever installed Java, or if Java came pre-installed on your computer, then you probably do, even if you never use it. The good news is that Oracle won't be automatically installing the Java plugin when you install Java anymore. The bad news is that it won't be providing security updates anymore either, so you should go ahead and uninstall it now. In fact, there's a good chance you can uninstall Java entirely.\n\nSun Microsystems, which was acquired by Oracle in 2010, introduced Java applets in 1995 and the technology was briefly popular with scientists and educators, who used them to create things such as interactive physics simulators. You can still relive the heyday of Java applets through UltraStudio, an online museum of educational applets, but Java has been mostly replaced by Flash and JavaScript for creating interactive programs on the web.\n\nUnfortunately, it's managed to stick around, thanks to Oracle's practice of bundling the plugin with the Java installer. That's made it a huge target for malware creators, and browser makers have slowly tried to phase the plugin out on their own. Google Chrome stopped supporting the plugin standard on which the Java plugin depends last year, and Mozilla has announced it will do the same by the end of the year. Microsoft Internet Explorer still supports the standard, but the newer Microsoft Edge browser does not.\n\nWith Microsoft dropping support for old versions of Internet Explorer and Adobe slowly phasing out Flash, it looks like a nightmarish era for web security is finally drawing to an end.\n\nGo Back to Top.

In fact, it could make it easier for some companies to use Amazon Web Services, since it will be easier to migrate applications between their own data centers and Amazon's cloud -- and they'll have to worry less about getting locked in to Amazon's services.\n\nWalmart decided to focus entirely on open source software so the company wouldn't be beholden to any one software vendor.\n\nThis fear of being locked in is what drove Walmart to acquire OneOps back in 2013, says Jeremy King, the CTO of Walmart Labs, the division of the company that handles software engineering for all of Walmart's brands.\n\nKing joined Walmart in 2011 with the mandate of modernizing the infrastructure that ran the company's e-commerce efforts. \"We realized the old tech stack wasn't going to cut it,\" he says. \"It was all five years from being end of life. So we needed to do cloud.\"\n\nKing and his team decided to focus entirely on open source software, so the company wouldn't be beholden to any one software vendor for the foreseeable future. They standardized on OpenStack, a tool that helps developers create their own Amazon-style clouds, and started acquiring companies, including OneOps, in order to bring experienced open source developers into Walmart.\n\nNow,by open sourcing OneOps, Walmart can work with the larger opens ource community to expand the tool's functionality and support even more technologies, making it possible manage whatever new software the company wants to adopt in the future.\n\nGo Back to Top.

According to a new report from DB-Engines, a site that tracks the popularity of database technologies, Oracle was not only the most widely used and discussed database in the world in 2015, it was also saw the most growth in those areas last year as well, at least by one metric.\n\nThat's a surprise because of the past few years, DB-Engines has tracked the rise of a number of newer database systems that discard the traditional way of organizing data in favor of the less structured approaches that Google and Facebook pioneered during their ascendancy in the mid-2000s. These so-called \"NoSQL\" databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis have dominated DB-Engines' listings of the fastest growing database technologies in the world, thanks in large part to their fresh approach to managing large or quickly changing volumes of data. What's more, these databases are open source, meaning that anyone in the world can view and edit the code that underpins their software. Oracle has always dominated the rankings, but the fastest growing databases have typically been the newer open source varieties.\n\nAn Austrian technology consulting firm called Solid IT created the DB-Engines rating system to help its developers decide which new technologies were worth learning about and which were still too nascent to bother with. The company assigns each database system a score based on data gathered from many sources, such as Google Trends, various job listings sites, social media sites like Twitter, and the programming questions and answers site StackOverflow. To determine the fastest growing database systems, the company looked at which ones had the biggest total change in their scores. There's a limit to DB-Engines' accuracy because the site can't say with certainty how many companies are using any particular technology. Rather it tries to approximate a database's popularity based on job listings and the ebb and flow of conversations about the technology.\n\nOracle has always been strong on the job listings side, Solid IT co-founder Matthias Gelbmann says, but the growth this year was primarily due to a big increase in the number of conversations about Oracle's flagship product on social media and Q&A sites.\n\nIt's not clear why the number of conversations about Oracle increased last year. It could be because more companies are using Oracle's flagship product, but Gelbmann speculates that it might be that older IT pros, the sorts who still use Oracle every day, are adopting social media tools at a faster rate. Or it could be that the large organizations that rely on Oracle technologies are hiring more of the young technologists who have traditionally turned to Stack Overflow when they have a problem. But he can't be certain, because DB-Engines only tracks the trends in the data, not the causes of those trends.\n\nDonnie Berkholz, an information technology analyst at 451 Research points out that sales of new Oracle database licenses have been declining in recent quarters, and that the DB-Engines team hasn't smoothed their data, which means that many of the peaks and valleys in the site's data could be statistical anomalies rather than meaningful changes. But he says that many companies still use Oracle for a variety of reasons, including pre-existing business relationships, difficulties in migrating to other other technologies, as well as technical requirements such as instrumentation, scaling, and performance.\n\nThe results don't indicate a comeback for other proprietary relational databases. While Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2 remain some of the most highly ranked databases on DB-Engines, both slipped slightly year-over-year. Meanwhile, the open source NoSQL databases MongoDB and Cassandra, some of the top movers since DB-Engines started ranking databases, came in second and third.\n\nThe lesson? The world is still adopting new, open source databases at a rapid clip. But old-school Oracle isn't going anywhere yet.\n\nGo Back to Top.

The company said today it will open source a core piece of its Edge web browser, the successor to Internet Explorer.\n\nMicrosoft will publish the source code for Chakra, the part of Edge responsible for running JavaScript code, next month on the code sharing and collaboration site GitHub, the company said in a blog post. What's more, the company will accept code contributions from developers outside of Microsoft -- a point driven home by the fact that it made the announcement not at a company event but at the JSConf US Last Call developers conference in Florida.\n\nThis move isn't the same thing as open sourcing the entire browser. You won't be able to actually browse web pages using ChakraCore. But Microsoft thinks its JavaScript engine will find use in a wide range of applications, such as games, cloud services and Internet of Things devices.\n\nThat may seem counterintuitive, given that JavaScript was originally created as a programming language for web browsers. But in recent years the language has found a home in other applications, thanks to Node.js, a platform for running JavaScript on servers or other computers. (Node.js depends on Google's V8, the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome.)\n\nWhy, then, would developers want to use Chakra instead of V8? Microsoft claims that Chakra has better support for the latest version of JavaScript. Chakra is already used by Microsoft outside of Edge to render JavaScript on the Xbox and Windows Phone, and on the server side for technologies from Cortana the Outlook.com.\n\nNode.js can already run on Chakra instead of V8, but only on Windows systems. But Microsoft will work to make Chakra available on other platforms, according to the company. Making the software open source will open up Microsoft's options for having it bundled with Linux distributions, as well make it possible for independent developers to port ChakraCore to other platforms.\n\nAnd by sharing the code for Chakra, browser developers at Apple, Google and Mozilla can learn from Microsoft's approach and potentially improve their own JavaScript rendering engines.\n\nGo Back to Top.

It gave away all rights to Kubernetes, a cloud computing system originally designed by Google engineers, asking a non-profit to manage its development. It didn't just share some software code with the world. It agreed to let an independent party oversee the development of the code.\n\nDubbed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the organization is just the latest in a series of high profile new foundations now stewarding opens source projects created by large tech companies. In the past year, we've also seen the launch of the Cloud Foundry Foundation to govern a project originally released by VMware, the establishment of the Node.js Foundation, thanks cloud services company Joyent, and the founding of the Open Container Initiative, thanks to several different companies, most notably Docker and CoreOS. All four of these new organizations are under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, the organization originally founded to manage the Linux Kernel, the core of all Linux operating systems.\n\nThanks to these foundations, competing companies -- and independent developers -- can come together to work on projects that benefit all of them without any one company owning the final product. That makes open source even more open. It makes it easier for the world to collaborate on new software.\n\nOpen source foundations are nothing new. Linux Foundation has been around since 2007, and other major projects like the Eclipse code editing tool and the Apache web server have been governed this way for even longer. Many of the most important open source projects in recent years, such as the Hadoop big data crunching platform and the database system Cassandra, are managed by the Apache Foundation. But it's unusual to see so many new foundations created so quickly.\n\nWhile the Linux kernel, Apache server, and Hadoop platform were all started initially as non-commercial projects, some of these new projects, like Cloud Foundry, have always been corporate products. And though some major open source projects remain corporate property, such as the MongoDB database, it's becoming harder and harder to name significant projects that aren't now part of a foundation. That's a good thing.\n\nGiving It Away\n\nWhy are so many companies giving away their intellectual property? It's not happening for altruistic reasons. In his keynote at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference in Portland, Oregon last week, Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji argued that the shift is being driven by economics.\n\nCompanies like Google want others to use their open source software since it can help drive the use of online services, like Google's cloud computing tools. They want others to contribute code to this software too. But increasingly, others don't want to use or contribute to projects unless they're independently managed.\n\nVenture capitalists have been pouring money into companies dedicated to commercializing open source projects, whether that's by providing support and services for open source projects or by building proprietary products atop open source code. Docker, for example, has raised $162 million million according to Crunchbase. But new business models for open source create new challenges for the companies that maintain them.\n\n\"Turns out with all of that money, you start to generate distrust,\" Ramji said. \"So some of the old nature of the open source model is starting to break down as these projects become bigger and more valuable, I think that's where foundations come in.\"\n\nFor example, IBM and HP offer cloud services based on Cloud Foundry. It would be in their best interests to contribute back to the main Cloud Foundry project, but they might be disinclined to do so by the fact that they compete directly with Pivotal, a company spun out of VMware and EMC in part to commercialize Cloud Foundry.\n\nWhen Pivotal owned all of the work that HP and IBM developers were putting into Cloud Foundry, there was always the possibility that the company could change the open source licensing, reject a competitor's contributions, or make changes to the project that didn't fit with the plans of outside contributors. One company was calling the shots, and it had to put its own interests first. So by putting its code into a neutral, independent organization, competitors can make mutually beneficial decisions without having to worry that all of their efforts will disappear overnight.\n\nThe Downside\n\nBut there are downsides to the foundation model, argues Derek Collison, one of the original creators of Cloud Foundry and the founder of Apcera, a startup that makes tools for managing cloud infrastructures. Foundations move slower than projects governed by a small team with clear goals, and innovation can be hampered by infighting, he says, echoing the reasons many open source project leaders have given for not placing their projects into foundations over the years.\n\n\"Design by consensus has never worked,\" he says. \"And it never will unless you have someone who says 'I know the pain points, I know how to drive it forward.'\"\n\nBut Collison isn't totally against the idea of foundations. In fact, Apcera is part of the Open Container Initiative that is helping standardize an increasingly popular technology called containers. He argues that relatively little design or innovation has to happen within the foundation. With the standard established, the member companies are free to innovate as they see fit, adding their own unique features atop the standard.\n\nStandards, Please\n\nStandardization is a major driving force many of these new projects, Linux Foundation director Jim Zemlin told us last year. \"Providing a huge standards document to a light bulb manufacturer won't help it make better, cheaper bulbs,\" Zemlin told us. \"But if you hand them the open source code, then they can just start doing it.\"\n\nAnd even if foundations move more slowly than companies, they might still win out in the end. Ramji cited a study conducted by Henrik Ingo in 2010 to compare governance models of open source projects. Ingo's conclusion: There appears to be a \"glass ceiling\" limiting the growth of of single vendor projects. In other words, if you want your project to grow, giving away the code to an independent organization is the best way to do that.\n\nGo Back to Top.

Gray had no immediate comment Friday.\n\nProsecutors say Helton's \"phishing\" scheme involved sending victims emails they thought were from Apple or Google. The messages asked victims to verify their email accounts by clicking on a link that took them to a phony website, where Helton collected their usernames and passwords.\n\nProsecutors say Helton used the information to access more than 360 email accounts.\n\nHelton, 29, is scheduled to be sentenced June 2.", "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration told a U.S. magistrate judge on Friday it would be willing to allow Apple Inc. to retain possession of and later destroy specialized software it has been ordered to design to help the FBI hack into an encrypted iPhone used by the gunman in December's mass shootings in California.\n\nThe government made clear that it was open to less intrusive options in a new legal filing intended to blunt public criticism by Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who said the software would be \"too dangerous to create\" because it would threaten the digital privacy of millions of iPhone customers worldwide.\n\n\"Apple may maintain custody of the software, destroy it after its purpose under the order has been served, refuse to disseminate it outside of Apple and make clear to the world that it does not apply to other devices or users without lawful court orders,\" the Justice Department told Judge Sheri Pym. \"No one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the legal fight continued to reverberate on the presidential campaign trail as Republican candidate Donald Trump called on Americans to boycott Apple until it complies with the court order.\n\nTrump made the comment during a question-and-answer session in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, where he's campaigning ahead of Saturday's first-in-the-South Republican presidential primary. Trump says Cook wants to prove \"how liberal he is\" and told the crowd to \"boycott Apple until such time as they give up that security.\"\n\nIn the latest volley between the federal government and one of the world's most respected companies, the Justice Department argued that Apple has the technical ability to comply with a court order issued this week -- but won't do so because of its marketing strategy.\n\n\"Apple has attempted to design and market its products to allow technology, rather than the law, to control access to data which has been found by this court to be warranted for an important investigation,\" the filing states.\n\nThe Justice Department's motion, which seeks to force Apple to comply with Pym's order, appears aimed at rebutting some of the key objections of Apple and its supporters. It says that the software the government seeks, contrary to Apple's assertions, is not akin to a \"master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks.\" And it also rejects the idea that the court order placed an unreasonable burden on the company, saying Apple already has the technical wherewithal to satisfy it.\n\n\"To the extent that Apple claims that the order is unreasonably burdensome because it undermines Apple's marketing strategies or because it fears criticism for providing lawful access to the government, these concerns do not establish an undue burden,\" the government wrote.\n\nApple's written objection, already signaled by Cook in a message to Apple customers, is due next Friday.\n\nSenior Apple executives said during a phone call with reporters Friday that the company had worked for hours, even days, with federal officials and investigators to try to gain access to Farook's iPhone. The executives, who insisted on anonymity to speak freely amid ongoing legal proceedings, said they went to the FBI in early January with four suggestions, including a workaround using iCloud. Prosecutors noted the four methods and their \"deficiencies\" in a footnote in their Friday court filing.\n\nThe magistrate on Tuesday ordered Apple to provide the FBI with highly specialized software that could be loaded onto the work-issued iPhone 5C used by Syed Farook, who died with his wife in a gun battle with police after killing 14 people in December in San Bernardino, California. The U.S. has said the attacks were partly inspired by the Islamic State terror group.\n\nAlthough the judge instructed Apple to create the software for the FBI, she said it could be loaded onto the phone at an Apple facility.\n\nBut the Justice Department made explicit Friday that Apple could retain custody of the software at all times.\n\nThe specialized software would bypass a security time delay and self-destruct feature that erases all data after 10 consecutive, unsuccessful attempts to guess the unlocking passcode. This would allow the FBI to use technology to rapidly and repeatedly test numbers in what's known as a brute force attack. In their filing Friday, prosecutors explained that investigators would be willing to work remotely to test passcodes, while Apple retained both possession of the phone and the technology itself.\n\nThat's a good \"compromise position\" because \"they're giving all the power to Apple,\" said Jason Healey, a former director on cyber policy at the White House.\n\n\"They're telling Apple, 'You hold the software, we're not asking you to put a backdoor in the encryption, we just want to be able to brute force this thing,'\" Healey said. \"If the precedent is this, that they deliver the phone to Apple and Apple does it, I think that's a pretty good precedent that can't be done en masse on the next thousand iPhones.\"\n\nThe government said the county-owned phone could be valuable as evidence because Farook appeared to use the device to communicate with his wife in the months before the shootings as well as with some of his co-workers who were killed in the attacks.\n\nTwo other personal phones were found crushed beyond investigative value in the trash behind the couple's home.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee on Friday invited Cook and FBI Director James Comey to appear before it to discuss encryption technologies and issues of privacy and national security, asking both to tell Americans how they plan to move forward.\n\nA hearing in the federal case has been set for March 22 in Riverside, California.\n\n___\n\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams and Eric Tucker at https://twitter.com/etuckerAP.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

As a very quick recap: The government had earlier gotten a court order directing Apple to create special software that would help investigators crack the phone's PIN code. Apple CEO Tim Cook's letter argued this would set a dangerous precedent and could undermine the security of all iPhones).\n\nIn the new motion, U.S. attorneys argue that Apple \"retains the technical ability to comply\" with the judge's order and that its \"current refusal to comply with the Court's Order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\"\n\nThe filing specifies that the government \"has reason to believe\" that Syed Rizwan Farook used that iPhone to communicate \"with some of the very people\" he and his wife killed in the Dec. 2 mass shooting.\n\nThe tech industry, however, broadly views this as a precedent-setting case. For instance, experts' opinions vary on whether the government truly does require Apple's help to crack into the phone. (The filing argues that Apple's help is critical.) Google, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter have issued statements in support of Apple's opposition.\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention is whether this is a matter of writing software so carefully targeted to this individual phone that it wouldn't ever be usable to break into other phones. There's a lot we don't know about the way iPhone security technology works, and technical experts disagree on the feasibility of this task.\n\nApple itself, in simplest terms, doesn't want such software to exist to begin with. Cook suggested that software written specifically for one phone could be in danger of being tweaked to apply to other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.\n\nGovernment attorneys argue that such a threat is overstated. \"The software never has to come into the government's custody,\" the filing says. \"Just as with Apple's already-existing operating systems and software, no one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.\"\n\nBoth parties and the judge have also agreed on a timeline for this case, which many observers think could become a landmark in the long-running debate over privacy and surveillance.", "As Apple and Justice Department lawyers duke it out in court over the government's attempts to force the tech company to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino killers, there are calls for a legislative solution in the debate that pits privacy against national security concerns.\n\nBut the chances of Congress coming up with a what would almost certainly be a controversial solution to a highly complex issue in an election year seem remote. In part, that's because no can can figure out how to resolve the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, during a campaign stop in South Carolina, Republican Donald Trump called on consumers to boycott Apple, until the company complies with the court order to to come up a way to bypass the iPhone's encryption.\n\nLawmakers Picking Sides\n\nSome lawmakers, most notably Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have taken sides.\n\n\"Apple chose to protect a dead ISIS terrorist's privacy over the security of the American people,\" Cotton said in a statement, adding that \"legislation is likely the only way to resolve this issue.\"\n\nCalifornia Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has also shifted into the pro-legislation category. Earlier this month Schiff was quoted as saying a legislative solution to the issue was not \"feasible or even desirable.\" On Wednesday, Schiff issued a statement that \"these complex issues will ultimately need to be resolved by Congress, the Administration and industry, rather than the courts alone, since they involve important matters of public policy.\"\n\nBut Schiff has not offered a specific course of action, adding, \"We are far from any consensus.\"\n\nThe chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina, has written that \"Apple needs to comply with the court's order.\"\n\nBurr and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, California's Dianne Feinstein, have had ongoing discussions about legislation to force tech companies to decrypt their devices if ordered to do so by a court. A spokeswoman for Burr, however, said there is no draft bill yet, and that the senator was working \"on his own schedule\" on the proposal.\n\nIndependent Sen. Angus King of Maine, another member of the intelligence panel, told NPR's Morning Edition Friday that \"this is a really tough issue\" and that he could \"argue it either way.\" King said that to decide it in this case \"is I think the wrong approach. There is an old saying in law school: 'Hard cases make bad law.' \"\n\nKing was critical of the Obama administration for not proposing legislation to address the encryption issue, saying its something the FBI has \"been sounding alarms about ... for more than a year.\"\n\nOne possible path forward for lawmakers is that Washington staple, the blue ribbon commission. In fact, House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul of Texas and Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia have proposed just such a panel, a \"national commission on security and technology challenges in the digital age.\"\n\nIt would be comprised of \"a body of experts representing all of the interests at stake so we can evaluate and improved America's security posture as technology-and our adversaries-evolve.\" The two wrote the panel would be charged with \"developing a range of actionable recommendations that can protect privacy and public safety.\"\n\nPresidential Candidates Grappling With Issue\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail there is a similarly wide range of views and lack of consensus about how to address the encryption-national security argument.\n\nOn one side is Trump's call for an Apple boycott, something he told his supporters at a rally \"just occurred to me.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio called it \"a tough issue,\" but that he hoped Apple would comply with the order, adding, \"Ultimately I think being a good corporate citizen is important.\"\n\nAt a town hall meeting on MSNBC Thursday night, the two Democratic candidates also weighed in. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, asked who's side he was on, Apple or the FBI's, responded \"both.\"\n\nSanders said, \"All of us would be very dismayed if we learned that we could've picked up information about a potential terrorist act and we didn't do that. People would not feel good about this.\"\n\nBut Sanders added, \"There has got to be a balance.\" Calling himself \"a very strong civil libertarian,\" Sanders says he believes \"we can fight terrorism without undermining our constitutional rights and our privacy rights.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton position was also nuanced. She called it \"a very hard dilemma,\" that's \"going to have lots of ramifications. But I see both sides.

Dianne Feinstein on Friday strongly denounced Apple's rebuffing of a court order directing the technology giant to help federal investigators unlock a mobile phone used by an assailant in the deadly terror attack in San Bernardino.\n\n\"Apple is not above the laws of the United States,\" Feinstein told a lunchtime audience in Sacramento. \"Nor should anyone, or any company, be above the laws.\"\n\nFederal officials are working to force Apple to obey Wednesday's order, something CEO Tim Cook has said the Cupertino-based company would not do. Cook called the demand an \"unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers.\"\n\nFeinstein, vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said while she understands Apple's motivation, \"I would be hopeful that Mr. Cook, whom I have talked to on matters that are similar to this, would reconsider\" and work with the federal government to see that the phone is unencrypted.\n\nHer remarks came in a conversation with PPIC President Mark Baldassare for the organization's series on the future of California.\n\nFeinstein spoke about the growing global threat posed by the terrorist group ISIS, which she said has grown to 36,500 fighters and 11 counties with the goal of wiping out the West. To renew her daily resolve, Feinstein said she keeps on her desk a stack of photos. Topping the pile is a picture of a 6-year-old girl from northern Iraq, dressed in a plaid gingham dress, white tights and Mary Janes, lying on her back with her head chopped off. \"Now that is pure evil,\" she said.\n\nA member of the Judiciary Committee, she also weighed in on her own political future, a statewide effort to legalize marijuana as well as President Barack Obama's pending nomination to replace Justice Antonin Scalia. She predicted a \"very rocky\" confirmation process, and suggested a lower court judge, or nominee with impeccable credentials, would have the best chance of being seated.\n\n\"If (Obama's) nominee has been confirmed before by both political parties that takes a lot of the angst out of it and a lot of the opposition out of it,\" she said.\n\nFeinstein said she doesn't expect to take to take sides between Democrats Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez in this year's Senate race to succeed her retiring colleague, Barbara Boxer, at least not in the primary. \"I think they are both good candidates,\" she said.\n\nOn legalizing marijuana, contained in a fall ballot measure being championed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Feinstein demurred: \"That may be one of the few issues that I would disagree with Gavin on. I am not really for recreational use of marijuana. Medical use, yes.\"\n\nFeinstein, 82, said she has yet to decide if she'll seek reelection when her fourth term expires in 2018.\n\n\"My health is good,\" she said. \"But I have learned one thing about life: No one ever knows what the future brings.\n\n\"I have to be able to get something done ...

Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! By Katie Benner & Nicole Perlroth\n\nLetters from around the globe began pouring into the inbox of Timothy D Cook not long after the publication of the first revelations from Edward J Snowden about mass government surveillance. Do you know how much privacy means to us? they asked Apple's chief executive. Do you understand?\n\nCook did. He was proud that Apple sold physical products -- phones, tablets and laptops -- and did not traffic in the intimate, digital details of its customers' lives.\n\nThat stance crystallised on Tuesday when Cook huddled for hours with lawyers and others at Apple's headquarters to figure out how to respond to a federal court order requiring the company to let the United States government break into the iPhone of one of the gunmen in a San Bernardino, California, mass shooting. Late Tuesday, Cook took the fight public with a letter to customers that he personally signed.\n\n\"We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government,\" wrote Cook, 55. \"Ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.\"\n\nCook's standoff with law enforcement officials is indicative of his personal evolution from a behind-the-scenes operator at Apple to one of the world's most outspoken corporate executives. During that time, he has moved a once secretive Silicon Valley company into the centre of highly charged social and legal issues. While Cook's predecessor, Apple co-founder Steven P Jobs, was considered a business icon, he never took aggressive positions on such matters as Cook now has.\n\nBeing at loggerheads with the US government is risky for Apple and may draw a torrent of public criticism of the world's most valuable company at a time when its growth rate has significantly decelerated. Yet people who know Cook said he did not believe he had a choice but to be vocal. Cook, who became Apple's chief executive in 2011, has long said that businesses and their leaders should think of themselves as important members of civic society. In September, he emphasised that this responsibility \"has grown markedly in the last couple of decades or so as government has found it more difficult to move forward.\"\n\nCook \"says what he believes, especially in difficult situations,\" said Don Logan, the former chairman of Time Warner Cable who has been friends with Cook since he became chief executive of Apple, bonding over their shared alma mater, Auburn University. Of Cook's opposition to the court order, Logan said: \"Tim is currently dealing with a very difficult situation and he knows the decision he has made has lots of ramifications, good or bad. But he wants to do the right thing.\"\n\nHis outspokenness has drawn criticism, with some investors questioning how nonbusiness initiatives -- including some of Apple's environmental moves -- would contribute to the company's bottom line. Cook responded at a shareholder meeting that it is important for Apple to do things \"because they're just and right.\"\n\nAfter December's San Bernardino attack, Apple worked with the FBI to gather data that had been backed up to the cloud from a work iPhone issued to one of the assailants, according to court filings. When investigators also wanted unspecified information on the phone that had not been backed up, the judge this week granted the order requiring Apple to create a special tool to help investigators more easily crack the phone's passcode and get into the device. Apple had asked the FBI to issue its application for the tool under seal. But the government made it public, prompting Cook to go into bunker mode to draft a response. The result was the letter that Cook signed on Tuesday, where he argued that it set a \"dangerous precedent\" for a company to be forced to build tools for the government that weaken security.\n\n\"Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk,\" he wrote. \"That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.\" Far from backing down from the fight, Cook has told colleagues that he plans to accelerate plans to encrypt everything stored on Apple's myriad devices, services and in the cloud, where the bulk of data is still stored unencrypted.\n\n\"If you place any value on civil liberties, you don't do what law enforcement is asking,\" Cook has said.", "Kanye West is standing his ground again. After weeks of Twitter rants including going in on Wiz Khalifa, asking Mark Zuckerberg for a billy to fund his creative passions, and stating Bill Cosby is innocent, the outspoken 'Ye is planning on coming for a new target: Pirate Bay.\n\nSince West decided to go against the grain and not sell his album directly, dropping his highly anticipated project The Life of Pablo exclusively on TIDAL after his Saturday Night Live appearance last week, downloads have boosted for the TIDAL app, but also stimulated a surge in bootlegging. Now 'Ye plans to take legal action against Pirate Bay for copyright infringement and loss of earnings.\n\nThe Life of Pablo was originally slated for a TIDAL premiere and then Yeezus was supposed to distribute it for sale via other outlets like Apple Music, but in Ye's unapologetic fashion he changed his mind. \"My album will never never never be on Apple. And it will never be for sale... You can only get it on Tidal,\" he tweeted on Feb. 15.\n\nThe move was too little, too late as fans reportedly purchased the album prior to the TIDAL exclusive. Those copies of the album leaked to numerous torrent sites including Pirate Bay. Yeezy allegedly has his legal team going frantic in efforts to find ways to approach Pirate Bay, but it may not be much they can do.\n\nAccording to Geek, the new owners of Pirate Bay are very private on the contrary to the site and it may be more of a hassle getting them into court and seeing a suit through. Maybe digital streaming isn't the answer just yet. It looks like selling it the old school way could have been the best way to keep from adding to that 53 million in personal debt.", "SAN FRANCISCO -- The U.S. technology industry is lining up behind Apple over its refusal to help the FBI break into the iPhone used by one of the terrorists in December's San Bernardino massacre -- albeit cautiously.\n\nJan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says statements of public support from major tech companies have been guarded and \"somewhat lukewarm\" with Google and Facebook voicing public support for Apple more forcefully and swiftly than Microsoft, Yahoo and Twitter.\n\nSome may be trying to avoid scrutiny, fearing the same recriminations and loss of trust that followed Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations that major tech and telecom companies had secretly given the U.S. government vast amounts of consumer data, said longtime Silicon Valley futurist Paul Saffo.\n\n\"What took them so long?

Yahoo had previously referred reporters to statements from industry groups.\n\nStill, if the courts say Apple has to comply, there's really nothing other tech companies can do to help, said analyst Dawson. \"As far as I know, the other big tech companies have always complied in the past with similar court orders, as has Apple, and I suspect they'll continue to do so in future,\" Dawson said. \"So even if they respect Apple's stance here, it's hard for them to back it to the hilt.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn @jguynn\n\n35 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TvhnpO", "The U.S. government is seeking to force Apple Inc. to take immediate steps to unlock an iPhone used by one of the perpetrators of the December 2015 San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack, which left 14 dead.\n\n\"Rather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack ...

Federico Lombardi sought to clarify the issue Friday, telling Vatican Radio that Francis' comments were \"in no way a personal attack nor an indication on how to vote.\"\n\nLombardi noted Francis often has advocated \"building not walls, but bridges,\" especially regarding Europe, as it struggles to handle the arrival of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty.\n\n___\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nTed Cruz is channeling his inner Donald Trump as he looks for votes ahead of Saturday's South Carolina's presidential primary.\n\nThe Texas senator told several hundred supporters Friday in Myrtle Beach that in a Cruz administration, there would \"be winning so much, we'll get tired of winning.\"\n\nHe didn't specifically name his rival, but the reference was clear as it's a phrase repeatedly used by the billionaire businessman.\n\nCruz also took a shot at Trump's campaign motto, featured on hats, T-shirts and bumper stickers. The senator said \"it's easy to say, 'Let's Make America Great Again.'\" But, he asked, \"Do you understand what made America great in the first place?\"\n\n___\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nJohn Kasich is promising South Carolina voters he'll \"keep hanging in there\" regardless of the results in the state's Saturday Republican primary.\n\nKasich's comments were in response to a voter at a Columbia town hall Friday who told Kasich not to drop out of the race after Saturday's contest. The voter pleaded with the candidate to \"not quit on us; we need you more than you need us.\"\n\nKasich said he thinks he'll beat expectations Saturday, joking that they aren't that high anyway.\n\nHe said expectations say he'll be able to fit all of his votes \"in a Volkswagon,\" adding, \"clearly we're gonna do better than that -- we may be able to put them in a van.\"\n\n___\n\n11:00 a.m.\n\nJeb Bush is warmly embracing his legacy in South Carolina, where he is among three generations of his famous Republican family campaigning in the state.\n\nBush's 91-year-old mother, who attended college prep school in Charleston, is with her son, the second to run for president. Mrs. Bush, whose husband is also a former president, says of her second son: \"He's steady, he's honest. He is modest. He is kind and he is good.\"\n\nThe former Florida governor's wife Columba and younger son Jeb Bush Jr. are also with him, as are his younger brothers, Neal and Marvin Bush.\n\nWhile some voters feel reluctance toward a potential third Bush presidency, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top Bush backer, says there is no such thing as dynasty in America.\n\n\"The only way you can become president is if your fellow citizens vote for you,\" he said.\n\n___\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nSouth Carolina's highest ranking Democrat is endorsing Hillary Clinton, smoothing over a rift from eight years ago.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn's endorsement came as a surprise since he has said he wouldn't back a candidate.\n\nClyburn has said that those regulations caused him some sleepless nights in 2008, when he'd hoped to support then-Sen. Barack Obama's historic run, but stayed neutral. Bill Clinton didn't think Clyburn was neutral enough and the congressman wrote in his biography that the former president called and swore at him at 2:15 a.m. one morning.\n\nThe two eventually patched their rift, leading Clyburn to historically black Allen University in Columbia on Friday to make his endorsement.\n\nClyburn was first voted to the U.S. House in 1992 and is the assistant Democratic leader.\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio has landed himself in a tight spot in South Carolina when confronted with the politics of sports.\n\nRubio told a crowd of University of South Carolina sports fans Friday that he would be conflicted on Saturday, when the state's Gamecocks play the University of Florida Gators.\n\nUniversity of South Carolina men's basketball coach Frank Martin spoke at a Friday rally in Columbia, talking up his similarities with the presidential hopeful, including his Cuban heritage.\n\nAfter a fan shouted, \"Go Gamecocks!\" Martin suggested that Rubio follow \"your heart and the voters of South Carolina.\" Rubio has a total of five stops on his statewide fly-around South Carolina ahead of its GOP primary on Saturday.\n\n___\n\n10:10 a.m.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz is jokingly proposing Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson for a top diplomatic post.\n\n\"Imagine just for a moment: Phil Robertson, ambassador to the United Nations,\" the Texas senator said at a Friday morning rally in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. \"How much would you pay to see the Russian ambassador's face when Phil says: 'What is wrong with you people?\"\n\nCruz is campaigning Friday with the bearded reality television star on the eve of the South Carolina Republican presidential primary. Robertson is a cult hero among social conservatives for his unvarnished critiques of modern, secular society.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Cruz, Robertson urged voters to \"rise up as the sons and daughters of God\" and put \"a staunch, Bible-belieiving, Jesus-loving, Godly man\" in the White House.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Apple complies with valid subpoenas,\" he said, arguing that the request for encryption-defying technology is different.\n\nNo such technology now exists, he said.\n\n\"In the wrong hands, this software -- which does not exist today -- would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,\" he said.\n\n\"Customers expect Apple and other technology companies to do everything in our power to protect their personal information, and at Apple we are deeply committed to safeguarding their data.\"\n\nFarook, 28, and his emigree wife, 27-year-old Tashfeen Malik -- carried out the massacre at the Inland Regional Center immediately following a Christmas party there, according to federal authorities.

Carey Davis was a little more moderate in his reply, but also said in a statement that he hopes Apple will cooperate with the authorities.\n\n\"The attack on December 2nd was the deadliest terrorist attack in the US since 9/11, and law enforcement officials continue to follow up on leads related to the case,\" he said. \"Officials do not know whether any information related to the investigation exists on the phone, but the judge's decision is appropriate given the nature of the attack, and the potential to uncover clues related to this terrorist attack and/or future attacks.

Instead, they sideload the games on your device as a piece of software, and they're given controls that are adapted for the touch screen.\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll be showing you a method that still works to this day for getting emulators on your iOS device, and the best part is, you don't even have to be jailbroken to do any of it.\n\nOne thing you need to know right off the bat about emulators is that you should never download a game that you don't personally own. This is because the games you can get via emulators have something called a ROM, which is a piece of software that is intellectual property and belongs to the game manufacturer.\n\nIf you own the game, you're probably fairly in your bounds to transfer that ROM over to your iPhone and play it, but for all tends in purposes, we won't be showing you the exact process to download ROMs on your iOS device because some people may mistreat this responsibility.\n\nOne the other hand, we'll gladly show you how to get the Emulator software installed on your iPhone, because there's nothing wrong with emulator software!\n\nTo get the emulator software on your iOS device, there are a fair amount of steps you'll need to follow; they're not difficult, but there are a lot of things you'll need to do. Nevertheless, we'll outline them for you below.\n\n2) Launch the app and sign up using your mobile phone number, then confirm the phone number with the code you're given.\n\n3) Once all set up, tap on the search field at the top of the app, and search for \"Xaiojigame\" without the quotes.\n\n4) Tap on the user indicated in the screenshots above. The user's name should be in Japanese.\n\n5) From the page that opens up, tap on the \"iOS\" button at the bottom.\n\n6) In the conversation that appears next, tap on the blue link shown in the screenshots above. It'll be in Japanese.\n\n7) Once you see a dark screen, tap on the ellipsis \"...\" button to open a Share Sheet, and from there you'll tap on the \"Open in Safari\" button.\n\n8) Your Safari app will launch and load a webpage. From this webpage, you'll tap on the \"Step 1: Download for iOS\" button.\n\n9) When prompted, tap on the \"Install\" button to begin installing the emulator.\n\n10) The emulator app will now download and install itself onto your Home screen.\n\n11) The emulator app is called \"Happy Chick\" on the Home screen.\n\n12) You will now need to trust the software, because it's a type of Enterprise software. To do this, launch the Settings app and navigate to General > Device Management > Shenzhen Misi Interactive Entertainment.\n\n13) Now tap on the blue \"Trust Shenzhen Misi Interactive Entertainment\" button, then tap on the red \"Trust\" button when prompted. A red \"Delete App\" button should appear if you did this correctly, but don't tap on that button.\n\n14) Now go back to the Home screen and launch the \"Happy Chick\" app. You can deny the app Camera and Location Services access for your own privacy. The app will ask you for an activation code.\n\n15) Return to your Safari app where you have the webpage you were just using, and copy the activation code you were given.\n\n16) Now return to the Happy Chicks app and paste that verification code into the text field and tap on the Activate button just to the right of the text field.\n\n17) You should now be able to start searching the app. You can search for titles you own, or you can browse by category.\n\nInstalling enterprise certificates is one way that an iOS device can be infected with malware or taken over by hackers. It's because you're trusting a side-loaded app that is installed on your device without the approval of Apple or the App Store, and there's no telling what kinds of programmatic code may be lurking in the app.\n\nAlthough we think this emulator is safe for use, we can't make any guarantees, so you will have to do this at your own risk if you have the desire to play emulated games on your iOS devices.\n\nSince the app requires use of WeChat, which in itself requires use of a phone number, you will have to set up a WeChat account for each device, which means you'll need more than one mobile phone number. For this reason, I suggest you choose carefully on what device you're planning to use your emulator app on.\n\nThe activation code that we used in our screenshots could only be used once, and the case will be the same for you when you follow these steps, so don't bother trying to share your code or try using it on multiple devices, because it won't work.\n\nEmulator games will run smoothly on just about all of Apple's latest 64-bit devices with a steady 50-60 frames per second. Obviously, this depends on the game and the device, but Apple's iPhone 6s or iPad Pro will run games with butter-smooth fluidity with no questions asked. With that being said, the only thing you really have to worry about is whether or not controls have been ported nicely to the touch screen or not.\n\nBest of all, because it doesn't require a jailbreak to use, you can install it on any of your iOS 9 devices, whether it's a jailbreakable firmware or not. This includes iOS 9.3 beta. If you change your mind on using it, you can delete the emulator app at any time to remove it and its games from your device.\n\nThe emulator will support games that have been made for the following game console platforms:\n\nIf you're looking for an emulator app that's easy to install and doesn't require a jailbreak to use, then the Xaiojigame WeChat method is a great way to look. As always, we don't condone piracy, so we suggest you don't use any games with the emulator software that don't belong to you.\n\nDid you find this tutorial helpful?

And even if Apple prevails in court this time, lawmakers across the US and throughout the world are now considering laws that would require that all companies build back doors into all of our devices by default.\n\nIn the years preceding my imprisonment, I worked as a software programmer, designing and developing web interfaces, secure databases and communication software; later, I was employed as an intelligence analyst for the US army. Throughout each of these jobs, we used different kinds of encryption to keep prying eyes out of information we handled.\n\nHowever, folks like me face even higher stakes than that. For instance, a trans woman living and working in a less open country (like Russia, Uganda and Nigeria) can face even more serious legal consequences -- including imprisonment, torture and even execution -- if exposed. Queer and trans people living in such countries depend on encrypted devices to build and maintain their communities and voices while avoiding dangerous scrutiny.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has already argued that requiring the company to create a bypass or \"back door\" would set a dangerous precedent and that it would undermine the security of all such mobile devices. Other technology companies, including Twitter and Facebook, have weighed in by restating their position that they would \"fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security\" of their devices and services.\n\nI disagree with Apple on many things -- such as its exclusive use of proprietary software and arbitrary restrictions on users seeking to copy, share, edit and create software on their devices. However, I strongly feel that defending its users' and customers' right to strong encryption in court is incredibly important.\n\nProsecutors and law enforcement agencies have a genuine interest in obtaining evidence of wrongdoing, but we need to limit how such evidence is collected. In the case of Apple, complying with this order would almost certainly have negative consequences that would outweigh any law enforcement value, because it could allow anyone from individual criminals to powerful organizations and countries to exploit such \"back doors.\"\n\nAnd, while in the US and Europe it is easy to forget that our governments have used law enforcement resources to target participants in the civil rights movement, environmentalists, anti-corporate protesters and queer and trans people, many of those same communities in other countries don't have the luxury of forgetting the ways in which their governments claim to be protecting society by persecuting vulnerable communities.\n\nPrivacy is not a luxury in America: it is a right -- one that we need to defend in the digital realm as much as in the physical realm. We need to stay vigilant to maintain access to that right, though ... especially as technology continues to advance, and especially when a single order by a US judge to unlock one mobile device threatens to alter the entire digital privacy world as we know it.", "Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed that the government take the issue of unlocking the iPhone out of court.\n\nApple is resisting the order of a judge in Southern California, now supported by a motion from the U.S. Justice Department, telling the company to bypass strong encryption on an iPhone 5c used by one of the alleged mass-killers in San Bernardino, California. Law enforcement officials want to get at data that might be stored on the iPhone, and that can only be retrieved if Apple writes new software to unlock the iphone in question. Any other law-enforcement attempt to hack the iPhone (i.e., without Apple's technical cooperation) is likely to cause the phone to self-erase and render the data permanently irretrievable.\n\nToday, Apple CEO Tim Cook posted an open letter on Apple's website, calling for a \"government commission or panel of experts\" to explore the issues raised by powerful encryption embedded in its and other companies' smartphones, for \"law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.\" He also wrote that the government should drop its effort to compel Apple to break into the San Bernardino iPhone.\n\nPeter Swire, a computer-privacy expert at the Scheller College of Business at Georgia Tech who served on the Obama Administration's NSA review panel, said that if such a commission were to be established and recommend legislation, the process could succeed -- in spite of partisan divisions and lack of progress on many issues in Congress.\n\n\"Legislation has a chance of passing when both sides have something to lose,\" said Swire. \"Government is risking being told it can't move forward. Apple is risking being told it has to make software changes it doesn't want to make. So government and Apple may have a middle ground where they can agree to some sorts of government access, while still keeping cyber-security strong.\"\n\nThe alternative path -- letting this issue continue to be adjudicated by the courts, possibly ultimately by the U.S. Supreme Court -- is not sensible, said Daniel Weitzner, director of the MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative and a former official in the Obama White Hosue dealing with technology policy. Weitzner said the current process isn't likely to satisfy law enforcement's legitimate need to investigate suspects and international bad actors, nor to satisfy major U.S. technology companies, whose reputation for protecting customers' data and privacy from intrusive governments and hackers is at stake.\n\n\"You have a question of significant technology policy, privacy policy, international competitiveness, being decided by one court sitting in Southern California,\" said Weitzner. \"I don't think it's really appropriate for courts to be making these kinds of policy decisions.\"", "They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

You tap it, and the transaction has been OK'd,\" Ajay Bhalla, MasterCard's chief product security officer, told CNN.\n\nMasterCard started testing this product last year. On Monday, the company announced \"selfie pay\" is here to stay. Based on feedback, it seems like the decision was easy.\n\nIt's not just about playing to our strengths, though. MasterCard says by requiring a user to blink during the selfie photo, hackers or thieves won't be able to beat the system by just holding up a photo of the account holder.\n\nMasterCard isn't the only company toying with new technology. HSBC will soon let account holders access accounts via voice and fingerprints.\n\nApple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay all let users authorize payments with a fingerprint.\n\nBut MasterCard may be going a step further. According to VentureBeat, the company is developing a way to authenticate credit card transactions through a user's heartbeat.\n\nSo it may take us awhile to feel comfortable with that one.

Currently, people earn a star for each transaction, regardless of how much they spend, and get a free food or item of their choice after earning 12 stars.\n\nPeople will now have to earn 125 stars for a free item, with each dollar spent being worth two stars - meaning they have to spend $62.50 to get their free item.\n\n___\n\nVerizon to buy fiber-optic business for about $1.8 billion\n\nNEW YORK -- Verizon says it will pay $1.8 billion to buy the fiber-optic network business of XO Communications, in a deal that the wireless phone company said would improve service for its customers.\n\nXO Communications, based in Herndon, Virginia, owns and operators networks that its customers use for Internet access, cloud computing and other uses.

The phone in question, which belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, is password protected and, if the wrong password is entered too many times, all data on the phone could be erased.\n\nThe back and forth between Apple and the FBI kicked off last week after a ruling by federal Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, in which she told the company it would be required to produce specialized software for the feds so they could bypass the auto-erase feature on Farook's work phone.\n\nMeanwhile, some victims and affected families in the mass shooting will file documents in support of the judge's order that Apple help the FBI hack into the locked iPhone as part of the terrorism investigation, a lawyer said Monday.\n\nA Los Angeles attorney, Stephen Larson, said he represents at least several families of victims and other employees he declined to identify but who were affected by the shootings. He said the U.S. attorney in the case, Eileen Decker, sought his help. Larson said he will file a brief supporting the Justice Department before March 3.\n\nThe victims \"have questions that go simply beyond the criminal investigation ... in terms of why this happened, how this happened, why they were targeted, is there anything about them on the iPhone -- things that are more of a personal victim\" view, Larson said.\n\nAn appeal by victims in the case gives the Justice Department additional support in a case that has sparked a national debate over digital privacy rights and national security interests.\n\nThe county-issued iPhone 5C was used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at an office holiday party in December before they died in a gun battle with police. The government said they had been at least partly inspired by the Islamic State.\n\nThe couple physically destroyed two personal phones so completely that the FBI has been unable to recover information from them.\n\nFarook had worked as a county health inspector. Larson said the government has a strong case because of Farook's diminished privacy interests as a \"dead, murderous terrorist\" and because the phone was owned by his employer, the county government. \"You're weighing that against the interest of enforcement in an investigation and the victims and their interest in obtaining this knowledge,\" he said.\n\nLarson, a former U.S. district judge, said he knew Pym, the magistrate, and described her as an \"extraordinary jurist\" when she argued in his courtroom as a then-federal prosecutor.\n\nApple Inc. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged in a letter to employees earlier Monday that \"it does not feel right\" to refuse to help the FBI, but he said to do so would threaten data security for millions by creating essentially a master key that could later be duplicated and used against other phones.\n\nCook's email came hours after FBI director James Comey said in an online post that Apple owes it to the San Bernardino victims to cooperate and the FBI \"can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.\"\n\nApple's supporters are planning to turn out to back the company in protests against the FBI in the case, planned Tuesday evening outside Apple's stores in about 50 cities in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany and Hong Kong. In Washington, people are being asked to express their displeasure outside the FBI's headquarters.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, 51 percent of Americans say Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the ongoing FBI investigation, while 38 percent say Apple should not to ensure the security of other users' information.

Apple has warned that creating \"backdoor\" access to the encrypted iPhone data could potentially leave other users' iPhones vulnerable to government surveillance or hackers. The remaining 11 percent said they didn't know.\n\nFor the poll, Pew surveyed 1,002 adults between February 18 and 21. The news surrounding the dispute has spread widely, with 75 percent of people surveyed saying they had heard either a lot (39 percent) or at least a little bit (36 percent) about the story.\n\nThe poll also looked at how the dispute between the FBI and Apple broke down along political party lines. Perhaps surprisingly in these partisan times, both Republicans and Democrats viewed the dispute similarly -- 56 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Democrats said that Apple should unlock the suspected terrorist's phone.\n\nThose who don't fall within the traditional parties were more conflicted. Pew found that 45 percent of people who considered themselves Independents said Apple should unlock the phone, while about 42 percent of Independents said it should not, with 13 percent undecided.\n\nThings get a little more complicated when you break down Independents into sub-categories -- 58 percent of those who lean toward the Republican end of things said that Apple should unlock the phone, compared to 34 percent of the more Democrat-leaning Independents.\n\nThe dispute drew sharp distinctions between age groups. Among younger adults aged 18 to 29, 47 percent said Apple should unlock the phone, while 43 percent said it should not. For those 65 and older, 54 percent felt Apple should unlock the phone, while a mere 27 percent said the company should not comply.\n\nWhat about those who are smartphone owners? Do they feel differently about creating a backdoor that could unlock phones and access data? Half of respondents who said they own a smartphone believe that Apple should unlock the iPhone -- but so do 52 percent of non-smartphone owners. The difference was in their level of opposition: 41 percent of smartphone owners said Apple should not cooperate, while just 33 percent of non-smartphone owners supported the company's position.\n\nActual iPhone users were split down the middle, with slightly more -- 47 percent -- saying Apple should unlock the phone, and 43 percent saying it should not.", "When it comes to the dispute over San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone, new findings show that public support is on the side of the Justice Department.\n\nData from the Pew Research Center show that the majority of Americans -- 51 percent -- think Apple should cooperate with a federal court order.

So what are the privacy implications? Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nNews analysis: The dispute between Apple and the federal government is taking on tones of a political campaign. So far, the public is on the government's side.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- The dispute between Apple and the federal government over whether the iPhone maker should be forced to hack into a device used by one of the San Bernardino killers has taken on tones of a political campaign, defined as much by press releases and blog posts as legal filings.\n\nTo recap: The government late last week accused Apple of treating the case as a glorified marketing strategy. (Apple disputes that assertion, which was made in a motion.)\n\nApple executives countered, holding on-background briefings with reporters during which they highlighted that authorities had bungled the evidence.\n\nFBI Director James Comey, on Sunday, said in a blog post that the agency owes the victims of the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings a \"thorough\" investigation. And, on Monday, Apple urged the government to withdraw its request.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nApple urges government to drop iPhone request\n\nThe ping-pong match between Apple's execs and the U.S. government appears to be a strategy to win in legal court as well as the court of public opinion. Although the Friday filing requested the court force Apple's hand, it seemed more a way to air the government's rhetoric that Apple cared more about its business model than any other reason.\n\n\"It is strategically prudent for Apple to ensure public trust of its brand name,\" says Hunter Newby, a telecom expert who is CEO of Allied Fiber, a company that builds and operates fiber optic networks. \"That is its No. 1 priority. Protect its turf.\"\n\nThe FBI has ratcheted its PR posturing in what it considers a seminal case, attorney Bennet Kelley says, because Apple CEO Tim Cook took the matter public. \"Now, the FBI doesn't just have to convince a federal magistrate but the media, which is sensitive to privacy, and the American people,\" said Kelley, an attorney with Santa Monica, Calif.-based Internet Law Center, a firm that specializes in Internet law.\n\nAli Aalaei, an attorney who specializes in tech and federal court litigation with San Francisco-based Ari Law, says the dust-up underscores a pivotal moment in the escalating skirmish between technology companies that have monetized oceans of consumer data and law-enforcement officials who are seeking access to that data, especially to \"get the bad guys.\"\n\nAssisting Apple, and underscoring the importance of the legal dispute, is superstar attorney Ted Olson. He successfully argued on behalf of George W.

Simpson's defense team's playbook when it blamed authorities for inadvertently re-setting the Apple ID passcode. (Simpson's attorneys, defending the former football's star against charges he murdered his ex-wife and a restaurant employee, argued police had altered key evidence.)\n\nUSA TODAY\n\niPhone ID passcode changed in government possession\n\nIn the government's motion Friday, the FBI said Syed Farook -- the husband in the husband-wife team pair of attackers -- intentionally disabled the phone's iCloud backup function six weeks before the Dec. 2 attack that killed 14 and wounded 22. The Justice Department has acknowledged that the password was re-set in the hours after the attack by authorities with San Bernardino County.\n\nThe tainted evidence gambit isn't exactly resonating with the public, which favors the FBI on security grounds.\n\nThe verdict in public opinion? Split. At least four polls -- a SurveyMonkey survey for USA TODAY, and studies from Pew Research Center, CNN and Vrge Analytics -- illustrate a deep divide among Americans between national security (FBI) and privacy (Apple).\n\n\"If Americans cared, or knew as much about privacy as they should, it would be a landslide in favor of Apple,\" Allied Fiber's Newby says. \"The only reason they're aware of this issue is because of Apple's involvement.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nApple vs. USA -- what happened?\n\nApple, in part, is banking on its shimmering reputation with people. For the ninth year in a row, it was most recently named Fortune's most-admired company. It has sold more than 750 million iPhones. It is part of the American zeitgeist, as a maker of popular andaesthetic products. It is the most valued company in the world, at $532 billion.\n\nApple's adamant stance on privacy is as much about defining its global brand and profits, as it is of principle. In China, its second-largest market, where it hauled in $59 billion in sales its last fiscal year, it is a status symbol in part because its devices are so hard to crack. That is hugely significant for a populace leery of government surveillance, hacking and cybercriminals.\n\nBut for the government, which has as much at stake as Apple in its battle against terrorism, this case offers its best opportunity yet to gain access to digital data in a criminal case, says lawyer Aalaei. It might go as far as filing obstruction of justice charges against Apple, he says.\n\nIn an ever-escalating battle for an edge in what is shaping as a monumental case, nothing is outside the realm of possibility -- whether through a blog or the judicial bench. .\n\nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz\n\nENCRYPTION BATTLE: APPLE REFUSES FBI ORDER TO CREATE BACKDOOR TO THE IPHONEFBI fires back in its epic battle with Apple over encryption | 01:23\n\nIt could be a pivotal week for stocks.

That's what this is.\"\n\nA federal judge last week ordered Apple to create new software and take other steps to retrieve data from the locked phone, used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters, who was killed in a gun battle with police.\n\nThe company is fighting the order, arguing that creating such a key will jeopardize the security of all iPhones. The company's formal legal arguments are expected Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department's maneuvers over the past week have prompted Apple supporters to suggest the case is as much about putting political pressure on Apple and influencing the broader policy debate on encryption as it is about getting data from Farook's phone.\n\nThe Justice Department launched its unusually public campaign to force Apple's hand by publicizing the court order itself, which normally would have been under seal, according to legal experts. Then, on Friday, the Justice Department filed additional court papers that repeated its legal arguments and criticized the company's resistance as a \"brand marketing strategy.\" The government acknowledged that the Friday filing was \"not legally necessary.\"\n\nApple responded hours later by holding a conference call with reporters -- a rare move by a generally reticent company that is accustomed to making news rather than reacting to it. That was followed early Monday by a public blog post and an internal email to employees arguing the company's case.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has actively solicited victims of the shooting to join its case against Apple.\n\nFarook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, destroyed their personal phones before carrying out the Dec. 2 shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California, which killed 14 and wounded 22. Authorities believe the couple was inspired by the Islamic State. The phone at issue is an iPhone 5c issued to Farook by San Bernardino County in his role as a health inspector.\n\nDigital Security Commission\n\nThe case has revived interest on Capitol Hill in pursuing legislation to address the problem of what law enforcement officials call \"going dark\" -- where tight digital security prevents them from accessing the data of criminal suspects.\n\nThe idea of setting up a commission -- which may be a prelude to a broader legislative solution -- is not new, although a political resolution of the data privacy and encryption debate has proven elusive for many years.\n\nA digital security commission comprising technology, business and law enforcement experts has been proposed by Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, to help break the impasse over encryption.\n\nThe bipartisan pair is scheduled to unveil details of legislation that would create a panel at a Washington event on Wednesday.\n\nApple indicated it would work with a commission or panel of experts to discuss the matter further.\n\n\"Apple would gladly participate in such an effort,\" the company wrote in the Monday post on its website addressing questions about the case (http://apple.co/1QthT10).\n\nThe company could not be immediately reached for further comment.\n\nThe Justice Department has pushed back on framing the dispute as an encryption issue, insisting that it is only trying to get past the lock screen on one phone. Apple has argued that while it is technically possible to bypass the security features of the iPhone by building a new operating system, such a move would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nBipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee late Friday invited Apple's Cook and FBI Director James Comey to testify at an upcoming hearing on encryption, though no date was set.\n\nSenators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat of the Senate Intelligence Committee respectively, have long said they intend to introduce legislation that would force a company to be able to grant authorities access to a suspect's data, though a bill has not yet materialized.\n\nSome victims of the attack will file a legal brief in support of the U.S. government's attempt to force Apple to unlock the phone, a lawyer representing the victims told Reuters on Sunday.", "Apple's resistance to the FBI's request for an iPhone hacking tool can be hard to evaluate because the dispute is taking place on three levels: technical, legal, and policy. None of these is necessarily more important than any other, and focusing on just one or two presents a skewed view of what's going on.\n\nOn the technical level, we now know that Apple could do what the FBI wants, but the company is tremendously worried that any such technology would escape into the wild. It's one thing to create a digital tool, but an entirely different thing to prevent it from being stolen, subverted, or simply copied. Since this tool could subvert the otherwise unbreakable (as least as far as is known) encryption embedded in the iPhone's Secure Enclave coprocessor, its creation would undermine the privacy of millions of iPhone users.\n\nBecause there's no actual law requiring Apple to comply or, conversely, protecting Apple from such requests, the FBI is relying on the All Writs Act of 1789. That Act has been used in similar surveillance-related cases in the past, but it's inherently vague, which means that lawyers and judges could wrangle about the specifics for a long time.\n\nWhen it comes to policy, it seems clear that the FBI is using this high-profile case of domestic terrorism as an opportunity to further its real goal, which is to be able to gain lawful access to evidence from any smartphone or digital device. And while Apple denies that it's resisting for marketing reasons, given that Apple is a for-profit business, it's impossible to know how much of its stance stems from being the right thing to do versus being a competitive advantage or marketing point.\n\nI'm coming down on Apple's side because I don't believe the FBI understands the technology well enough to appreciate Apple's argument about the impossibility of keeping a digital genie bottled up. I also don't see weakening iPhone security as a long-term win, given that it's far too easy for any interested organization to create, distribute, and use unbreakable encryption software. While I can't claim sufficient experience to comment on the legal issues, I dislike the way the FBI is using this case to push its agenda, and while Apple sometimes employs its commitment to privacy in ways that aren't entirely fair to competitors, that's a far lesser sin.\n\nWith all that said, here are the ExtraBITS we've published since my original coverage. They paint a fuller picture of what's happening and are well worth reading if you're interested in this case.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft CEOs Back Apple -- Twitter doesn't lend itself to subtlety or nuance, but Google CEO Sundar Pichai used a 5-part tweet to weigh in on Apple CEO Tim Cook's open letter to customers about the FBI's request that Apple create a hacking tool to brute force an iPhone passcode in the San Bernardino terrorism case. Pichai essentially signed on to Apple's position, saying that Google builds secure products and complies with legal orders to hand over data when possible, but simultaneously expressing concern that requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data could be a troubling precedent. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also commented, though less directly, by retweeting a post from Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith that summarized the firm's anti-backdoor position via a linked statement from the Reform Government Surveillance group, of which Microsoft is a member.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nTim Cook's Open Letter Prompted by the FBI Going Public -- Apple's spat with the FBI over building a cracking tool for an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino terrorism case has taken an interesting turn. The New York Times reports that while Apple had asked the FBI to file its request under seal, the government chose instead to make it public. That supports the theory that the FBI is using this high-profile case of domestic terrorism to pressure Apple into compromising the security of its products. Faced with this PR onslaught, Apple saw no choice but to take its case for supporting encryption to the public in Tim Cook's open letter. Sadly, this fight between the FBI and Apple could have been avoided had the assailant's employer used standard mobile device management tools to maintain passcode control over the work iPhone in question.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nA Forensics Expert's View into the FBI's Request -- The more we learn about the Apple/FBI dustup, the more clear it has become that this is actually a subtle and dangerous game of chess. The latest insight comes from Jonathan Zdziarski, considered to be among the world's leading experts in iOS-related forensics. In a blog post, Zdziarski explains the difference between \"lab services\" and developing an \"instrument.\" Apple has provided one-off lab services in the past to help law enforcement recover data when required by law. But developing an instrument is a tremendously involved, verified, documented, tested, and validated process. It would require significant resources and would result in the hacking tool being made public and usable by any law enforcement or intelligence agency -- along with foreign governments and criminal organizations. That's why Apple is resisting.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nDetails Emerge in Dispute between Apple and FBI -- In a call with reporters, as covered by TechCrunch, Apple executives clarified a couple of points in the ongoing dispute between the company and the FBI. First, any tool that met the FBI's desire for software that would enable the brute force cracking of an iPhone's passcode would also work on newer iPhones with iOS 8 or iOS 9 and a Secure Enclave coprocessor. That's because the data in the Secure Enclave is encrypted by the passcode, which provides access to everything on an iPhone. Second, the FBI apparently reset the Apple ID password for the account associated with the iPhone right after taking the iPhone into custody. That prevented any further automatic iCloud backups, which Apple could have turned over to the government.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nApple Answers More Questions about FBI Court Order -- As speculation swirls about the implications of Apple resisting the FBI's request for help accessing an iPhone used by one of the assailants in the San Bernardino terrorism case, the company has posted another public statement answering some of the questions that have arisen. In particular, Apple explains why it objects to the government's court order, whether or not the FBI's request is technically feasible, why such a technical solution could not be contained, and more. One particular note -- despite what has appeared in the media, Apple says it has never previously unlocked iPhones. Prior to iOS 8, Apple had extracted unencrypted data from locked iPhones for law enforcement, using a technique that didn't require them to be unlocked. The encryption in iOS 8 and iOS 9 makes that impossible now.", "When it comes to the dispute over San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone, new findings show that public support is on the side of the Justice Department.\n\nData from the Pew Research Center show that the majority of Americans -- 51 percent -- think Apple should cooperate with a federal court order.

He said the U.S. attorney in the case, Eileen Decker, sought his help. Larson said he will file a brief supporting the Justice Department before March 3.\n\nThe victims \"have questions that go simply beyond the criminal investigation ... in terms of why this happened, how this happened, why they were targeted, is there anything about them on the iPhone -- things that are more of a personal victim\" view, Larson said.\n\nGeorge Valasco, whose 27-year-old niece Yvette Velasco was killed in the shooting, said his brother -- Yvette's father -- agreed to be named in the brief.\n\n\"Frankly it's difficult to understand why Apple would not jump at the opportunity to help uncover whatever information the phone may contain,\" according to a family statement. \"We're not talking about an ordinary case here -- this is an act of terrorism, where 14 Americans lost their lives, and many more were seriously injured. It's potentially a matter of national security, where other Americans' safety could be at risk.\"\n\nAn appeal by victims in the case gives the Justice Department additional support in a case that has sparked a national debate over digital privacy rights and national security interests. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym in California ordered Apple last week to assist investigators by creating specialized software that would let the FBI rapidly test random passcode combinations to try to unlock the iPhone and view data stored on it.\n\nThe county-issued iPhone 5C was used by Syed Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people at an office holiday party in December before they died in a gun battle with police. The government said they had been at least partly inspired by the Islamic State.\n\nThe couple physically destroyed two personal phones so completely that the FBI has been unable to recover information from them.\n\nFarook had worked as a county health inspector. Larson said the government has a strong case because of Farook's diminished privacy interests as a \"dead, murderous terrorist\" and because the phone was owned by his employer, the county government. \"You're weighing that against the interest of enforcement in an investigation and the victims and their interest in obtaining this knowledge,\" he said.\n\nGregory Clayborn, whose 27-year-old daughter, Sierra, died in the attack, said he hasn't been asked to join the case but believes Apple is obligated to unlock the phone.\n\n\"This makes me a little bit angry with Apple,\" Clayborn said. \"It makes me question their interest in the safety of this country.\"\n\nClayborn said he owns Apple products and understands why the company wouldn't want the FBI to have the software to access anyone's phones. But unlocking one for the FBI, he said, is \"as simple as it gets.\"\n\nLarson, a former U.S. district judge, said he knew Pym, the magistrate, and described her as an \"extraordinary jurist\" when she argued in his courtroom as a then-federal prosecutor.\n\nApple Inc. CEO Tim Cook acknowledged in a letter to employees earlier Monday that that \"it does not feel right\" to refuse to help the FBI, but he said to do so would threaten data security for millions by creating essentially a master key that could later be duplicated and used against other phones.\n\n\"We have no tolerance or sympathy for terrorists,\" Cook wrote in an early morning email. \"When they commit unspeakable acts like the tragic attacks in San Bernardino, we work to help the authorities pursue justice for the victims.\"\n\nCook's email came hours after FBI director James Comey said in an online post that Apple owes it to the San Bernardino victims to cooperate and the FBI \"can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead.\"\n\nApple's supporters planned to protest the FBI's demands on Tuesday evening outside Apple's stories in about 50 cities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Hong Kong. In Washington, people were being asked to protest outside the FBI's headquarters.\n\nAccording to a new survey by the Pew Research Center, 51 percent of Americans said Apple should unlock the iPhone to assist the ongoing FBI investigation, while 38 percent said Apple should not to ensure the security of other users' information. Eleven percent gave no opinion. The telephone survey was conducted Feb. 18 through Feb. 21 among 1,002 adults.", "THE government and Apple have chosen interesting ground on which to contest the limits of government access to data on mobile devices. The case involves an F.B.I. request for Apple's assistance in opening a phone once carried by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife was responsible for the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 22 wounded.\n\nOn one level, this should be comfortable space for the government. First, the phone is owned by the County of San Bernardino, which issued it to Mr. Farook, an employee of its health department. The county, as Apple's customer, has no problem having its phone opened. Second, Mr. Farook and his wife were killed in a gun battle with the police early last December. Under the law, dead people have no privacy rights.\n\nBut Apple is making a stand because the government wants it to create something against its will: code that would disable a feature that erases all content after 10 failed password attempts. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, has said that if this happens, the floodgates will open to similar law enforcement requests, putting customers' data at risk. And not just in the United States: Apple supporters have raised concerns that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are likely to follow suit.\n\nMr. Cook's position is hyperbolic, in our view. But beyond the legal case, there is an ethics issue unfolding here.\n\nUntil 17 months ago, Apple held the key that could override protections and open phones. Apple used this \"master key\" to comply with court orders in drug, kidnapping, murder and terrorism cases. There was no documented instance of this code getting out to hackers or to the government. So what was the problem Apple was trying to fix when it abruptly announced, in September 2014, that with its new iOS-8, \"Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants\"?\n\nSome believe that the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden of the National Security Agency's mass surveillance of phone and Internet communications stoked fears among Apple's customers that the government was spying on them. Perhaps an iPhone that even Apple couldn't unlock might allay such fears, while also helping sales by offering more privacy and security.\n\nBut Mr. Snowden claimed that the N.S.A. was capturing some Americans' Internet traffic from overseas, not that the agency was hacking into smartphones. Moreover, Apple's position on privacy seems at odds with its own strategy of encouraging customers to pay to store personal data on iCloud, which is also vulnerable to hackers.\n\nApple partisans also argue that the company is trying to protect privacy in places like China, where governments could demand access to phones belonging to dissidents. But Apple could refuse those requests, or have China make them through the State Department, a means of insulating itself from unreasonable demands. That is often how the United States asks for assistance from overseas corporations in investigations.\n\nApple and privacy advocates have framed this debate as the government wanting to \"create a back door\" into people's devices. But the Constitution protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. And for more than 200 years, the standard has been for law enforcement to obtain a warrant signed by a judge, based on probable cause.\n\nWhat the government is actually requesting here is that Apple restore a key that was available until late 2014. Complying with constitutionally legal court orders is not \"creating a back door\"; in a democracy, that is a front door.\n\nMr. Cook says Apple's ultimate goal is to provide customers \"safety\" from \"attack.\" But Mr. Cook does not seem to be talking about the kind of attack that took 14 lives in San Bernardino. Presumably, he means attacks from hackers or what he may view as government intrusion -- even when that intrusion is legal.\n\nThe phone in the San Bernardino case stopped uploading data to the cloud about six weeks before the killings. That suggests there may be information inside the device that was deliberately concealed. That could include the identities of terrorists who influenced or directed the attack; such information, if pursued, could prevent future plots. Or the iPhone might contain nothing of value. It is Apple's position that we should never know.\n\nThe ramifications of this fight extend beyond San Bernardino. Brittany Mills was a 29-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered in Baton Rouge, La. Apple says it can't comply with a search warrant and open her iPhone even though the police believe the identity of the killer is contained in her device.\n\nMs. Mills was an Apple customer. So were some of the people who died with iPhones in their pockets in the San Bernardino and Paris attacks. How is not solving a murder, or not finding the message that might stop the next terrorist attack, protecting anyone?\n\nGoogle, which owns the Android system, now indicates that it will follow Apple's lead. For those companies, and others like them, there is a sound argument in not wanting, even indirectly, to become an arm of the government. But when you are the two companies whose operating systems handle more than 90 percent of mobile communications worldwide, you should be accountable for more than just sales.", "When it comes to the dispute over San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone, new findings show that public support is on the side of the Justice Department.\n\nData from the Pew Research Center show that the majority of Americans -- 51 percent -- think Apple should cooperate with a federal court order.

Both sides feel they have a strong case.\n\nCook's email was turned into a public Q&A posted on the Apple website. In it, he highlights the \"outpouring of support we've received from across America\" since he formally - and publicly - refused to abide by a court order that required Apple to write a version of its mobile operating system so the FBI could unlock the phone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook.\n\nCook is certain that an open public debate on the matter will fall down in Apple's favor, given the increasingly personal information American citizens store on their phones and a general distrust of the federal government.\n\nAs such, he and Apple are painting the case as one that has far-reaching impacts. \"This case is about much more than a single phone or a single investigation,\" he wrote. \"At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people, and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone's civil liberties.\"\n\nThe FBI's Comey paints the opposite picture: that this is a rare and extraordinary case. \"The San Bernardino litigation isn't about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message,\" he wrote. \"It is about the victims and justice. Fourteen people were slaughtered and many more had their lives and bodies ruined. We owe them a thorough and professional investigation under law.\"\n\nInterestingly, both sides recognize in the middle of tearing down the other side that they may have hit an impasse that will require a large public debate to decide.\n\nCook specifically highlighted a proposal before the US Congress to create a special commission to look at the issue of encryption and privacy, which is at the heart of the matter. He wrote: \"We feel the best way forward would be for the government to withdraw its demands under the All Writs Act and, as some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms. Apple would gladly participate in such an effort.\"\n\nApple would likely gain more from Congress' general inability to achieve anything due to partisan in-fighting, but the FBI's Comey also lends some weight to the idea of taking the issue out of the boxing ring and into more institutional hands.\n\n\"Although this case is about the innocents attacked in San Bernardino, it does highlight that we have awesome new technology that creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure - privacy and safety,\" he wrote. \"That tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living. It also should not be resolved by the FBI, which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\"\n\nThere were, of course, some side-swipes by both sides: the FBI accusing Apple of putting marketing ahead of the country's security and Apple implying that the FBI is either incompetent or disingenuous when it caused the iCloud back-up of the phone in question to lock up.\n\nBut both sides appear to have realized that they are not going to reach a solution between themselves, and an endless public fight is going to rapidly make both of them look bad.\n\nJournalists: Crucial details in the @FBI v. #Apple case are being obscured by officials.

And most significant will be if the case represents a precedent.\n\nThere isn't credible polling data yet on how they would change support for the court order, but it is not hard to imagine that if the FBI's order was taken to be a legal precedent, that could lead to it being granted access to many more people's phones; then the balance of agreement could shift the other way. \u00ae", "Dan Kaminsky is an expert on DNS security - and he's saying: Patch right God damn now\n\nBig Blue has used its IBM InterConnect conference in Las Vegas to announce cooperative deals with Apple, VMware and GitHub, as the venerable commuting giant seeks to suck in more cloudy business.\n\n\"Businesses are adopting cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation, but they are still struggling to combine those cloud native services with existing apps and data which reside on-premises,\" said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM Cloud Application Services.\n\n\"Our objective is to drastically simplify how developers discover and connect disparate apps and services, so enterprises can unlock the value of their existing IT and more rapidly capture the value of the cloud. This helps enable developers to discover and re-use the best capabilities, wherever they reside.\"\n\nOn the Swift side, IBM is expanding the Swift Sandbox announced in December to help coders use Apple's open source programming language in cloud instances.\n\nThey can also share and develop their designs in a new Swift Package Catalog that IBM will host, or write for Bluemix, IBM's platform-as-a-service system and run them in OS X and Linux on a new open source web server dubbed Kitura.\n\n\"Modern digital apps require a modern programming language. Swift is easy to learn, reliable, fast and interactive, the key traits that CIOs look for when building the next generation of enterprise mobile apps,\" said Michael Gilfix, VP of IBM MobileFirst Offering Management.\n\n\"Swift on the Cloud is an opportunity for enterprises to radically simplify the development of end-to-end applications and therefore reach new levels of productivity.\"\n\nIt's not just Apple feeling the love - there's a new deal with VMware that will bring the firm's software-defined data center architecture to IBM's cloud systems, along with the virty firm's vRealize Automation and vCenter management tools.\n\n\"This partnership, an extension of our 14-year-plus relationship with IBM, demonstrates a shared vision that will help enterprise customers more quickly and easily embrace the hybrid cloud,\" said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VMware.\n\n\"Our customers will be able to efficiently and securely deploy their proven software-defined solutions with sophisticated workload automation to take advantage of the flexibility and cost effectiveness of IBM Cloud.\"\n\nThe two firms are also going to partner up on selling hybrid cloud services to enterprise buyers and will add VMware's vSphere, NSX and Virtual SAN to Big Blue's 45 worldwide data centers. These won't be on a pay-as-you-go tariff, but instead on a monthly-based consumption pricing system.\n\nTeaming with IBM goes some way to explaining why VMware last month pulled the pin on its ambition to build a cloud capable of rivalling Big Blue's, or those of AWS, Google and Microsoft. IBM will give VMware scale and reach it could not afford to build, and therefore adds credibility to its hybrid cloud strategy.\n\nBut the tie-up will also raise eyebrows among the other, smaller, cloud operators VMware has courted as providers of hosted Virtzilla environments. Those outfits now have the biggest of big competitors, which has been handed a privileged position by their supplier/partner.\n\nThe deal's also curious in light of VMware's previous cloud strategy to pipe in services from other clouds. That plan started with Google storage services but has not, as expected, seen VMware pipe in services from other clouds as the company's one-time cloud Czar Bill Fathers promised us last year.\n\nGitHub too is getting into bed with Big Blue, with the code repository's pricey Enterprise offering now being hosted on IBM's Bluemix as a dedicated service for hybrid and private cloud users.

But he was sure to mention that Facebook would work with the FBI. \"If there's any content that's promoting terrorism or sympathising with ISIS or anything like that,\" said Zuckerberg, \"we'll ... get those people off the service.\"\n\n(Remember that it was erroneously reported that the shooters used Facebook to post incendiary content.)\n\nWhile it's not a huge surprise that Zuck sides with Tim Cook -- and Google chief Sundar Pichai -- it is rather interesting to see if and how the Facebook founder's statement will be received by Facebook users. A new study out today by the Pew Research Center says that a majority of Americans believe that Apple should help the FBI unlock the iPhone. Of the 1002 adults polled last week, 51 per cent said Apple should work with the FBI; 38 per cent said Apple should not cooperate; and 11 per cent didn't know.\n\nCook has proposed that an independent commission review the case to settle what is now essentially a giant circle of pointing fingers, which almost certainly could have been avoided if local police hadn't accidentally reset the iCloud password in question.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nHave you subscribed to Gizmodo Australia's email newsletter?

Another 38 percent say Apple should not help; 11 percent say that they don't know.\n\nBut before we go any further, take note of an important technicality: Pew asked people whether Apple should unlock the iPhone, which is not actually what the court requested. Rather, the court asked Apple to help the FBI bypass an auto-erase function that would be triggered after 10 incorrect password attempts. Pew Senior Researcher Alec Tyson defended the poll's wording, telling NPR that \"this reflects our best judgment about the clearest way to ask the question.\"\n\nAmong Americans who support Apple's decision, the greatest percentage -- 43 percent -- are between age 18 and 29.

I'd hoped that it would, at last, satisfy my yearning for a perfect iPad stylus, and it did: The Pencil is an incredible tool for artists, drafters, and calligraphers alike.\n\nBut unlike a real-world pencil or pen, the Pencil is also a competent navigational tool on the iPad Pro's screen. You can tap on brushes or buttons with it, of course, but also perform any of iOS's other finger-based gestures: swiping menus in or out, selecting text, and scrolling lists.\n\nI've never been much of a navigational-stylus-on-the-iPad person, so it initially surprised me when I began using my Pencil outside of traditional drawing and sketching apps. But on the iPad Pro, it feels right -- especially if you're switching between sketching a drawing or altering a photo with the Pencil to another app. If I'm looking at Google Images in one Split View pane while drawing in the other, it's easy to move the Pencil from side to side.\n\nI also found it hugely useful at times when I couldn't sit or stand at a desk: When I first got the iPad Pro, I was recovering from an illness, and spent about a week working on the couch. When reading, the Pro's screen was often just a hair too far away or awkwardly angled for me to scroll or tap with my fingers alone, but the angle and length of the Pencil made it the perfect tool to use on the screen while I rested.\n\nUnfortunately, whether by bug or intentional design, the Pencil's navigational prowess appears to have vanished in the iOS 9.3 public betas. With 9.3, you can no longer scroll or manipulate text; the only places the Pencil works are on canvas or when pressing digital buttons.\n\nWhether by bug or intentional design, the Pencil's navigational prowess appears to have vanished in iOS 9.3\n\nNormally, I don't write about beta bugs and features, because it's a beta: There are always bugs, and features change. But this functionality is important enough that I wanted to talk about it before Apple submits its final 9.3 release. It could be a bug, yes: But several betas in, we've seen fixes for Smart Connector keyboards and new features, and the Pencil remains crippled. Which makes me think, more and more, that this is a conscious decision on the part of Apple's engineering team. (I did reach out to the company about the issue, and will update if and when I receive a response.)\n\nI can partially understand the reasoning behind the change: Navigation isn't one of the Pencil's primary uses, and you've never needed a stylus to use an iOS device, after all.\n\nBut the fact remains that the Pencil's owners use those navigation options, and frankly, the idea that Apple would take away functionality that people have come to expect and depend on is a significant hit to usability and overall experience.\n\nThere's no reason to limit functionality on the Pencil.\n\nWorse, it makes the Pencil useless for video and audio editing, creative pursuits that I'd hoped to explore further on the iPad Pro. I'd initially enjoyed editing and cutting several videos in iMovie for iOS with the help of the Pencil; now, you can only select and drag clips. You can't cut a clip with the downward swipe gesture, nor can you scroll the timeline.\n\nIf it's not interfering with the iOS touch architecture -- and according to third-party developers I've talked with, it shouldn't be -- there's no reason to limit functionality on the Pencil.\n\nI'm not the only one upset about this issue. Earlier this month, Relay.fm founder and host Myke Hurley wrote about his concerns. Stephen Hackett, Relay co-founder (and iMore contributor), is also concerned:\n\nRemoving the functionality relegates the Pencil to just a creative tool, not a utility that can be used system-wide. While I appreicate that it is a great option for drawing, for those of us who wanted to use it outside of that box, it feels like a bad change in direction.\n\nThe Pencil has also been hugely beneficial for those with RSI (Repetitive Strain Injuries), including Hello Internet host and YouTube producer CGP Grey. He told iMore:\n\nI've been dealing with RSI for years, and I've found that nothing works as well for managing that [on the Mac] as Wacom pen tablets. Anyone used to a pen tablet -- including most professional digital artists on a Mac -- would find it crazy and infuriating if Wacom didn't let them manipulate interface elements.\n\nMost of my work is on iOS now, especially after the introduction of the Pro; as such, being able to use the pen to navigate the iOS interface is a huge deal for me, because using the iPad with my hands held like I'm fingerpainting isn't good for them. It causes strain if I'm working on the tablet all day. I was on the beta, but downgraded back because not being able to use the pen for all interface elements got uncomfortable, fast. Switching back and forth between fingers and pen seemed worse than either alone.\n\nThis is a plea to the development team at Apple: There's still time to add these Pencil features back for the final iOS 9.3 release. They're not only useful for the folks that just draw or sketch with the Pencil -- they also provide functionality for video and audio editing, and offer priceless accessibility for those who have trouble with their hands.", "In its battle with Apple over an extremist's iPhone, the FBI says neither the company nor anyone else has anything to fear. Although they want to compel assistance from Apple to unlock a phone used by San Bernardino mass shooter Syed Farook, officials say the techniques they propose are limited in scope and pose no risk to the privacy of other iPhone users.\n\nSecurity experts say it's not so simple.\n\n\"It's a very dangerous proposition to claim that this capability could not be re-used,\" said Will Ackerly, chief technology officer at Virtru, a computer security firm he co-founded after working 8 years at the National Security Agency.\n\nFederal prosecutors have asked a court to force Apple to produce special software that would help the FBI guess the passcode to an iPhone found in Farook's car. Federal officials say Apple will be free to destroy that software once the iPhone is open to investigators.\n\nApple argues it's unrealistic to think that governments, both in the U.S. and overseas, won't ask to use the same program again in other cases. Ackerly and other experts echoed that concern. And on technical grounds, experts say, it may simply be impossible to keep the program from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nTrue, some experts say Apple CEO Tim Cook is exaggerating when he says the government wants the company to create a \"backdoor\" into otherwise secure information held on iPhones. It might be closer to say the government wants to require Apple to help pick the lock to the front door. Even that approach, however, could still pose broader dangers.\n\nEssentially, the FBI wants Apple to write a program that disables some iPhone security features so that federal computer experts could guess the phone's passcode by \"brute force.\" Unlocking the phone with the passcode automatically decodes encrypted files. In particular, the FBI wants to disable a \"self-destruct\" mechanism that could render the phone unreadable after 10 bad guesses, as well as an enforced delay of up to an hour between incorrect passcode attempts.\n\nU.S. officials say their precautions would prevent anyone else -- governments and criminal hackers included -- from re-using that bypass software on other phones.\n\nFirst, the government says Apple can design the program to work only when it recognizes Farook's iPhone, by checking the unique identifying code assigned to each device Apple makes. The iPhone won't respond if the program doesn't contain a cryptographic signature that verifies the software was created by Apple, the government said in its court filing.\n\nAuthorities say the program can be loaded onto the iPhone's temporary memory, so it will disappear once the iPhone is turned off. As an additional precaution, the government says Apple can design the program to let investigators try different passcodes by submitting them electronically, so that Apple can keep physical control over the iPhone while the special program is deployed.\n\n\"Compliance with the order presents no danger to any other phone,\" prosecutors said Friday in a court document signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Wilkinson.\n\nThose measures should prevent anyone from getting their hands on the special software or re-using it on another phone, agreed Chris Eng, vice president of research at Veracode, a computer security firm. \"From a technical perspective, I believe what's being described is completely possible.\"\n\nEng said he'd be more concerned if the government was seeking a true \"backdoor\" -- a change in Apple's encryption algorithm that would let others break the code. That's not what the FBI is pursuing in this case, he said.\n\nBut other experts warned of technical risks in the government's plan. They said it would be difficult, but not impossible, to reverse-engineer the Apple program so it could work with other phones. Software is easy to copy, despite the government's reassurances, said Bruce Schneier, a security expert and chief technology officer for Resilient Systems. \"That's the nature of software.\"\n\nThe program wouldn't work on another iPhone unless a hacker modified it to recognize that device, and that would require forging Apple's digital signature, said Steve Bellovin, a computer science and security expert at Columbia University. But he said it's not beyond the realm of possibility that sophisticated hackers or a foreign government could steal Apple's signature code.\n\nThough Apple is known for guarding its secrets closely, a senior executive said recent history shows that no companies are immune to hacking -- either by outsiders or an employee who's been bribed to steal secrets. The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also asserted that an outsider wouldn't need Apple's digital signature to modify the program so it works with another phone.\n\nAny risk that the software could be stolen or modified will increase because other law enforcement agencies are likely to ask Apple to re-use that tool in the future, Apple contends. \"Law enforcement agents around the country have already said they have hundreds of iPhones they want Apple to unlock if the FBI wins this case,\" the company said in a statement Monday.\n\nUsing the software even once could give authorities or outsiders new clues to how Apple's security features work, potentially exposing vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the future, Ackerly said. If Apple allows federal investigators to submit passwords through a remote connection, he added, that could open the phone to intrusion -- including efforts to copy the program.\n\nThe government has promised it won't try to copy Apple's software, of course, and doing so would risk a judge's ire or even legal penalties.\n\nComputer forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski raised another possibility: If authorities find anything on the iPhone that they use in court -- for example, to identify and prosecute any accomplices who aided the San Bernardino shooters -- then Apple could be required to explain its software in court. A judge might also permit defense attorneys and their experts to study the program.\n\nThere's a strong likelihood \"this tool won't be used once, but many times,\" Zdziarski said in an email, adding that each time could expose the software to copying or misuse.\n\nAssociated Press", "WASHINGTON -- Some of the victims and their families in the mass shootings in southern California are openly supporting the U.S. government's position that Apple Inc. be required to help the FBI hack into a locked iPhone in the terrorism investigation.\n\nA Los Angeles attorney, Stephen Larson, says he plans to file a brief in the legal battle on behalf of at least several families of victims and other employees in the shootings in San Bernardino, California. Larson is a former federal judge who says he was asked by federal prosecutors to take on the case.\n\nLarson says the victims want to know what's on the county-issued iPhone used by the gunman, what might pertain to them and why they were targeted. They also want to understand how the shootings could have happened.", "Even in the volatile world of technology stocks, it was a stunning moment for investors.\n\nShares of the tech companies LinkedIn and Tableau Software dropped like an anvil from a cliff early this month after the firms reported disappointing growth forecasts. Their stocks plunged more than 40 percent in a single day and sparked a sell-off in other tech stocks as well.\n\n\"I don't remember seeing a reaction as violent as that since the dot-com bubble burst\" in 2000, said Pat O'Hare, chief market analyst at Briefing.com, an investment research site.\n\nThe sentiment among many investors and industry watchers was dire: A new tech bubble was on the brink of bursting, the days of sky-high valuations were over, rapid growth had stalled.\n\nBut anyone speculating that the latest sell-off meant the bubble had burst again for the tech sector had guessed wrong -- at least for now.\n\nMany technology shares shrugged off the LinkedIn-Tableau setback and have rebounded in the last two weeks. As a group, they're still in the red so far this year but aren't doing much worse than the stock market overall, which has had a rough start. Tech stocks also are holding up better than some other battered sectors, such as financial and healthcare stocks.\n\nAlthough the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index is down 6.2 percent this year, the S&P Information Technology index is off 7.1 percent.\n\nThe pullback includes the widely followed FANG stocks -- Facebook (down 0.1 percent this year), Amazon.com (down 20.9 percent), Netflix (down 22 percent) and Google parent Alphabet (down 7.2 percent). Another tech leader, Apple, is down 8.8 percent.\n\nTech stocks were one of the strongest sectors in 2015 as the overall market basically moved sideways. This year, as plunging oil prices and fears of slower economic growth worldwide pushed the overall market lower, tech stocks also were hit as many investors sold to take profits from the shares' 2015 rally.\n\nDespite the losses this year, Amazon.com is still up 41 percent over the last 12 months. Facebook is up 31.7 percent and Microsoft has a 19.1 percent gain.\n\nTech stocks by their nature often are volatile whether the companies are involved in hardware, apps, data storage or social media. In many cases the companies are relatively young with little or no earnings or they're competing in fast-growing emerging markets.\n\nInvestors often are betting that the companies will enjoy rapid sales growth that eventually will produce sustained profits. But there's tremendous risk because if there's any sign that the growth will be less than expected, the stocks can suffer.\n\nThe slide in tech stocks in the first six weeks of this year effectively put many of the stocks on sale, prompting some professional money managers and other investors to buy them again and help the sector rebound.\n\nIn fact, analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence recently raised their rating on tech stocks partly due to \"attractive valuations\" and because they believe Wall Street's estimates for many of the companies' earnings growth this year \"are overly pessimistic.\"\n\nThe headlines generated by the shortfalls at LinkedIn, Tableau Software and other firms also \"resulted in the investing public becoming overly negative on the technology sector,\" said Scott Kessler, a tech analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nStill, investors are being very selective about which tech stocks they buy this time around. The stocks \"are cheaper but I wouldn't call them cheap,\" said Deborah Koch, co-manager of the Northern Trust Technology Fund.\n\nMany tech stocks are still struggling to climb back to their once lofty levels. For example, chipmaker Intel is still down 16.7 percent this year, activity tracker Fitbit is down a whopping 47.3 percent this year and cybersecurity firm FireEye has dropped 33 percent.\n\n\"I don't think we're seeing a mass bubble popping in the technology sector,\" O'Hare said. \"You are seeing targeted popping of some high 'price-to-earnings~ multiple stocks that was probably overdue.\n\n\"This market no longer is willing to pay for growth at any price,\" he said. \"People are trying to search for bargains but also they want quality growth.\"\n\nMuch of the tech sector concern over the last few weeks stems from weaker economic growth worldwide, which means less corporate spending for information-technology goods and services.\n\n\"There is no question there has been a downtick in global IT spending,\" Koch said. \"Tech is very sensitive to economic growth.\"\n\nAmong the hardest hit: The stock market's newest -- and thus most unproven -- companies. Many of the firms that had their initial public offerings last year are now trading below their IPO prices, including Fitbit, Columbia Pipeline Group and payment-processing firm First Data.\n\nThe U.S. dollar's strength also has been a head wind for many tech companies because their overseas sales in foreign currencies convert to fewer dollars, O'Hare said.\n\nThat has led many investors to focus on the \"legacy\" tech stocks such as Facebook, Alphabet and Apple that have solid histories of sales and earnings growth.\n\n\"We've leaned a bit more into legacy companies,\" Koch said. \"They have much more reasonable valuations\" relative to their growth prospects, she said.\n\nBut not every investor is preoccupied by the current volatility in tech stocks.\n\nGavin Baker, manager of Fidelity Investments' OTC Portfolio Fund, said he maintains a long-term focus on \"investing in great companies that are at the center of multi-decade trends.\"\n\nAlthough concerns about world economies, oil prices and China are weighing on stocks today, Baker said, \"I don't expect that to have any impact on the five- or 10-year outlook for e-commerce, Internet advertising or solar power.\"", "Fitbit, the maker of wearable health- tracking devices, forecast revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analysts' estimates, saying the global introduction of their newest watches may push sales later into the year.\n\nSales in the first quarter will be in the range of $420 million to $440 million, the San Francisco-based company said Monday in a statement. That compared with the average analyst projection of $485 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFitbit has been the leading seller of wearable fitness trackers, but investors are concerned that competition from the likes of Apple, Samsung Electronics, and Xiaomi may blunt the company's growth. Fitbit's market share fell to 22 percent in the third quarter of 2015 from 33 percent a year earlier, according to IDC. In addition to rivalry from the tech giants, companies such as Fossil Group and Under Armour have developed connected fitness devices.\n\n\"The competition has always been there,\" said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, who has an outperform rating on Fitbit. \"They're going to have to live with a lot of that competition.\"\n\nShares declined 16 percent in extended trading. Earlier, the stock rose 5.9 percent to $16.52 at the close in New York.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue almost doubled to $711.6 million, Fitbit said in the statement. Analysts on average projected $648 million. Profit before certain items was 35 cents a share, compared with the 25 cents analysts predicted.\n\nThe company said it sold 8.2 million connected health and fitness devices in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fitbit has been expanding its product lineup and now sells eight devices, including two recently announced models, Alta and Blaze.\n\n\"The timing of shipments into sales channels may result in the majority of reorders, especially for Alta, coming in the second quarter of 2016,\" Fitbit said in the statement.\n\nThe decline in Fitbit's shares, which have lost almost half of their value this year, are tied more to the expiration of a lockup on a secondary offering and a selloff in technology stocks than the underlying business, Seyrafi said.\n\nShares also took a hit last month after the introduction of Fitbit's Blaze, a smartwatch that features on-screen workouts and a connected GPS. Betty Chen, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said investors feared it would compete with the Apple Watch as an inferior product. But Chen says Fitbit purposefully focused on a few features for the Blaze to keep the price point around $200, a cheaper option than the Apple Watches.\n\n\"While we certainly do not want to discount smartwatches, Apple Watches in particular, consumers are telling us they find very different needs for those devices, and for now they find some smartwatches in the market very costly,\" said Chen, who has a buy rating on Fitbit.", "Adobe's suite of mobile tools has really exploded with functionality recently to take full advantage of the advancements in hardware and software.

Musk said there were domain issues in the way, a problem now apparently solved.\n\nIt's not clear, exactly, what caused the sudden change after so many years, or what Tesla may have had to pay to finally make the switch -- although we do know even brief lapses in domain occupancy can lead to big paydays.", "The website was used as a private email server until this week. Even though Tesla Motors has been around since 2003, its namesake inventor - Nikola Tesla, who died in 1943 - had cachet in certain circles well before then. For proof, see the domain name Tesla.com, which until this week was owned by a private party. The URL was registered way back in the early days of the Internet, in November of 1992. Today, Tesla.com will take you to the website for the California automaker.\n\nAccording to the International Business Times, before Tesla took control, the Tesla.com URL was owned by Stu Grossman, perhaps since 1992. The popularity of the Tesla name caused him some legal hassle in 2005, when Tesla Industries, Inc., a \"manufacturer of portable electronic ground power units,\" tried to get the domain. The company submitted a complaint to the National Arbitration Forum and said it should be allowed to use the name because, among other things, it was, \"known by the name \"Tesla\" by all branches of the U.S. military, certain foreign military, the U.S. Forestry Department, a number of police departments, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\" Grossman responded that that the word \"Tesla,\" is \"the standard SI unit of magnetic flux density, thus a generic term,\" and that a lot of companies use it. Grossman was able to keep the name and, well, we all know a different Tesla today.\n\nThis isn't the first time Tesla has had to deal with someone else bogarting the Tesla name (somewhat ironic, that). When the automaker started doing business in China, it had to use the name Tuosule for a short while because \"Tesla\" was registered there by a trademark troll in 2006. A deal of some sort was later reached and Tesla is proudly Tesla in China now. As for what might have transpired between Tesla and Grossman over the Tesla.com URL, no one is talking.\n\nRelated Video:", "You may or may not have seen it, so I'm going to point it out to you - Eco-Shift Power (ECOP) announced today it's going to be the supplier of LED lighting technologies to be used in a refit of a warehouse owned and operated by Central America's Farmazona Logistics.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal, not just because it represents revenue, but because this is the model of what to expect from ECOP going forward. James Brumley's coverage of the news today made the point pretty well - this is the new norm, and Eco-Shift Power is perfectly-positioned to capitalize on this paradigm shift in favor of LED lighting. It's simply more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nThing is, I don't even think today's news from Eco-Shift Power is the most exciting part of the ECOP story. This stock seems to have taken on a bullish life of its own, and technically sealed the deal today.\n\nJust for a little perspective on how far we've come with ECOP just since our introductory newsletter back on the 27th, the stock's up 100% since then. That's exciting, but it gets better.\n\nAs our nearby chart of ECOP shows, the 200-day moving average line (green) at $0.051 has stepped up to the plate as a support level; today's and yesterday's lows were right there, and the bulls were using it like a springboard. If the market has drawn a line in the sand there -- and it seems it has -- it's a great potential setup for yet another bullish leg.\n\nUnderscoring this idea is how we've seen a lot more bullish volume than bearish volume over the past three weeks.\n\nIn any case, as part of the research we were doing on Eco-Shift Power and the LED lighting market [as well as the research I was doing on another small cap trading idea we've been mulling for you - more on that in a moment], I had something of an epiphany that we can turn into an opportunity. That is, out of necessity, the electricity and electronics market is in the midst of a technical revolution not enough investors appreciate. The ones who see it and understand these changes stand to do very well in the foreseeable future. It's big enough I think we can deem it the second big megatrend we've spotted this year. (The first one was, amazingly enough, the LED lighting trend Eco-Shift Power is tapping into.)\n\nCalling a spade a spade, Tesla Motors (TSLA) and its sister company SolarCity (SCTY) -- both within the Elon Musk circle -- are the poster children for the new era of electricity creation and consumption. They've proven pretty much anything that can be conceived can be achieved, power and technology-wise.\n\nThe real unsung hero in all of this advancement, though, is the little ol' battery that does things like spin the motor of an electric vehicle, or store the energy created by solar power to use at a point in time when the sun isn't shining.\n\nThe good news is, the energy-density of batteries has been ramping up about 10% a year for the past couple of decades. It's good simply because our battery-powered devices have ramped up their consumption of electricity at about the same pace. The bad news is, the popular lithium-ion batteries providing power for your device (if you own a cellphone or laptop, you're almost definitely using a lithium-ion battery) are reaching their full potential in terms of storage capacity. This means if we want more power, we have to start using bigger batteries again. It's a step in the wrong direction.\n\nIt matters, because if we want to make the PowerWall at-home energy storage tool something functional and affordable at scale, we really can't quite do it with our current battery technologies.\n\nDitto for electric vehicles. The ones on the road today are admittedly pretty good, but if the EV phenomenon is going to take hold and become truly mainstream, these cars have to get a little more functional and a little less expensive.\n\nMy point is, as the world becomes more green-friendly (by necessity/legislation), we're going to have to get even better with not just the way we create electricity, but in the way we consume it and store it.\n\nBut that's not the big hook, so to speak.\n\nAre you familiar with the term \"peak oil\"? It's just a simple way of pointing out at some point in time the world's known supply of crude oil will start to fall, with production of refined oil falling with it... simply because it's not there to refine.\n\nWell, with the advent of electric vehicles and utility-scale battery storage systems, the term \"peak lithium\" is now being tossed around.\n\nAs is the case with oil, there's only so much lithium to tap, and now that the world has discovered the potential of lithium-ion batteries, its usage is starting to grow exponentially thanks to the proliferation of EVs, at-home battery units, etc. Citi expects the number of electric vehicles manufactures every year to be seven times greater than last year's production, sucking up a big chunk of the lithium supply. The rise of so-called \"smart grids\" is also going to put a strain on lithium supplies. Demand for lithium-ion batteries used in smart grids is projected to soar from last year's $1.5 billion worth to $6.0 billion worth by 2020.\n\nAnd those are just a few of the supply problems that could face sooner than later.\n\nIf Greentech Media's Tam Hunt is right -- and I believe he is -- the world's current production plans mean we only have about 17 years' worth of lithium left to use.\n\nNow, just like oil, I think we'll find more lithium in the meantime. It's unlikely we'll find leaps and bounds more, and even if we do it could be expensive and time-consuming to dig up. As evidence of this idea, though the world's never been better at digging up lithium, lithium prices are expected to rise 20% this year just due to the advent of electric cars.\n\nThe solution? We need to start getting a lot more voltage and storage capacity and re-usability out of our lithium-ion batteries. The big question is, how?\n\nIt's a question we're going to answer for you on Monday morning before the open when we present our new trading idea to you. You won't want to miss it. This company truly is ushering in the next evolution of battery technology, and there's a lot to be excited about. You'll see what we mean then.\n\nAnyway, the S&P 500 closed dead even today. As I feared yesterday, stocks could bounce around between some fairly important support and resistance levels for a while (although I did like the way the bulls managed to push their way back up from the lows). There's not even much point in showing you the chart of the index, so we won't. We will, however, show you a chart of the U.S. Dollar Index, since we've been talking about for a while in anticipation of a rollover. We saw it today. Take a look.\n\nNow one day doesn't make a trend, but considering the rebound effort stalled for three days this week and could never get over the established line in the sand at 97.2 -- not to mention the fact that today's bar was a rather big outside-day reversal -- I think we at least have to acknowledge the odds are working against the U.S. dollar at this time. That's good for oil and gold.\n\nWe'll look at it more in-depth next week. Don't forget though... Monday's edition will be coming in the morning, right around the market's open. This is a trading idea we're quite stoked about.", "Tesla.com has gone largely unused for years. This is what the site looked like only a few years ago. (via the Internet Archive)\n\nIf you want to find the websites for Ford, Chevy, or Dodge, you just add a \".com\" to the name. But not so for Tesla, which had long been unable to acquire the user-friendly Tesla.com domain name. That's finally changed, though no one is saying how.\n\nBloomberg reports that Tesla Motors acquired the Tesla.com domain from the Silicon Valley engineer who had owned it for 24 years, but had let it sit unused for much of that time.\n\nNow the URL redirects to TeslaMotors.com, the domain that Tesla has been using since it couldn't get the simpler name.\n\nAcquiring the domain opens the door for Tesla to create a catch-all website for its endeavors, which not only includes electric vehicles, but batteries via the Tesla Energy brand.\n\nBloomberg speculates that the new domain could lead the company to change its name to simply Tesla, a move that Musk said wasn't possible before due to domain issues.\n\nA lawyer who previously represented the original domain owner tells Bloomberg that over the years the man was approached by many people about acquiring the name.\n\n\"[The man] is an engineer and a big fan of Nikola Tesla,\" the lawyer said. \"He's had it, and now Tesla the auto company got it. I would surmise that this was a voluntary arrangement,\"\n\nA Tesla spokesperson declined to comment to Bloomberg on the domain change other than to say the company had acquired it.", "Elon Muskhas finally gotten his hands on the Tesla.com domain name that has been owned by a Silicon Valley engineer and virtually unused for 24 years.\n\nThe Tesla.com domain was owned by a Stu Grossman since 1992 and Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Musk had to settle for the slightly more cumbersome Teslamotors.com. A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed Friday that the company now has the domain. Punch Tesla.com into a browser and traffic is directed to Teslamotors.com.\n\nThe ever-persistent Musk got a domain that he wanted, which would give him the liberty to change the company's name to Tesla if he chooses to later on. When asked last year at the launch of Tesla Energy if he wanted to change the company's name to Tesla from Tesla Motors -- to reflect that the company's gigafactory would soon be building stationary batteries -- Musk said there were domain issues. Not anymore.\n\nThe move gives Tesla Motors a more broad handle on the Web just as the company is pushing beyond its electric-car business and is selling battery units for homes and power utilities.\n\nIt is not clear if Grossman sold the name that he bought for his own personal use and because of his affinity for inventor Nikola Tesla, said John Berryhill, an attorney in Pennsylvania who represented Grossman in a dispute about his right to the name with another company, Tesla Industries Inc., a decade ago. Grossman had been approached by many people about giving up the name, Berryhill said.\n\n\"Mr. Grossman is an engineer and a big fan of Nikola Tesla,\" Berryhill said. \"He's had it, and now Tesla the auto company got it. I would surmise that this was a voluntary arrangement,\"\n\nGrossman could not be immediately reached for comment.

The stock market is off to a bumpy start, but the volatility and uncertainty only make stock and sector selection even more important.\n\nIn terms of 2016 being a bounce-back year, SumZero asked which lagging 2015 sector (energy, materials, utilities, industrials or financials) will perform best this year. Respondents preferred the energy sector (35.5 percent) by a wide margin over financials (21.1 percent), which came in a distant second.

The instrument panel is made from brushed aluminum as a visual reminder of the GT's lightweight construction, and is also a structural member, Opel says. Following in the footsteps of automakers like BMW and Tesla Motors [NSDQ:TSLA], Opel also ditched exterior mirrors. The GT features a pair of monitors at the extreme ends of the dashboard that show feed from cameras mounted behind the front wheel arches.\n\nALSO SEE: 2017 Maserati Levante Leaked\n\nThat's not the only thoroughly modern touch on this sports car concept. There are no buttons anywhere in the cabin; everything is controlled by voice or through the central touchpad. Opel claims the car can gradually learn a driver's preferences by analyzing things like commands and control inputs, and eventually predict what he or she wants.\n\nThe instrument cluster includes two round re-configurable displays that mimic traditional gauges. The left display always shows speed and engine rpm, while the right display can be changed to show other information like a navigation map, or even g-force readouts. Based on technology that debuted on the Opel Monza concept at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, both displays can be backlit in different colors depending on the driver's mood, and display certain things in 3D.\n\nThe GT can even channel a bit of KITT and issue warnings like \"Don't overlook the motorcycle behind us!\" It takes backseat driving to a whole new level.\n\nStay tuned for the debut on the March 1 opening day of the Geneva Motor Show.

After years of financial delays, the casino resort's ocean-blue windows shimmer in the desert sunlight high above the Las Vegas Strip, a symbol of this city's faith that the money will always come rolling back.\n\nBrian Sandoval wasn't so lucky. He installed office trailers for workers when they were building the Cosmopolitan, but his job evaporated as construction work ground to a halt around the city. Out of work, he found himself in a Nebraska slaughterhouse where he knocked out cattle with a pneumatic gun.\n\n\"It was pretty traumatic before I got my first check,\" Sandoval said. With four children to support, he needed the money.\n\nSandoval, 40, who jokes about sharing the name of Nevada's governor, is back in Las Vegas now and working on the Strip, but it's not the same. Instead of construction, he tries to talk passing tourists into buying time shares.\n\n\"I know there's tons of money out there to be made,\" he said. \"But I haven't found it yet.\"\n\nSandoval's experience illustrates the gap between the nation's rebounding economy and the persistent insecurity still felt by many Americans as they consider who should replace President Obama in the White House. Few, if any, states have suffered more from the recession's lingering effects than Nevada, which holds its Democratic caucuses on Saturday and its Republican counterpart on Tuesday.\n\n\"A lot of people you might talk to on the street will probably tell you we're still in a recession,\" said Stephen Miller, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. \"We're still not quite back to where we were.\"\n\nOnce thought to be insulated from economic turmoil by its lucrative tourism industry, Nevada's unemployment rate and prevalence of underwater mortgages remain higher than national averages. Democratic candidates have hammered at pocketbook issues while campaigning here.\n\n\"No state in the country has suffered more from the greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street,\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said at a recent stop at a Las Vegas high school.\n\nSanders' focused message about income inequality and malfeasance by the country's banks could prove potent in a place still dusting itself off after a housing-bubble collapse that left large swaths of homes vacant.\n\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is counting on the state's black and Latino populations to help her achieve victory here, has insisted that she'll take an even tougher line on Wall Street to prevent another financial meltdown.\n\n\"Too many people lost their jobs, too many people lost their homes,\" she said in a union hall in a Las Vegas suburb.\n\nA poll released by CNN on Wednesday said 38% of Nevadans view the economy as the most important issue in the election, more than twice the amount for any other topic. That's a more intense focus than is found in most other parts of the country, but the economy remains among the top concerns for voters nationwide even if it no longer dominates as it did in the years immediately following the crash.\n\nEconomic problems are particularly fraught for Democratic candidates as they walk the line between celebrating Obama's successes and acknowledging the work that's left to be done.\n\nThe national unemployment rate fell to 4.9% in January, half of what it was during the depths of the recession.\n\n\"The job market is really improving,\" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington who previously worked in the Obama administration. \"We're finally seeing some wage gains.\"\n\nBut at the same time, salaries haven't kept pace with rising costs, Bernstein said, and underlying issues like jobs moving overseas and barriers for workers without college educations remain unaddressed. To top it off, many Americans watched with disgust as Wall Street bounced back faster than the rest of the country.\n\n\"There's a real sense that the system is rigged against them,\" he said. \"The people who played a tangible role in bringing us the Great Recession have fully recovered well before anybody else.\"\n\nLarry Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a union-backed think tank, described the economic situation as a breach of trust where average Americans have languished while wealth continues to be accumulated by the rich.\n\n\"People have lost faith in government,\" he said. \"People feel it's not working for them.\"\n\nThere are similar strains in Nevada, despite plenty of signs that the economy is recovering. Las Vegas welcomed a record 42.3 million visitors last year even though gambling revenues remain lower than before the recession, according to statistics from the city's convention authority.\n\nThe housing market, which cratered during the recession, is also more stable, said Dave Tina, president of the Nevada Assn. of Realtors. Fewer homes are being purchased with cash -- a sign that normal buyers are in the market, rather than investors trying to turn a profit -- and new developments are once again underway, he said.\n\n\"Every dead project that stopped is being rebuilt now,\" he said.\n\nThere's also been progress at attracting new businesses, sometimes fueled by hefty tax incentives. Electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc. plans to produce batteries at a new facility near Reno. A nearly vacant industrial park in North Las Vegas, a city that has long struggled with poverty, will be anchored by Faraday Future, a Chinese-backed company also building electric cars.\n\nSuch announcements, however, haven't quieted grumbling around the state that things haven't returned to the way they were, and perhaps never will.\n\n\"I don't think it will ever be the same,\" said Elena Silva, 39, who works in the spa at the Bellagio casino. \"People used to throw money left and right. Now they're more conservative.\"\n\nThere are also concerns that benefits from the new developments won't be widespread.\n\nDoug Smithson, 58, a retired firefighter who supports Sanders, said the only people excited about the Tesla factory are those who are already well off.\n\n\"Most people don't think that they're OK,\" he said. \"The middle class and the lower-middle class and the poor -- they're not optimistic.\"\n\nOther voters think Clinton can bring back a taste of the economic growth that was seen when her husband, Bill, was president.\n\n\"The economy was booming in the '90s with Clinton in the White House,\" said Barb Sadd, 70, who worked at a Los Angeles advertising firm before retiring in Pahrump, about an hour west of Las Vegas. \"It's going to boom again with Hillary -- they understand how to get things done.\"\n\nWhen Republicans descend on the state for their own caucuses on Tuesday, they'll be trying to harness some of the same economic dissatisfaction.\n\nCarol Michell, a retired legal secretary, said the economy is \"awful\" and she worries about her children's financial future.

It doesn't have a name yet, but a new group with ties to the conservative Koch brothers and a \"veteran Washington energy lobbyist\" is getting ready to spend big attacking electric vehicles, according to the Huffington Post. The new group will be funded by Koch Industries and lobbyist Charles Drevna, who was president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers group until last year. HuffPo says that the new group will spend \"about $10 million\" a year to, \"boost petroleum-based transportation fuels and attack government subsidies for electric vehicles.\"\n\nThe gist seems to be that Big Oil needs to change the \"energy narrative,\" something that Drevna and Koch Industries board member James Mahoney have been laying the groundwork for for a while now. Drevna has a history of speaking out against anything that will reduce the amount of gasoline Americans use, such as putting more than 10 percent ethanol into the nation fuel supply (the E15 debate).\n\nThe expected result of the new group will be ads and research that promote \"pro-petroleum transportation messages\" and attack subsidies for plug-in vehicles, HuffPo says. An affiliated group, the Institute for Energy Research, has already gotten its feet wet attacking Tesla and its Powerwall. The new anti-EV messages could start appearing this spring.\n\nWorth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health costs https://t.co/4li5E013Dj -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nTesla Motors CEO Elon Musk (after just writing, \"Sigh\"), Tweeted that if the new group wants to attack EV subsidies, it is, \"Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health costs.\" According to a report from the International Monetary Fund last year, fossil fuel companies are subsidized to the tune of $10 million every minute.\n\nRelated Video:", "We've all heard about the amazing potential of self-driving cars, and several automakers have predicted that they will have autonomous models on the road by 2020. But we also spent years hearing that by 2010, we'd have hover cars and moon colonies.\n\nIn this video segment, Sean O'Reilly and Vincent Shen talk about how feasible mass adoption of self-driving car technology actually is, and where the technology is today. Also, they look at Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), a company that's really pushing the limits with its autonomous driving features, and discuss whether its two-year timeline for deploying a fully self-driving vehicle is realistic or not.\n\nSean O'Reilly: So, how far along is this technology? Is this going to ... you kind of know what I'm getting at, because in the 1970s, we were told we would have moon colonies by now. You know what I mean? (laughs)\n\nVincent Shen: Of course, I understand. In terms of rubber meeting the road, right now, one company that I feel is pushing the limits in terms of what is possible with autonomous vehicles, and pushing the boundaries in terms of actually releasing these features and allowing owners of their cars to use them, is Tesla Motors. Tesla, through, I think it's their Model S and X, they have their autopilot, which has some really incredible features.\n\nO'Reilly: Now, that just works on the freeway right now, right?\n\nShen: Yeah. So, just to give you an idea: A lot of cars released these days have sensors that might warn you that there's something in your blind spot, or they might have adaptive headlights, so as you turn, the headlights will adjust to better illuminate your path. I feel like the autopilot program takes it to the next level. So, you have automatic steering. As you mentioned, on the highway, for example, you can take your hands off the wheel, and it will control it. It has this smart cruise control that basically uses the sensors to detect other cars and maintains its speed according to the traffic flow around you. And then, it also has automatic lane changes. So, if you're in the autopilot mode, you can just hit your blinker, and once it's safe, it'll automatically change to the next lane for you.\n\nO'Reilly: Oh, wow.\n\nShen: It'll warn you if your car's drifting into another lane, for example. So, those are some of the features that we're seeing right now. And, with the release of an update that Tesla pushed out last month, actually, it takes it to the next level. And a lot of that already sounds amazing, but now they have ...\n\nO'Reilly: So, this is just a software update that got ...\n\nShen: Exactly.\n\nO'Reilly: Wow, OK.\n\nShen: So, of course, you have to have hardware that can run this autopilot feature ...\n\nO'Reilly: But the sensors, from what you're telling me, are already in the car.\n\nShen: For certain models, yes. And if you're opted for that package. But, this update that was released last month, it has this really cool \"summon\" feature. Now, we're getting into parking.\n\nO'Reilly: Is this like the Batmobile in 1989's Tim Burton Batman? (laughs)\n\nShen: OK, yes, close. I'm glad that you just reminded me of that. In a sense, the summon feature, it'll park your car for you, parallel parking or in a perpendicular spot in a bigger parking lot. There's some limitations: You're only supposed to use it on private property, and you can only use it ...\n\nO'Reilly: To protect Gotham City. (laughs)\n\nShen: (laughs) Exactly. Or, within about 30 feet from the car. But ultimately, in tight spaces, you can get out of the car. For example, you get into a really tight garage, and you can't open the door to get out. You can get out of the car, line it up, hit a key fob or a smartphone app on your phone ...\n\nO'Reilly: Oh my gosh.\n\nShen: And it will pull the car in. And at the same time, you can summon it. So you can be inside your house, getting ready in the kitchen, having your coffee, hit a button, it'll open your garage door, start your car, back the car out, close the garage door, and be ready for you to go with the engine running the moment you walk out your door.\n\nO'Reilly: Wow. Which is handy in a blizzard.\n\nShen: Exactly. And, like I said, there's some limitations right now just around the laws of where you can use these. Again, it's private property. But the CEO, Elon Musk, he has very confidently stated that ...\n\nO'Reilly: Did this happened just yesterday on the conference call? When did he say this?\n\nShen: It may have been, but he stated that eventually, he's hoping \"summon\" could work on a coast-to-coast a basis, even, where you could summon your car in New York from Los Angeles ...\n\nO'Reilly: Oh, stop it.\n\nShen: ... across the country. Not only that, it'll know when to charge on the way, and will even sync up, potentially, with your calendar, to arrive right when you need it.\n\nO'Reilly: Wow!\n\nShen: And he's saying that's within two years. A lot of other manufacturers, automakers have put a timeline of around 2020 of when we'll really start seeing these cars hitting the road in smaller numbers. Google is even more bullish than that. But again, some of these incredible features, it just gives you an idea of what's on the horizon.\n\nO'Reilly: It definitely seems -- before we move on, really quick -- that the safety and the benefits really become prevalent when there's mass adoption. That seems to be the key.\n\nShen: Yeah, of course. And, you mentioned, with some of these prototypes, I know it's a much smaller sample, but there have been accidents, from what I recall, by human error, either by the operator, in some way, or something else.\n\nO'Reilly: I mean, they went like 2 million miles before it happened, and then it was human error. It's like, how long can you drive without an accident? (laughs) You know?\n\nShen: Yeah, that's a very impressive result. I don't think of these companies would be pursuing it if they didn't see how well this technology is coming along.\n\nO'Reilly: Cool.", "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and renewable energy driving force, is clearly frustrated with the most recent designs of the Koch brothers. He fired off a tweet today linking to a Huffington Post story that highlights the brothers' intention to once again try and kill electric cars.\n\nThe Kochs, Charles and David, sit as the heads of Koch Industries, a conglomerate built on industries like fossil fuels, chemicals and more.

Tesla's website also warns owners against playing dirty: \"Please note that we may withhold awards where we believe customers are acting in bad faith or otherwise acting contrary to the intent of this program. To be clear, commercializing or otherwise selling referral codes is not appropriate, and we will not honor such codes,\" the referral site states.\n\nTags: Car IndustryElectric CarsTesla", "Just what the world needs -- another electric supercar from a mysterious Chinese company no one has ever heard of. No, its not Faraday Future, Atieva, 2050 Motors or NextEV this time. This company is called Techrules and its ground breaking, earth shattering, never seen anything like it car is named the Turbine Recharging Electric Vehicle, or TREV. Supposedly, it will be unveiled at the Geneva international auto show in March. For now, all we have to go on is this Flight of the Valkyries style logo.\n\nTechrules is a new automotive research firm based in Beijing. Its stated goal is to \"develop disruptive powertrain technologies,\" according to Britain's CAR magazine. It's a subsidiary of TXR-S, which specializes in aerospace, high-tech materials, and biogas. The TREV may or may not be vaporware. We should know soon enough. The only information released so far says the car will have 1030 hp -- so much for those wimpy other cars that can only manage 1,000 horsepower! It's stated range is 1,242 miles.\n\nGas turbine range extender engines have been tried in battery powered cars before, most recently in the still born Jaguar C-X75 concept that went public in Geneva six years ago. The idea makes sense, but the Jaguar was oh-my-god expensive at a time when the world was still in the grip of an global economic meltdown. Actually, the world is still in the grip of a global economic meltdown, although you would never know it, based on the number of supercars and megayachts begin produced.\n\nTalk of gas turbines may seem like science fiction to some, but the company most actively promoting then today is Wrightspeed in San Francisco. It is headed by Ian Wright, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, who clashed with Elon Musk when he took over the company. Wright sold his shares in Tesla and went off to pursue his dream -- electric garbage trucks. Sure, go ahead and snicker. How could anyone be so stupid as to walk away from the one of the best investment opportunities of the 21st century?\n\nWright has no regrets. Like Musk, he sees electric vehicles as the cure for pollution belching, fossil fueled cars and trucks. But he thinks it is better to start by cleaning up heavy truck emissions first rather than building premium sedans for well heeled venture capitalists, litigators, and investment bankers.\n\nWright and his team of engineers have developed a new, highly efficient gas turbine they call Fulcrum. It operates at a steady 100,000 rpm regardless of what speed the vehicle. Wright says Fulcrum is 30% more efficient than any other turbine and has three times the power output. It runs so clean it meets all of California's rigorous emissions standards without a catalytic converter. It can run on diesel, CNG, LNG, landfill gases, biodiesel, kerosene, propane, heating oil, or any other combustible fuel.\n\nWright says each of his heavy duty electric garbage trucks can save fleet operators up to half a million dollars in lower fuel and maintenance costs compared to a diesel powered vehicle over its useful life. That's the kind of economic argument fleet operators will find hard to ignore.\n\nWill the new TREV turbines be similar to those Wrightspeed has developed? If so, they could signal a significant shift in plug-in hybrid technology while we wait for breakthroughs in batteries to reach production in a decade or so. The Wrightspeed Fulcrum weighs only 250 pounds. The Tesla 90 kWh battery weighs more than 1,200 lbs. What if an electric vehicle could have a range of over 300 miles with a battery that weighs only 600 lbs and a micro-turbine?\n\nTechrules might be important not because it makes a car that can do the castle run in less than 12 parsecs but because it paves the way for electric cars that eliminate range anxiety completely. What an interesting prospect.", "How FB Can Monetize WhatsApp to Drive Facebook Inc Stock Higher\n\nTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) stock has lost 30% of its value this year, significantly down from the all-time high set in July 2015.\n\nWhile Tesla's new car delivery guidance (PDF) was strong for 2016, investors are finally coming to the realization that Tesla stock is just too expensive. That's why Elon Musk is looking for other businesses to penetrate.\n\nThanks to SolarCity Corp (SCTY), and high demand for commercial and consumer-scale solar power, Musk may have just found that business.\n\nEven after its losses, Tesla stock is still completely out of touch with competing auto stocks. In the past, TSLA bulls could argue that comparing it to Ford (F) was unfair because Tesla is more of a technology company rather than traditional, high-volume manufacturer.\n\nThose notions have been debunked with Tesla's deceleration of growth, and also with the rise of competing, and successful, electric vehicles.\n\nSpecifically, Ford aims to have 40% of its lineup electric by 2020, thereby becoming a real threat to Tesla's existing business model. As a result, Tesla stock owners are no longer as optimistic as they once were.\n\nMost know that Tesla is building a 5.5 million square foot gigafactory to manufacture solar-powered batteries and various forms of electricity. The estimated cost? $5 billion.\n\nWhile this factory will assist Tesla in boosting production, it also creates a new opportunity for TSLA to sell batteries to consumers, businesses and also utility companies. Back in the second quarter of 2015 Tesla unveiled the Powerwall and Powerpack.\n\nThe Powerwall, which stores energy and then powers your home, will be sold to consumers for a few thousand dollars. The much larger (and more powerful) Powerpack will be used for businesses and utility companies.\n\nJust one week after the unveil in 2015, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had already received $800 million worth of orders. The Powerwall had nearly $180 million of orders and the Powerpack had already topped $625 million in orders.\n\nWhile it is unknown whether SCTY was one of the first customers to place an order, the company recently announced that Tesla's Powerpack is playing a major role with its project in Hawaii.\n\nSolarCity's power project in Hawaii for the Kaua'i Island Utility Cooperative is a chance for SCTY to show what it can do to the rest of the world. With the use of Tesla's Powerpack, SCTY plans to implement the first-ever utility scale system in the U.S. that can delivery solar power throughout the night.\n\nThis means a greater reduction of non-renewable energy sources around-the-cloud, which in turn means higher usage for Tesla's Powerpack and SolarCity's technology. Not only will KIUC pay SCTY 20% more per kilowatt hour of power generated, but SolarCity's existing solar arrays could only deliver power during the day. This new technology will deliver power at night, thereby increasing the power output at a higher rate.\n\nFor Tesla, this means more per-hour billings for the Powerpack, and thus higher revenues.\n\nIn retrospect, SolarCity's deal with KIUC may be massive by its own standards, but it is fairly small in terms of consumption. KIUC has just 33,000 customers on the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i.\n\nHowever, KIUC is part of a family of 930 electric co-ops operating in 47 states while serving more than 36 million customers. As a result, a successful project from SolarCity will potentially lead to far larger deals in the future.\n\nGiven that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the Chairman at SolarCity Corp, one has to believe that a natural partnership to gain competitive advantages is a reality between these two companies.\n\nFor Tesla, that means a larger revenue channel in supplying rechargeable energy products and a stock that is no longer tied to just vehicles. In other words, SolarCity could give Tesla stock a huge long-term boost in the right direction.", "Tesla Motors may be the first manufacturer to adopt the tablet-like infotainment system. Volvo and Renault followed suit and now Maserati jumped on the vertically mounted infotainment bandwagon with the Levante. If we're not mistaken, the Levante will make its world debut at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\nThe photograph featured above comes courtesy of Julien Jodry on Twitter, and as you can observe, it's not a 17-inch (43 cm) screen like the one equipping the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X. But then again, it's not as small as the 9-inch touchscreen of the Volvo XC90, S90 sedan and V90 wagon. The instrument cluster of the Levante is also digital, which is an even more radical move for the Italian outfit.\n\nThere's no sign of the trademark Maserati clock or wood veneer on the dashboard. Look more closely and you'll see that black plastic is the only thing surrounding the digital instrument cluster and tablet-like touchscreen infotainment system. It's a given that this is a work-in-progress pre-production mule, not a production-ready Levante. In any case, do expect the Maserati clock and acres of wood to beautify the dashboard of the long-awaited mid-size luxury crossover SUV.\n\nIn terms of exterior aesthetics, the Maserati Levante is expected to look exactly like the patent drawings leaked in May 2015. You can judge that for yourself by accessing this story. Inspired by the Ghibli sedan, the Levante is a fab addition to the luxury crossover segment because it blends aggression with style and Italian flair with a high-performance touch. Speaking of which, the Levante won't disappoint.\n\nAll variations of the Maserati Levante SUV will benefit from the Maserati Q4 AWD system and an 8-speed automatic made by ZF. Starting with V6 turbo diesels ranging from 250 to 340 PS, the upper echelon of the 2017 Maserati Levante engine range will comprise twin-turbo V6s ranging from 350 to 425 PS. However, if you want the full nelson, a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V8 with 560-plus PS should do the trick.\n\nLe nouveau SUV #Maserati #Levante \u00e9trennera un grand \u00e9cran tactile, fa\u00e7on #Tesla @AutoMotoOffi pic.twitter.com/TSWxJdbVis -- Julien JODRY (@JJODRY)\n\nFebruary 18, 2016", "No News Is Bad News For Rare Earth Minerals PLC & Sirius Minerals PLC\n\nWhen you invest in smaller company stocks you can end up jumping onto any odd scrap of news that appears from one month to the next.\n\nThis is particularly true for stocks such as Rare Earth Minerals (LSE: REM) and Sirius Minerals (LSE: SXX), neither of which are actually earning any revenues at the moment. Instead, they have a large planning and investment programme ahead of them, and investors can only cross their fingers, keep the faith and hope it all works out in the end.\n\nThe lack of major news or announcements, aside from the odd semi-conclusive drilling update, ought to leave the share price becalmed but often the opposite happens. The merest scrap of information sends investors into a whirl and blows the share price violently in all sorts of directions. Also, stocks like these risk getting damaged by commodity sector storms, even if they have little bearing on their own performance.\n\nREM's share price is down 20% year-to-date, from around 80p to 67p, despite the lack of serious news. Stocks like this can really stretch your patience. While it got a major boost last year following its deal to supply Tesla Motors with lithium hydroxide, this has led nowhere as we wait to hear whether it meets Tesla's stiff two-year performance milestones.\n\nThis year's slide downwards was reversed when European Metals Holdings, in which it has an 11.9% stake, released an optimistic update on drilling results from its Cinovec project in the Czech Republic. If you believe in the long-term case for lithium, rare earth elements and clean battery power, then you might want to take advantage of the disconcerting effect of the lack of news flow from Rare Earth Minerals. Just make sure that you have the patience to stick around while very little happens, and the courage to keep your nerve when a lot happens all at once.\n\nAIM-listed potash miner Sirius Minerals has also been sunk by the wider storms afflicting the commodities sector, as well as one or two squalls of its own. Sentiment took a knock in January after management announced a two-month delay of the definitive feasibility study on its York Potash Project, which it claims is the world's largest and highest grade deposit of polyhalite. One concern is that it will struggle to raise the \u00a32bn it needs to fund a deep mine beneath the North York Moors national park and develop export facilities at Teesside, given the troubled commodities climate.\n\nAnother worry is that fertiliser costs have fallen along with economic sentiment, hitting the potential future value of potash and further deterring investors. Yet nobody can say what will happen to the price of potash (or anything else in the notoriously cyclical agricultural sector) by the time Sirius finally starts shipping, assuming it ever does. It's merely idle talk that serves to plug the gap while investors wait for something more substantial.\n\nInvestors have rallied to the cause, forcing up the share price by 8% over the last week, although at today's 13p it's still less than half its 52-week high of 29p. Like REM, I would rather invest in SXX on no news than following a share price spike after a burst of good news. But you will still need courage and patience to see it through to the end.", "Return to video Video settings\n\nPlease Log in to update your video settings\n\nVideo will begin in 5 seconds.\n\nDon't play Play now More video Recommended\n\nPope calls Trump 'unchristian', Trump responds\n\nHelicopter crashes at Pearl Harbor\n\nGamergate victim drops case\n\nPope: 'avoiding pregnancy is not absolute evil'\n\nBaby was cut from pregnant woman\n\nReplay video Return to video Video settings\n\nPlease Log in to update your video settings\n\nElon Musk: Apple the 'graveyard' for fired Tesla staff\n\nTesla Motors CEO Elon Musk says Apple hires people the electric car maker has fired.\n\nPT1M22S 620 349\n\nThe only things hotter than Western Australia's scorched outback are the mining companies preparing to supply the lithium needed by the likes of Nissan and Tesla Motors to meet booming demand for electric cars.\n\nLithium is providing a rare bright spot for miners, amid cratering prices of raw materials tied to heavy industry such as iron ore to coal. The material, also used in tablet computers and power storage, promises gains from China's shift to consumer-driven growth and global attempts to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate - an industrial chemical used in lithium ion batteries - have surged 47 per cent in 2016 from last year's average, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Two of Australia's five best-performing stocks in the past 18 months among a Bloomberg Index of 2035 listed companies are developers of lithium materials operations. From 2015 to 2024, the market to supply lithium ion batteries for light vehicles may total $US221 billion ($310 billion), according to Navigant Consulting.\n\nTesla is a luxury vehicle now, but electric vehicles are likely to be commonplace in the future. Photo: Mark Jesser\n\n'Step Change' Advertisement\n\n\"There's a step change going on right now,\" as electric car sales rise and hybrid vehicles switch to lithium ion batteries, said Michael Fotios, executive chairman of General Mining, which is seeking to begin exports by July of the lithium-bearing mineral spodumene from Western Australia's Mt Cattlin project. \"Raw material supply hasn't kept pace, and probably can't keep pace with the projected demand.\"\n\nPerth-based General Mining, with a market value of $86 million, has seen its shares rise more than 1000 per cent since it announced a plan in February 2015 to resume production at the previously shuttered Mt Cattlin. Pilbara Minerals, with a market value of $286 million, is accelerating development of its Pilgangoora project in Western Australia and forecasts production from about 2018. The company has advanced about 1200 per cent since it acquired the site in July 2014.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have grabbed the limelight.\n\nGreenbushes, the world's largest spodumene mine, is also located in Western Australia and owned by the Talison joint venture between China's Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group and Albemarle Corp, the world's biggest lithium producer.\n\nLithium carbonate's price gains will extend to 2017 on weak supply, while demand is likely to soar 64 per cent by 2020 from 2015 levels, Citigroup forecasts. This rising demand is intensifying a race to deliver new sources of lithium raw materials, spurring gains for developers poised to enter production before the end of the decade.\n\nTesla's CEO Elon Musk has plans for a giant battery plant. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nChina is targeting the goal of five million electric vehicles on its roads by 2020, under President Xi Jinping's strategic initiative to upgrade the nation's auto industry. Nissan and Renault SA said this month that sales of battery- powered vehicles rose to a record last year, while Volkswagen's Audi plans to start building its first purely electric sport utility vehicle in 2018.\n\n\"The demand in vehicles, electric bikes, trucks and buses is going to be enormous, and the electric storage market is also going to be significant,\" said Neil Biddle, executive director of Perth-based Pilbara Minerals, which holds the world's second- biggest deposit of spodumene. Prices of spodumene have jumped to about $US480 a tonne this year from around $US380 a tonne in 2014, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nLithium products used in batteries come from three sources: hard rock mining of mineral ores including spodumene; battery recycling; and the evaporation of brine from salt ponds, the technique that has historically dominated production. While hard rock miners such as General Mining and Pilbara Minerals are higher cost than brine projects, they have lower capital spending needs and are quicker to production, making them the best placed to exploit surging prices, according to Foster Stockbroking.\n\nThe cheapest source of lithium is brine and the biggest reserves are in Chile, where companies such as Albemarle and Sociedad Quimica & Minera de Chile SA harness the sun and the world's driest desert to evaporate brine from ponds. Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, plans to develop lithium holdings in Chile's northern desert salt flats. Rio Tinto, the world's second biggest miner, has a lithium-borate project in Serbia.\n\nPrevious booms\n\nJust as in previous booms, when miners responded to increasing demand for materials by providing too much supply, a potential risk in lithium is that growth for new energy vehicles in China is being overestimated, Elsa Wang, senior analyst at consultancy Asian Metal in Beijing, said. If all current lithium projects proceed as planned, they would deliver about 330,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate-equivalent by 2020, creating \"a bit of an oversupplied market,\" according to Citigroup analyst Matthew Schembri.\n\nTesla, the producer of electric vehicles and power storage products led by billionaire Elon Musk, is preparing to open its giant Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada. It will probably require 25,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide a year when it reaches capacity, according to Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral, an industry advisory company. That's equivalent to about 45 per cent of current global supply, he said.\n\nLG Chem last year completed construction of an electric-vehicle battery plant in Nanjing, China, with capacity to supply batteries for 50,000 high-performance electric cars annually. Boston-Power is expanding its plants in China, and Panasonic, which makes batteries for Tesla cars, has added a joint venture there.\n\nNew supply from all lithium sources \"will have a critical role to play in sourcing lithium for the battery supply chain,\" Mr Moores said. \"As things stand, there will not be enough lithium to supply the battery megafactories coming onstream.\"\n\nBloomberg", "Silicon Valley's help sought to help Verbund with technology\n\nAustria's biggest utility is seeking to buy more of its electricity from the customers it serves, the latest sign of upheaval for the industry's traditional business model.\n\nVerbund AG Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Anzengruber is attempting to expand a network of \"virtual power plants\" where energy flows from homes and businesses with their own generators, usually driven by renewables. Purchases from solar, wind, biomass and hydro plants often located at the premises of existing power customers rose to 100 megawatts last year from 4 megawatts in 2014.\n\nThe move flips on its head the century-old way utilities have been doing business and moves away from the centralized power stations linked to national distribution grids, which form the primary assets of the industry. With wholesale electricity prices bumping along the lowest in 14 years, utilities from Arizona to Germany are ripping up their business plans to adapt to the generation technologies reshaping the industry.\n\n\"What the system needs is flexibility and integration with clients,\" Anzengruber said in an interview in Vienna. \"The classic electricity model of 'produce and forget' is dead.\"\n\nAbout 80 percent of Verbund's energy comes from hydropower, and Moody's Investors Service said last week Verbund's credit rating might be cut.\n\nHis remarks address concerns about Verbund's strategy as its earnings suffer from a drop in prices that already has forced change at RWE AG and EON SE, Germany's two biggest utilities. Verbund, which is 51 percent owned by the Austrian state, has lost a third of its market value in the last 12 months, and most financial analysts advise investors to sell their shares.\n\nAnzengruber said analysts are focusing on the wrong metrics, overlooking changes to the way utilities are making money that ultimately will be more important. To ensure Verbund is ready to take advantage of technologies that are forcing the shift, he dispatched a delegation of executives to Silicon Valley last year and signed a deal to sell home batteries made by Tesla Motors Inc. to Austrians.\n\n\"The analysts are always concentrated on the market structures of the past,\" said Anzengruber. \"The world is changing.\"\n\nGrowing Market\n\nFor now, Verbund's virtual power purchases are a fraction of the 70,000 megawatts of power that Austria consumes. Most of the company's electricity comes from the 127 hydro plants that dot the Alps and central European rivers. That side of the business is likely to expand, said Elchin Mammadov, an industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in London.\n\n\"I see a significant potential in the growth of virtual-power-plant capacity in central Europe,\" Mammadov said. \"Utilities can leverage their relationships with clients to cross-sell them other energy services.\"\n\nGrowth in power management service were a bright spots at Verbund through the first nine months of 2015, with earnings up 50 percent to 120 million euros ($133 million). Analysts estimate the company's full-year sales will drop for a second consecutive year to 2.7 billion euros in 2015 and are forecast for fall again this year. Verbund publishes its annual result March 9.\n\nVerbund is partnering with Austrian, German and U.S. software companies to power their new virtual offerings, said Anzengruber as he opened an iPhone application created by Tado GmbH, a Munich-based software maker that raised an additional $17 million in venture capital funding in October.\n\nPower Technology\n\nWith the application, Anzengruber, 59, can turn lights on and off at his homes in Vienna and Salzburg. Location-based software elements tell the heater to kick in the closer he gets to home. The Tado platform shows precisely how much money he's saving on his utility bill. Verbund also works with Boston's Enernoc Inc., which last year bought Entelios AG, another Munich-based maker of network management tools.\n\nThe CEO reiterated his criticism of renewable-energy subsidies given away to consumers across Europe, saying that they created unfair competition. He nevertheless acknowledged those policies are unlikely to change.\n\n\"The biggest issue in the world is decarbonization,\" Anzengruber said. \"Good ideas always get money.\"\n\n\"What good ideas don't have is access to the network,\" said the CEO, a native of Salzburg who ran a crane manufacturer before taking the Verbund job in 2010. His company is the sole owner of Austria's high-voltage power distribution network spanning 6,700 kilometers (4,164 miles).\n\nWith the help of its innovation chief, Wolfgang Pell, Verbund has set up annual technology competitions for startups. It's ready to create joint ventures, provide angel investments or outright buy new ideas in order to stay competitive, Anzengruber said.\n\n\"Electricity supply used to be a one-way street,\" said the CEO, whose company only started competing to sell electricity to consumers when markets were liberalized 15 years ago. \"Now it's about integrating supply with clients. It's a giant sleeping market.\"\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal."], "2016-02-22": ["While past General Motors executives have said some nice things about Tesla Motors, today's reality is much more naughty. The issue is whether or not Tesla should be allowed to sell its vehicles directly to customers, a battle that is alive and well in state capitols across the US. The latest example comes to us from Indiana, where a bill that was \"authored and pushed by General Motors,\" (according to Tesla) is making its way through the state legislature. Indiana currently allows Tesla to sell its EVs direct to customers in the state since 2014, but HB1254 would change that after July 1, 2016 because the bill, HB 1254, puts an expiration date on the licenses given to Tesla.\n\nThe bill says specifically that:\n\nAll dealer licenses issued to a manufacturer under this chapter expire thirty (30) months after the date on which the first dealer license is issued to the manufacturer under this chapter. A dealer license issued to a manufacturer under this chapter may not be renewed.\n\nIt's that last line that would put an end to Tesla sales in Indiana. Tesla confirmed to\n\nAutoblogGreen that it sent out a letter asking its fans to tell their legislators to not pass the bill, which will need some dramatic public persuasion, since a vote on the third reading of the bill on February 2nd passed 92-3.

On January 9, 2007, the company dropped Computer from its name and became, simply, Apple. On the same day, Apple introduced iPhone. Likewise, could Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) soon drop Motors from its name in a move to show the world just how seriously the company is taking its foray into energy storage?\n\nRendering of Tesla Powerwall. Image source: Tesla Motors.\n\nTesla Motors acquires Tesla.com\n\n\"Just wanted to thank Stu G for tesla.com,\" said Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Saturday on Twitter. \"Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.\"\n\nThe tweet followed reports around the web that Tesla.com was now redirecting traffic to TeslaMotors.com. Until now, Tesla.com was owned by Stu Grossman, an engineer and Nikola Tesla fan who has had the rights to the name since 1992, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAfter successfully acquiring Tesla.com, it wouldn't be surprising if Musk is planning a name change to Tesla. Musk even said during a question-and-answer session with press at the company's Tesla Energy event last year that, if it weren't for domain challenges, the CEO would consider changing the company's name to reflect its broader scope of operations with the introduction of its Powerwall and Powerpack energy-storage solutions under the Tesla Energy brand.\n\nA strategic shift\n\nApple's Jobs justified dropping Computer from its name in 2007 with a quote from hall-of-fame NHL hockey player Wayne Gretzky: \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.\"\n\nWhile Apple was already seeing success outside of computers with iPod when it changed its name, iPhones alone would have justified the name change. In Apple's most-recent quarter, iPhones represented a whopping 68% of the company's revenue. Similarly, a name change for Tesla could reflect the company's growing emphasis of the inclusion of energy products as a core segment.\n\nTesla's acquisition of Tesla.com notably follows a big deal for Tesla Energy to supply batteries for electric utility Kauai Island Utility Cooperative in conjunction with SolarCity's panels. The deal, which may be the biggest utility-scale storage project in North America in history, signals Tesla's confidence in its production ramp of energy products at its Gigafactory in Nevada.\n\nRendering of Tesla Powerpacks. Image source: Tesla Motors.\n\nTesla has said that the company believes energy storage will eventually represent a third of the Gigafactory's production -- no small sum considering the Gigafactory is targeting cell production by 2020 that exceeds the world's total lithium-ion cell production in 2013. And progress in Tesla Energy is already underway. In the company's most-recent shareholder letter, Tesla said the segment already has positive gross margins, and that it expects it to contribute cash to the company's business \"even with rapid growth.\"\n\nWhile a name change to Tesla wouldn't be a magic pill for helping the company broaden its operations and grow its energy business, it would signal just how seriously it is taking Tesla Energy.", "Alphabet Inc (GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Go to War ... Over Groceries?\n\nTesla Motors Inc (TSLA) stock hasn't gotten off to such a great start in 2016. In fact, it has been a pretty miserable start. Even after a more than 17% rally in the last five trading days, Tesla stock is off to the tune of 26% this year, as Wall Street flees high-risk growth stocks.\n\nBut investors have renewed hope, as evidenced by today's rally, which saw TSLA shares jump as much as 7%. Some of that optimism, however, may be misguided.\n\nOver the weekend, Business Insider, in a clicktacular story entitled \"There's another new Tesla on the way, but nobody's talking about it yet,\" reminded the world that, well, there's a new Tesla coming, and nobody's really talking about it.\n\nCompelling, right? More than 38,000 people thought so, as evidenced by BI's pageview counter and a little flame symbol, signifying the story is \"hot.\"\n\nThere are a few problems, however, with incorporating the information in that article into your bullish thesis on TSLA stock.\n\nThe article reminds the reader of the revamped Tesla Roadster -- Tesla's first-ever model -- that's due out in 2019. It will be a speed demon, equipped with a special feature called \"Maximum Plaid\" that CEO Elon Musk says will be faster than \"Ludicrous Mode\" on the Model S P90D. For the record, the Model S P90D starts at $108,000 and does 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds.\n\nSome optimistic Tesla stock owners read this article and thought: \"Wow. Tesla's getting sexier by the minute.\" Hopefully, they didn't rush out and buy shares, because this intel is irrelevant to TSLA stock now, in 2016.\n\nBut why?\n\nFirst off: It's old news! This is recycled information that first emerged last summer at a TSLA press conference announcing the Ludicrous Mode for the P85D and Model X.\n\nSecond, while Musk may have said at that press conference that the next generation Roadster would be coming in four years, we have more than enough reason to be skeptical. Tesla has become notorious for production delays, and the slothlike Model X production is a central reason TSLA stock has been an underperformer in the last year.\n\nPlus, even if the sexy new Roadster does come in 2019, it'll be a mere footnote in the story that drives TSLA stock. By then, the traction of the Model 3 (expected in late 2017) will already be visible, and the success or failure of the $35,000 mass-produced EV is ultimately where TSLA investors succeed or fail as well.\n\nThe Business Insider article incoherently muses that the Model X and Model 3,\n\n\"...are all anyone has been talking about lately -- especially Wall Street analysts who want to figure out which way Tesla's extremely volatile stock price is headed.\"\n\nWhat scoundrels! Who in their right mind would keep up with Tesla's most recent release (Model X) and Tesla's first-ever mass-produced vehicle (Model 3) when trying to figure out where TSLA stock should trade?\n\nThe next sentence is meant to shock you and hook you simultaneously:\n\n\"But Tesla is working on another car that nobody ever mentions,\" it says.\n\nDo not be shocked. Do not get hooked. Nobody ever mentions it because ... wait for it ... IT'S NOT RELEVANT. Does anyone talk about what the iPhone 9S means for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock? No. Thank god, no.\n\nDon't buy TSLA on this \"news.\" Keep paying attention to those two pesky issues Wall Streeters can't ignore: The Model X and any new developments regarding the Model 3.", "If reports are accurate, this Volkswagen factory in Tennessee could start cranking out electric cars as part of a settlement between VW and the U.S. government. Image source: Volkswagen.\n\nWill the Feds force Volkswagen (NASDAQOTH:VLKAY) to make electric cars in the United States as part of its punishment for cheating on emissions testing?\n\nAccording to reports in a major German newspaper, that's one possibility that has been floated in VW's talks with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is apparently taking a very tough line with VW -- in part, according to these reports, because they have reason to believe VW's top managers knew about the cheating long before they admitted it to regulators.\n\nVW execs weren't forthcoming, and the Feds hate that\n\nIf there ever was a chance the EPA would let VW off with a recall and a moderate fine, that moment seems to have passed. Generally speaking, U.S. federal regulators (and prosecutors) will be more inclined to be lenient with a company if they think senior managers were willing to admit a problem in a timely way.\n\nIt's starting to look like that's not what happened with Volkswagen.\n\nEarly last week, Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported that internal memos and emails from VW indicated that senior executives knew VW couldn't bring its cheating vehicles into compliance with air-pollution regulations in early 2014, long before they admitted it, and while they were leading EPA and California regulators to believe otherwise.\n\nThe report, which was confirmed by The New York Times after it had a chance to review the VW documents, may have put VW in a very hot spot, and not just with environmental regulators. (Among other things, it's now open to charges that it failed to make appropriate disclosures to investors.)\n\nThat in turn gives the EPA a lot of leverage in settlement talks. And according to a report over the weekend in another German paper, Welt am Sonntag, it's using that leverage in interesting ways.\n\nThe Feds want VW to make a big commitment to \"electric mobility\" here\n\nThe Welt report says the EPA wants Volkswagen to make a large commitment to \"electric mobility in the United States.\" According to that report, the commitment would have two major parts.\n\nFirst, VW would have to commit to building electric cars at its sole U.S. factory, in Chattanooga. VW has a new electric-vehicle architecture under development; it's expected to eventually underpin a whole range of battery-electric cars, from affordable small VWs to higher-end Audis and Porsches; the Feds want at least some of them to be built here in the United States.\n\nSecond, according to the report, the EPA is apparently pushing VW to help create a network of electric-vehicle recharging stations in the U.S. to help encourage the wider adoption of battery-electric vehicles by mainstream U.S. consumers. Right now, the closest thing to a national recharging network in the U.S. is Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ:TSLA) growing list of Supercharger stations. But Tesla uses a proprietary recharging system, and while CEO Elon Musk has offered to license it to other automakers, to date, none have taken him up on the offer. Presumably, the EPA is hoping that VW will help create a network of stations that use a universal standard.\n\nTaken together, the two commitments could well cost VW a billion dollars or more. But it looks likely the company is going to have to write a hefty check to the U.S. government no matter what else happens. It's possible the EPA is arguing that it will be cheaper for VW in the long run to take this alternative course, and it's possible that will turn out to be true.\n\nWe already knew this was going to cost VW a fortune\n\nVW isn't going to get off cheap, no matter what happens. The Welt report also indicates that VW will probably be forced to repurchase about 100,000 of the roughly 600,000 diesel-powered VW Group products in the U.S. that the EPA says include emissions \"defeat devices\" coded into their software.\n\nAssuming an average value of $15,000 for those cars, that's $1.5 billion right there -- before the costs of the other recalls, and before any fines or penalties.\n\nAnd that's just in the United States. VW also has to contend with irate regulators and prosecutors in Europe and elsewhere: Most recently, Reuters reported that South Korean prosecutors raided VW's local offices for emissions-related documents last week.\n\nLast fall, not long after the scandal broke, VW took a one-time charge of 6.5 billion euros (at the time, $7.4 billion) to cover the costs of the scandal. It seemed likely at the time that it wouldn't be enough. We still don't know how much all of this will cost. But it now seems certain that there are more big one-time charges yet to come.", "(Bloomberg) -- Carmakers are becoming a familiar sight at tech shows, where theyre rolling out new models to woo a generation of consumers who question the need for a car that only gets them from A to B.\n\nAt this weeks Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Ford Motor Co. unveiled a new vehicle for Europe as well as in-cockpit technology, Volvo is showing off a keyless car and Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton will appear on a panel with the president of chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nEager to win over millennials who may care more about the latest Apple Inc. iPhone than a redesigned Mustang, automakers are trying to become more tech-savvy and shed their image as 20th century metal benders. The pivot toward the younger set comes amid a slowdown in China, competition from Tesla Motors Inc. -- which sends automatic software updates to the cars command center -- and a boom in ride-sharing services such as Uber that have left car companies anxious about growth and eager to try out a new crop of digital products and services.\n\nCarmakers have a very narrow window of opportunity to win over Generation Y,said Richard Viereckl, an analyst at PwC in Frankfurt who co-authored a 2015 study on connected cars. Theyre at these technology shows to portray their brands as hip, and with mounting competition from the likes of Apple, Panasonic and Sony, theyre fighting to keep the attention of and access to their customers.\n\nBy 2022, 345 million autos worldwide will be connected to the Internet, nearly four times more than last year, according to IHS Automotive. In six years, 98 percent of the cars sold globally will be connected, up from 30 percent last year, the consulting firm said. The trend is driven by customer demand: Three in four consumers said they consider connected car services an important feature in their next vehicle purchase, AT&T Inc. and Ericsson said in a report in October.\n\nThe risk for carmakers is that Apple, Google and Microsoft Corp. will conquer the connected-car business with operating systems and apps that people are familiar with. Google and Apple already offer in-car infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and Google is at the forefront of developing self-driving cars.\n\nGoogle and Apple have a good chance as anyone at grabbing the car ecosystem, said Kevin Curran, a computer science professor at Ulster University in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. \"Cars today are computers with wheels, and tech companies know that field all too well.\n\nTo fend off the threat, carmakers are set to make big decisions over the next 24 months, striking cooperation pacts and increasing spending on research and development as well as M&A to get ahead, said Thilo Koslowski, who heads the auto practice at researcher Gartner Inc. Those who dont are at risk of being left behind, he said.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. debuted its Chevrolet Bolt electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, before taking it to the Detroit auto show a week later. Such moves are aimed at highlighting vehicles software and Web features, with carmakers adding iPad-like dashboard touch screens and moving beyond to even more futuristic systems.\n\nGerman automakers BMW AG, Audi AG and Daimler AG last year teamed up to buy Nokia Oyjs HERE map business, a response to Google and Apple. BMWs iDrive system brings apps, radio and navigation to the dashboard, reducing knobs and buttons for a user experience thats closer to that of a smartphone. Porsches Mission E concept car unveiled last year features eye-tracking and gesture-control functions, which include holograms that allow the driver to grab apps out of the air.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress, Ford introduced a new model of the Kuga sport utility vehicle for the European market with updated communications, entertainment and driver-assistance features. It also outlined its latest plans under the umbrella of Ford Smart Mobility, the companys initiative encompassing areas such as connectivity, autonomous vehicles and big data.\n\nWe are transitioning from an auto company to an auto and mobility company, Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fieldssaid in a Bloomberg TV interview at the event on Monday. The company is tripling its engineering investment in technologies making cars more semi-autonomous, Fields said.\n\nIts a tall order for automakers contending with fleet-footed tech companies. The disruption brought by the connected car is similar to what happened 100 years ago, when the automobile successfully challenged the horse and carriage industry, Koslowski said. Engineering excellence isnt enough anymore, but to appeal to the next generation of buyers a carmaker needs to show how it can enrich a consumers digital lifestyle, he said.\n\n\"Automakers have an opportunity to make cars even more compelling and spark a renaissance of the car,\" Koslowskisaid. \"They are being challenged and they have to be careful that they dont turn into a horse and carriage industry.\n\n--With assistance from Richard Weiss and David Welch To contact the reporters on this story: Stefan Nicola in Berlin at snicola2@bloomberg.net, Keith Naughton in Southfield, Michigan at knaughton3@bloomberg.net.

The other is James Mahoney, a \"confidante of the [Koch] brothers and member of their company's board.\"\n\nThe pair held preliminary talks with \"several energy giants\" last year, the article says. Then, Mahoney moderated a seminar on \"Changing the Energy Narrative\" at the secretive California retreat held by the brothers for wealthy conservative donors and activists.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the writer notes, \"Neither Mahoney nor Drevna returned multiple calls seeking comment about the new group. A Koch spokesman also didn't respond to a request for comment.\"\n\nThe article is longer than the usual Huffington Post piece, and quotes analysts and commentators on both sides of the issue.\n\nIts general drift is that electric-car adoption may grow exponentially in years and decades to come, and the group will mount a \"pugnacious\" defense of the role of fossil fuels for transportation against an Administration perceived to have a bias toward phasing them out.\n\nLobbying sources suggest that a likely approach for such a campaign could be as simple as, \"Petroleum creates American jobs.\"\n\nTesla CEO Musk provided a single-word comment on the article in a Friday tweet.\n\nSigh ...https://t.co/VelOzAKIW6 -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nHe followed up an hour later with another comment:\n\nWorth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health costs https://t.co/4li5E013Dj -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nFor context, over the past five years, Nissan has sold 200,000 Leaf electric cars, Tesla and General Motors have each sold roughly 100,000 cars with plugs, and more than a dozen other carmakers now offer plug-in hybrids, battery-electric cars, or both.\n\nThe U.S. EPA has estimated that updating a 2012 vehicle to meet corporate average fuel economy regulations in effect for 2025 will add about $3,000 in real dollars to the cost of every car, or about 10 percent of today's average transaction price.\n\nLithium-ion battery cells historically decline in cost about 7 percent a year--and for cars, perhaps more steeply over the past five years--and Tesla has shown how a DC fast-charging network can allow fully electric cars to travel long distances.\n\nWith a new crop of 200-mile electric cars coming for 2017 and beyond, industry analysts expect a new group of buyers to be willing to consider plug-in cars.\n\nWhether and when adoption of plug-in cars accelerates is a topic for endless, lengthy, and often contentious debate in government, carmaker boardrooms, and the ranks of enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nBut if legacy energy interests are in fact planning a campaign to tout the transportation benefits of burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide into the world's air, perhaps their prospects are brighter than some had realized.\n\nMeanwhile, as Washington Post writer Brian Fung notes, \"When billionaires go to war, the rest of us grab the popcorn.\"", "New listings and closed sales are on the rise in Western Pennsylvania, according to the January residential real estate report from West Penn Multi-List Inc.

The bill would let people come to the $3 million showroom and buy cars, but it would force Tesla to ship each order to Utah rather than keeping an in-state car inventory, said Jim Chen, the company's vice president for regulatory affairs.

Last year's solar surge outpaced additions of natural gas capacity for the first time, the groups said.\n\nFive states -- California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Nevada and New York -- led most of the nation's growth in solar projects, although the market is starting to diversify. Twenty-four of the 35 states surveyed saw solar market growth in 2015, said Shayle Kann, senior vice president of GTM Research in Boston.\n\n\"The U.S. solar market remains concentrated in key states, with the top ten states accounting for 87 percent of installed capacity in 2015,\" he said in a statement. \"But growth has been widespread.\"\n\nU.S. solar installations last year beat out natural gas capacity additions, with solar supplying 29.5 percent of all new U.S. electric generating capacity. Photo: GTM Research / SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight Report\n\nU.S. solar projects supplied 29.5 percent of the nation's new electric generating capacity last year, according to the research outfit.\n\nResidential rooftop projects saw the greatest growth, jumping 66 percent year-over-year with more than 2,000 megawatts in installations. Giant utility-scale projects grew 6 percent year-over-year but still represented more than half of all solar PV installed last year. The non-residential market, including commercial rooftop projects, added more than 1,000 megawatts in projects, but remained roughly flat compared to 2014.\n\nSolar developers raced to build new projects last year under the federal Investment Tax Credit, which was expected to ramp down next year. The incentive allows solar companies to claim tax credits at 30 percent the price of a solar array, but the credits were initially scheduled to fall to 10 percent in 2017 - driving a building boom. Congress in December extended the credit, which will stay at 30 percent through 2019, then steadily decline to 10 percent in 2022, where it will remain.\n\nPlunging solar prices are also driving installations as household rooftop projects and large-scale utility projects become more affordable. Installed project costs are down more than 50 percent since 2009 thanks to cheaper panel prices, more efficient construction and falling financing costs. The median cost of installing solar panels fell from $6.3 per watt in 2009 to $3.1 per watt for projects completed in 2014, and prices keep dropping, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory reported in September.\n\nElectricity generated from utility-scale renewable plants is expected to grow by 9 percent in 2016, including a 28-percent jump in large-scale solar projects.

(NASDAQ:SCTY) plunged by over 30 percent earlier this month after the company -- whose largest investor is Tesla Motors Inc. founder Elon Musk -- forecast a bigger-than-expected loss for the first quarter and said installations fell short of its target. Its competitors Vivint Solar Inc., SunRun Inc. and SunEdison Inc. have also seen their shares lose value, although solar companies Monday were gaining in New York markets.\n\n\"Without a doubt, 2015 was a monumental year for the U.S. solar industry,\" Rhone Resch, president and CEO of Solar Energy Industries Association, the main trade group, said in a statement Monday. \"Over the next few years, we're going to see solar continue to reach unprecedented heights as our nation makes a shift toward a carbon-free source of energy.\"", "The U.S. auto safety regulator said it's investigating all Takata Corp. air-bag inflators that use a chemical propellant banned from future models and will compile data to determine whether to expand the industry's broadest recall ever.\n\nThe consent order Takata and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration agreed to in November enables the regulator to direct more recalls based on new testing and field data, said Gordon Trowbridge, an NHTSA spokesman. Reuters reported Monday that U.S. authorities were calculating whether 70 million to 90 million more air-bag inflators should be recalled, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nNHTSA said in the November order that it no longer had confidence in the safety of ammonium nitrate propellant, which remains under scrutiny as Takata inflators have ruptured and sprayed shards of metal and plastic at motorists. The most recent expansion of recalls, announced last month, brought the total number of inflators requiring replacement to more than 28 million, according to NHTSA's website.\n\n\"As we've said many times before, the agency believes the number of additional inflators that could be recalled under the consent order we issued Takata in November is in the tens of millions,\" Trowbridge said in an email.\n\nTakata is cooperating fully with regulators and its customers, and continues to test inflators, build replacement air-bag kits and raise consumer awareness of recalled vehicles, spokesman Hideyuki Matsumoto said. He declined to say how many inflators with ammonium nitrate Takata has produced.\n\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called for vigilance even among automakers that had yet to recall vehicles using Takata air bags and said in an interview with Bloomberg News in November that repair programs may widen.\n\nIn January, NHTSA directed Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz to recall vehicles for the first time. Tesla Motors and Tata Motors's Jaguar Land Rover also are among Takata's customers using air bag inflators with ammonium nitrate propellants.\n\nTakata produced about 87.3 million inflators with two kinds of ammonium nitrate propellant and supplied them to auto manufacturers in North America as of the end of June 2015, the company told NHTSA in response to an order issued that month. Production of those inflators was ongoing for at least a dozen automakers at that time, including Toyota, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen and Tesla, according to Takata's response to the NHTSA order.\n\nReuters reported that as many as 120 million Takata inflators in U.S. vehicles contain ammonium nitrate propellant, citing company documents verified by two former Takata managers.\n\nHonda Motor Co., Takata's biggest customer and a minority shareholder, is not aware of whether 90 million more air bags need to be replaced, spokeswoman Yuka Abe said. The automaker's priority is to find out the root cause of the air-bag inflator ruptures and replace them as soon as possible, she said.\n\nThe Associated Press last week cited unidentified experts as saying there could be as many as 50 million Takata air-bag inflators in cars that have yet to be called back for repairs.", "Apple Stores might eventually sell you a car directly. Image source: Apple.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nApple is seriously considering making an electric car. This we know. What we don't know is whether or not the Mac maker will actually pull the trigger or not. But there's actually something else we know: We know how Apple would sell its Apple Car if it decides to move forward.\n\nMuch like Tesla Motors , Apple will pursue a direct sales model for all the same reasons it opened up its own network of retail stores 15 years ago.\n\nApple will be in Tesla's corner\n\nTesla's battle with incumbent automakers over the traditional dealership model has waged for years, with no signs of letting up anytime soon. In fact, General Motors just authored a bill in Indiana (HB1254) that would push Tesla out of the state based on protectionist dealer laws. Despite the fact that the average consumer is overwhelmingly in favor of direct sales, local lobbying is a powerful force and a meaningful campaign contributor.\n\nHowever, if Apple were to jump in, it would absolutely push for direct sales. And Apple has a significantly larger customer base than Tesla. The electric automaker does its best to rally support to pressure policymakers, but Apple could potentially tip the scales in Silicon Valley's favor. This fight is really about bolstering public perception, because that will force the hand of lawmakers.\n\nEducation, not sales\n\nTesla's retail sales reps are not primarily trained or compensated on sales. In states where Tesla is allowed to sell through showrooms, reps do earn a small commission for sales, but it's a very small fraction of their overall compensation. This gives them some incentive, but also removes the high-pressure sales tactics that characterize the industry.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTesla focuses on education at its retail locations, just like Apple. Image source: Tesla.\n\nInstead, Tesla retail reps focus on education. Selling electric cars requires a significant amount of education. How long do I need to charge? What does electricity cost compared to gas? Can I take long-distance road trips when I want to? What's the difference between all the types of chargers out there? This is why the traditional dealership model simply would not work for Tesla. Not only do electric vehicles require less service than gas cars, thereby undermining one of the dealers' primary profit centers, but it also just takes a lot more time to close a sale.\n\nYou'll note that this is precisely the model that Apple uses, too. Apple Store reps are also primarily trained to educate consumers about the product. The key to this strategy is that the product sells itself. Significantly, this reinforces the view that the absolute most important thing for a company to focus on is creating a compelling product. If you get that right, the rest takes care of itself.\n\nInventory is evil\n\nDemand is so strong for Teslas that it doesn't even need to build inventory. Tesla can't even keep up with demand. This is how it is able to drive sales through Apple-esque showrooms at locations with high foot-traffic. Can you imagine General Motors selling cars in a mall?\n\nIt's not realistic for most automakers since they need to have inventory lots that take up a lot of real estate. But Tesla educates consumers about the car, and then they go order one online. It takes Tesla longer to produce and deliver the car, but it's worth the wait.\n\nYou can easily imagine Apple adopting an identical model. Apple allows customers to customize build-to-order Macs, and they're shipped directly from China to their doorstep. Apple wouldn't need a large inventory of cars on hand, and indeed Tim Cook believes that inventory is evil. Apple does have envious inventory turnover figures to maintain, after all.\n\nIt would be easy for Apple to implement a build-to-order model for electric cars, and it would have no problem with generating demand. Unlike Tesla, Apple's marketing machine is a beast (mostly because Tesla does no advertising).\n\nTo the death\n\nOf course, dealers will continue to fight to the death (literally). The direct sales model is very much an existential threat. They'll cite things like \"intra-brand competition\" as proof that their existence is justified, even though the argument is fundamentally flawed.\n\nRemoving the middleman will reduce costs for consumers. Dealers compete to reduce their markup, but I think consumers would agree that they would prefer no markup whatsoever. This would also remove the whole haggling process, which is easily one of the most dreaded aspects of buying a car. Tesla doesn't negotiate because it doesn't have to.\n\nBesides, can you imagine Apple negotiating on price?\n\nThe article How Apple, Inc.

That's significant because the federal loan guarantee program that launched the US utility-scale solar market from virtually nothing actually stopped way back in 2011, as required by a 2009 law.\n\nThe continued growth of the US solar industry after the federal loan program stopped is also significant because Republican leaders and pundits used the program to bash the Obama Administration, the Energy Department, and the solar industry all throughout the 2012 presidential election cycle, after the company Solyndra went belly up in 2011.\n\nActually, it is former President George W. Bush who should be thanked (or bashed, as the case may be). The federal loans were issued under the Energy Department's Loan Program Office, which was established through an Act of Congress that then-President Bush signed into law as the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The idea was to get US innovations out of development and into the marketplace, so the country could compete globally. The world solar market was just beginning to take off back then, and the US was far behind.\n\nWhile President Obama took the heat for Solyndra's failure, the fact is that the company began its loan application under President Bush. More to the point, the loan program as a whole was designed to absorb a certain measure of risk, and its successful recipients have created tens of thousands of new jobs.\n\nThe roster of success famously includes Tesla Motors, which grew so quickly that it paid off its federal loan way ahead of schedule. Somewhat ironically, Tesla is now leasing a former Solyndra facility in California. The solar giant SolarCity is also leasing another Solyndra building at that location.\n\nFor the record, Tesla and SolarCity are related through cleantech superhero Elon Musk. SolarCity also applied for a federal loan guarantee but the application fell through as the manufactured Solyndra \"scandal\" began hitting high gear.\n\nAlthough the SolarCity federal loan didn't materialize, the Loan Programs Office can still be partly credited with getting the company off the ground. During the application process, SolarCity hooked up with Merrill Lynch, which was one of 14 financial institutions that the Energy Department partnered with for the Desert Sunlight project.\n\nLast time we checked, SolarCity counted 13,000 employees on its rolls.\n\nThat brings us to the new Energy Department solar update. The folks over at the Loan Programs Office are happy to point out those same 14 institutions are behind many of the utility-scale solar projects that have launched with private financing after 2011.\n\nAs illustrated by the chart at the top of this article, utility-scale solar (100 megawatts and up) grew from zero to five projects with federal loans, then ballooned up to an additional 17 with private financing as of February 15. This week's update puts the number of non-federal, utility-scale solar projects at 28, ranging across six states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, and Utah.\n\nThe Energy Department also points out that the success of the Loan Programs Office for utility-scale solar has rippled throughout the solar marketplace, driving the cost of solar on its steep downward trajectory:\n\nFederal dollars still play a huge part in driving that trend, even though the Loan Programs Office stopped providing new solar loans after 2011. That's because another Energy Department program popped up to fill the gap.\n\nWe're talking about the SunShot Initiative, which aims at bringing the cost of solar down to parity with fossil fuels. The initiative takes a soup-to-nuts approach for a whole raft of improvements over and above developing more efficient solar cell technology.\n\nThat includes pushing down the cost of solar cell manufacturing, and coincidentally (or not), an Energy Department proteg\u00e9 called Banyan Energy made news last week for introducing an \"ultra-low-cost\" solar manufacturing system.\n\nBanyan got a lift from the Energy Department's SunShot Incubator program for startups with $500,000 in funding:\n\nBanyan Energy has taken a fundamentally new approach to concentrating sunlight. The company's innovation is based on an optics breakthrough called aggregated total internal reflection (ATIR), in which light is concentrated, aggregated, and delivered to a focal area via a waveguide. With the DOE funding, the company has developed a flat 7x optic approach for concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), which promises to lower the cost of silicon PV modules and increase the scale of production. With this new technology, silicon module manufacturers can lower their capital-expenditure-per-watt manufacturing costs, increase the scale of module production by as much as five times, and encourage the adoption of silicon modules by tying in to the existing silicon infrastructure (meaning that cells, trackers, installation practices, and grid technologies can stay the same)...\n\nIt looks like Banyan has followed through on its R&D. According to last week's news report, the company is licensing its \"Optiwave\" technology to silicon solar cell manufacturers, enabling them to dive under the 30 cents per watt mark.\n\nPart of the savings comes from the \"optically enhanced\" structure of the cell, which requires 80% less silicon. The new system also eliminates an expensive laminating step.", "New York (AFP) - Wall Street stocks rose early Monday as oil prices gained, joining a global equity rally ahead of key US economic data releases later in the week.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 16,587.34, up 195.35 points (1.19 percent).\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 climbed 24.41 (1.27 percent) to 1,942.19, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 60.44 (1.34 percent) to 4,551.37.\n\nUS oil prices rose more than five percent after the International Energy Agency said US shale production could fall by 600,000 barrels a day in 2016, lessening a global glut.\n\nKey data releases this week include the Conference Board's reading of consumer confidence for February and a second estimate of US economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nPetroleum-linked shares moved decisively higher, with Dow member Chevron rising 2.1 percent, Apache 3.8 percent and Halliburton 4.2 percent.\n\nLarge miners also rose, including aluminum producer Alcoa, which jumped 9.0 percent, and company Freeport-McMoRan, which gained 13.2 percent.\n\nAmazon advanced 2.6 percent and Tesla Motors 5.2 percent.\n\nPharmaceutical company Allergan rose 3.4 percent after reporting that fourth-quarter adjusted net income translated into $3.41 per share, seven cents above analyst expectations.\n\nVF Corp., which owns the Nautica and Wrangler clothing brands, rose 3.4 percent after reporting that fourth-quarter net income rose 156 percent to $312.2 million.

(IBM) and Apple, Inc. (AAPL) are two completely different companies. IBM is an IT company with a diverse range of software and services aimed at enterprise customers. And while Apple also serves enterprise customers, it is mostly consumer-focused, with hardware and also software.\n\nStill, many investors might be trying to decide between the two as an investment, given that both stocks are well off their respective highs and are big buyback and dividend opportunities.\n\nSo, if you had to choose just one, which would it be? Apple stock or IBM stock?\n\nAAPL and IBM both trade a bit over 9x next year's expected earnings. Looking ahead to the coming year, both companies are expected to see a mid-single-digit decline in revenue compared to last year.\n\nThis decline in revenue coupled with the similar P/E multiples is why some investors might choose one or the other, but not both stocks.\n\nWith that said, the idea that IBM and AAPL are on the same level operationally is just an illusion, and the fact that IBM stock trades at the same multiple simply illustrates the great degree of value that's present in Apple stock.\n\nFor one, the growth outlook for this year is very misleading because IBM is being compared to a previous year where revenue declined 12%. If IBM meets analyst expectations for this year, then its full year revenue would have fallen more than 16% from 2014. Altogether, IBM's expected $78 billion in revenue this year represents a total decline of $25 billion over the last four years.\n\nWhile IBM has had about a quarter of its annual revenue wiped out in just four years' time, Apple's business has grown 33%, or more than $14 billion annually. Furthermore, Apple may have its first year of revenue loss during the iPhone era in 2016, but that's only because of how good of a year it had in 2015.\n\nApple's full-year expectation for $227.4 billion in revenue for 2016 represents a 24.4% increase from its sales in 2014. So on a compound annualized basis, AAPL is still growing at a very impressive rate.\n\nNot to mention, Apple's impressive performance is expected to continue beyond 2016, with analysts already predicting growth of 6% next year. Meanwhile, IBM is expected to produce its first year of flat growth in 2017. That would follow five years of consistent and significant losses.\n\nWhen you consider the above, Apple stock looks like the value investment of the century while trading at the same multiple as IBM stock.\n\nGranted, IBM's dividend of 4% is about double that of AAPL. Still, Apple stock is deserving of a far higher multiple than IBM, much like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) at its multiple to next year's earnings of 17.\n\nAs a result, one must conclude that long-term, AAPL stock value will return much larger gains than the 2% dividend advantage that investors can obtain by owning IBM stock.\n\nIn retrospect, AAPL is still a growth company, despite 2016's bump in the road, and the fact that its stock has fallen 27% from its high, and now trades at a similar premium as IBM stock is a blessing in disguise.", "When it comes to direct sales, Apple could be a powerful ally for Tesla.\n\nApple Stores might eventually sell you a car directly.

Lithium is providing a rare bright spot for miners, amid cratering prices of raw materials tied to heavy industry such as iron ore to coal. Bloomberg\n\nThe only things hotter than Western Australia's scorched Outback are the mining companies preparing to supply the lithiumneeded by the likes of Nissan and Tesla to meet booming demand for electric cars.\n\nLithium is providing a rare bright spot for miners, amid cratering prices of raw materials tied to heavy industry such as iron ore to coal. The material, also used in tablet computers and power storage, promises gains from China's shift to consumer-driven growth and global attempts to curb reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nPrices of lithium carbonate -- an industrial chemical used in lithium ion batteries -- have surged 47 percent in 2016 from last year's average, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Two of Australia's five best-performing stocks in the past 18 months among a Bloomberg Index of 2,035 listed companies are developers of lithium materials operations.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2024, the market to supply lithium ion batteries for light vehicles may total $221 billion, according to Navigant Consulting Inc.\n\n\"There's a step change going on right now,\" as electric car sales rise and hybrid vehicles switch to lithium ion batteries, said Michael Fotios, executive chairman of General Mining Corp., which is seeking to begin exports by July of the lithium-bearing mineral spodumene from Western Australia's Mt. Cattlin project. \"Raw material supply hasn't kept pace, and probably can't keep pace with the projected demand.\"\n\nPerth-based General Mining, with a market value of A$89 million ($63 million), has seen its shares rise more than 1,000 percent in Sydney trading since it announced a plan in February 2015 to resume production at the previously shuttered Mt. Cattlin. Pilbara Minerals, with a market value of A$286 million, is accelerating development of its Pilgangoora project in Western Australia and forecasts production from about 2018. The company has advanced about 1,200 percent since it acquired the site in July 2014.\n\nGreenbushes, the world's largest spodumene mine, is also located in Western Australia and owned by the Talison joint venture between China's Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group Co. and Albemarle Corp., the world's biggest lithium producer.\n\nLithium carbonate's price gains will extend to 2017 on weak supply, while demand is likely to soar 64 percent by 2020 from 2015 levels, Citigroup forecasts. This rising demand is intensifying a race to deliver new sources of lithium raw materials, spurring gains for developers poised to enter production before the end of the decade.\n\nChina is targeting the goal of five million electric vehicles on its roads by 2020, under President Xi Jinping's strategic initiative to upgrade the nation's auto industry. Nissan and Renault SA said this month that sales of battery-powered vehicles rose to a record last year, while Volkswagen AG'sAudi plans to start building its first purely electric sport utility vehicle in 2018.\n\n\"The demand in vehicles, electric bikes, trucks and buses is going to be enormous, and the electric storage market is also going to be significant,\" said Neil Biddle, executive director of Perth-based Pilbara Minerals, which holds the world's second-biggest deposit of spodumene. Prices of spodumene have jumped to about $480 a metric ton this year from around $380 a ton in 2014, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nLithium products used in batteries come from three sources: hard rock mining of mineral ores including spodumene; battery recycling; and the evaporation of brine from salt ponds, the technique that has historically dominated production. While hard rock miners such as General Mining and Pilbara Minerals are higher cost than brine projects, they have lower capital spending needs and are quicker to production, making them the best placed to exploit surging prices, according to Foster Stockbroking.\n\nThe cheapest source of lithium is brine and the biggest reserves are in Chile, where companies such as Albemarle and Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile harness the sun and the world's driest desert to evaporate brine from ponds.\n\nCodelco, the world's largest copper producer, plans to develop lithium holdings in Chile's northern desert salt flats. Rio Tinto Group, the world's second-biggest miner, has a lithium-borate project in Serbia.\n\nJust as in previous booms, when miners responded to increasing demand for materials by providing too much supply, a potential risk in lithium is that potential growth for new energy vehicles in China is being overestimated, Elsa Wang, senior analyst at consultancy Asian Metal Inc. in Beijing, said by phone. If all current lithium projects proceed as planned, they would deliver about 330,000 tons of lithium carbonate-equivalent by 2020, creating \"a bit of an oversupplied market,\" according to Citigroup analyst Matthew Schembri.\n\nTesla, the producer of electric vehicles and power storage products led by billionaire Elon Musk, is preparing to open its giant Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada. It will probably require 25,000 tons of lithium hydroxide a year when it reaches capacity, according to Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral, an industry advisory company. That's equivalent to about 45 percent of current global supply, he said.\n\nLG Chem Ltd. last year completed construction of an electric-vehicle battery plant in Nanjing, China, with capacity to supply batteries for 50,000 high-performance electric cars annually. Boston-Power Inc. is expanding its plants in China, and Panasonic Corp., which makes batteries for Tesla cars, has added a joint venture there.\n\nNew supply from all lithium sources \"will have a critical role to play in sourcing lithium for the battery supply chain,\" Moores said. \"As things stands, there will not be enough lithium to supply the battery megafactories coming onstream.\"", "According to a report by Bloomberg, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s CEO Elon Musk was asked during the unveiling of Tesla Energy if he ever plans on changing his company's name from \"Tesla Motors\" to simply \"Tesla.\"\n\nMusk responded that he may not be able to change the company's name to \"Tesla\" -- which would accurately reflect the range of products it sells outside of cars -- due to domain issues.\n\nThe report added that Stu Grossman, a computer network engineer and admirer of Nikola Tesla, has been the owner of the Tesla.com domain since 1992. That is, until now.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson confirmed with Bloomberg that the company is now the rightful and legal owner of Tesla.com. However, the company declined to comment if Tesla paid for the domain, and if so how much. What is known is that a hurdle that once prevented Musk from changing his company's name has since been removed.\n\nShares of Tesla were trading higher by more than 2 percent early Monday morning.", "Washington, D.C. - (RealEstateRama) -- Renewable energy allows American families and businesses to generate their own clean energy, and advances in energy storage will allow our nation to better harness this energy. However, one critical tax law may slow that process down.\n\nThat is why U.S. Rep. Mike Honda (D-Silicon Valley, Calif.) was joined by a dozen of his colleagues, in a letter calling on Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to allow those storage innovations the same tax credit that is available for clean energy generation.\n\n\"We believe that including storage devices ... is an important step in securing our nation's energy future,\" the letter reads in part. \"Providing guidance that is inclusive of energy storage will allow for the nationwide adoption of these technologies in new and broader applications while enabling consumers to take full advantage of the benefits provided by the ITC.\"\n\nThe IRS is working on new guidance to accompany Section 48 of the tax code, which provides a 30 percent tax credit for qualifying renewable energy systems on commercial properties, commonly known as the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).\n\n\"Energy storage technologies are a key element of creating the energy grid of the future,\" said Tim McRae, Senior Director of Energy at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. \"Integration of these technologies will support a smarter, more reliable grid and enable the development of a new energy market structure.\"\n\nAllowing energy storage to take full advantage of the ITC is also supported by several major technology groups in the Silicon Valley, including Tesla Motors, Inc., Stem Inc., Green Charge Networks, Energy Storage Association, Silicon Valley Leadership Group and Imergy Power Systems.\n\n\"Stem strongly supports the commitment shown by Congress to expand the U.S. energy storage industry,\" said John Carrington, CEO of Stem. \"Including energy storage under the ITC would also enable enormous economic development in the U.S., creating countless jobs and new financial opportunities from coast to coast.\"\n\nThe letter also notes that alternative energy is only one use for energy storage. Energy storage also has great potential to broadly impact both the energy and transportation sectors.\n\n\"Energy storage improves the efficiency of the grid and provides synergy with solar generation and other renewables, \"said Vic Shao CEO of Green Charge Networks. \"Distributed energy storage is driving innovation and transforming U.S. energy markets and is one of the fastest-growing markets in the renewable energy sector. Broadening the ITC definition will drastically speed up market adoption.\"\n\nStorage devices have the capability to store large amounts of electricity, are deployable at any location in the country, and can not only work in concert with any form of energy generation, but can be designed specifically to provide benefits to the grid.\n\n\"Energy storage opens the path to a future of reliable, affordable, and clean electricity for all Americans,\" said Matt Roberts, Executive Director of the Energy Storage Association. \"These Representatives understand that policy has yet to catch up with technology, and we thank them for supporting greater clarity and simplicity in how IRS rules apply to energy storage. Doing so will give business owners and customers for energy storage the certainty the need to make smart market decisions.\"\n\nThe letter to Koskinen and Lew was signed by Reps.

Therefore, the simplest and straightforward online platform for the automaker would have been tesla.com, but the name has been privately registered since 1992, a time when the internet was a thing of a distant future. But it seems that Tesla has eventually managed to buy it from Stu Grossman, a computer network engineer in California, who used the domain as a private email server. According to a Whois record at DomainTools, the domain was transferred to Tesla Motors on Tuesday last week, a well thought move regarding the fact the automaker is expanding its business into energy storage systems, and there is no name more suitable than tesla.com.\n\nThe domain has previously been challenged, when in 2015 Tesla Industries, a maker of power conversions systems, accused Grossman of holding the name only to profit from it, but the claims were rejected. It is not known how much Tesla has paid to get its long-craved domain, but it is likely to be a consistent amount, as there are many such cases in which some big global companies had to buy their desired domains from private owners for a hefty price.", "\u00a9 David Paul Morris/Getty Images Ford logo Carmakers are becoming a familiar sight at tech shows, where they're rolling out new models to woo a generation of consumers who question the need for a car that only gets them from A to B.\n\nAt this week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Ford Motor Co. will unveil a new vehicle for Europe as well as in- cockpit technology, Volvo is showing off a keyless car and Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton will appear on a panel with the president of chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nEager to win over millennials who may care more about the latest Apple Inc. iPhone than a redesigned Mustang, automakers are trying to become more tech-savvy and shed their image as 20th century metal benders. The pivot toward the younger set comes amid a slowdown in China, competition from Tesla Motors Inc. -- which sends automatic software updates to the car's command center -- and a boom in ride-sharing services such as Uber that have left car companies anxious about growth and eager to try out a new crop of digital products and services.\n\n\"Carmakers have a very narrow window of opportunity to win over Generation Y,\" said Richard Viereckl, an analyst at PwC in Frankfurt who co-authored a 2015 study on connected cars. \"They're at these technology shows to portray their brands as hip, and with mounting competition from the likes of Apple, Panasonic and Sony, they're fighting to keep the attention of and access to their customers.\"\n\nBy 2022, 345 million autos worldwide will be connected to the Internet, nearly four times more than last year, according to IHS Automotive. In six years, 98 percent of the cars sold globally will be connected, up from 30 percent last year, the consulting firm said. The trend is driven by customer demand: Three in four consumers said they consider connected car services an important feature in their next vehicle purchase, AT&T Inc. and Ericsson said in a report in October.\n\nThe risk for carmakers is that Apple, Google and Microsoft Corp. will conquer the connected-car business with operating systems and apps that people are familiar with. Google and Apple already offer in-car infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and Google is at the forefront of developing self- driving cars.\n\n\"Google and Apple have a good chance as anyone at grabbing the car ecosystem,\" said Kevin Curran, a computer science professor at Ulster University in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. \"Cars today are computers with wheels, and tech companies know that field all too well.\"\n\n'Big Decisions'\n\nTo fend off the threat, carmakers are set to make \"big decisions\" over the next 24 months, striking cooperation pacts and increasing spending on research and development as well as M&A to get ahead, said Thilo Koslowski, who heads the auto practice at researcher Gartner Inc. Those who don't are at risk of being left behind, he said.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. debuted its Chevrolet Bolt electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, before taking it to the Detroit auto show a week later. Such moves are aimed at highlighting vehicles' software and Web features, with carmakers adding iPad-like dashboard touch screens and moving beyond to even more futuristic systems.\n\nGerman automakers BMW AG, Audi AG and Daimler AG last year teamed up to buy Nokia Oyj's HERE map business, a response to Google and Apple. BMW's iDrive system brings apps, radio and navigation to the dashboard, reducing knobs and buttons for a user experience that's closer to that of a smartphone. Porsche's Mission E concept car unveiled last year features eye-tracking and gesture-control functions, which include holograms that allow the driver to grab apps out of the air.\n\nNew Car\n\nAt Mobile World Congress, Ford has said it will debut a new model for the European market, unveil in-car technology and outline its latest plans under the umbrella of Ford Smart Mobility, the company's initiative encompassing areas such as connectivity, autonomous vehicles and big data. The company declined to comment on details of the new-model announcement.\n\n\"We see a world where vehicles talk to one another, drivers and vehicles communicate with the city infrastructure to relieve congestion, and people routinely share vehicles or multiple forms of transportation for their daily commute,\" Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields, who will speak at the event on Monday, said in a statement last year.\n\nIt's a tall order for automakers contending with fleet- footed tech companies. The disruption brought by the connected car is similar to what happened 100 years ago, when the automobile successfully challenged the horse and carriage industry, Koslowski said. Engineering excellence isn't enough anymore, but to appeal to the next generation of buyers a carmaker needs to show how it can enrich a consumer's digital lifestyle, he said.\n\n\"Automakers have an opportunity to make cars even more compelling and spark a renaissance of the car,\" Koslowski said. \"They are being challenged and they have to be careful that they don't turn into a horse and carriage industry.\"\n\n--With assistance from Richard Weiss and David Welch.", "Getty Images/AFP/File / Bill Pugliano\n\nElon Musk, co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motors, speaks at the 2015 Automotive News World Congress January 13, 2015 in Detroit, Michigan\n\nInstallation of the first Tesla Powerwall in South Africa is underway in Johannesburg, says authorised reseller Dako Power.\n\nThe company plans to gather and use data based on the performance of the initial unit to market the rechargeable lithium ion product when it is launched at The Solar Show Africa next month, said Peter Dalglish, managing director of Dako Power.\n\nThe Powerwall, created by South African born entrepreneur Elon Musk, has been hailed as the future of energy usage in that it stores energy for load shifting, backup power and household consumption.\n\nThe 7 kilowatt hour (kWh) daily cycle Powerwall system available in South Africa, harnesses and stores energy generated from solar panels during the day for use at night and during power outages. According to Tesla, the lithium ion Powerwall, which operates at a 92% efficiency rate, can provide 3.3kW of continuous power, the same as its peak output. It said lights per room in a typical house consume 0.1kWh of energy per hour while a refrigerator consumes 1.6kWh per day.\n\nStill, local interest in the product is \"phenomenal\". \"We're not punting the Powerwall as a return on investment product...we're not selling it versus the Eskom grid, we're selling it when there's no Eskom grid,\" Dalglish said referring to load shedding. He said the company has already received about 100 pre-launch orders.\n\nAccording to him, the biggest advantage of using the Powerwall compared to other more affordable products are the warranties. The Powerwall guarantee can be extended from 10 to 20 years while the SolarEdge inverter comes with a 25 year extended warranty. Warranties for other products typically range between 5 to 10 years.\n\nAlthough Tesla has only just started shipping the Powerwall, Musk said a second version of the product \"which will see further step changes in capabilities\" would be available in July or August this year.\n\nDalglish said news of the upgrade hasn't impacted interest in the model. \"It comes down to personality types, you get those guys are the trendsetters and want to be the first and then you get the people that choose to hang back and see how the market grows,\" he said.", "As it stands, about 30,000 people die in car crashes every year in the United States, said Mark Kopko of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.\n\n\"If you could reduce that by 90 percent, that's huge,\" he said.\n\nAutonomous cars have the capacity to do that.\n\nIn Allegheny County, that could mean a vast reduction in the roughly 12,000 crashes in 2014 -- especially of those attributed to driver error, like drunk or distracted driving and speeding.\n\nThe technology isn't a distant dream.

A Tesla spokeswoman confirmed on Friday that the company now has the domain. Punch Tesla.com into a browser and traffic is directed to Teslamotors.com.\n\nThe ever-persistent Musk got a domain that he wanted, which would give him the liberty to change the company's name to Tesla if he chooses to later on. When asked last year at the launch of Tesla Energy if he wanted to change the company's name to Tesla from Tesla Motors - to reflect that the company's gigafactory would soon be building stationary batteries - Musk said there were domain issues. Not anymore.\n\nThe move gives Tesla Motors a more broad handle on the Web just as the company is pushing beyond its electric-car business and is selling battery units for homes and power utilities.\n\nIt is not clear if Grossman sold the name to Tesla. He bought the domain years ago because of his affinity for inventor Nikola Tesla and kept it for personal use, said John Berryhill, an attorney in Pennsylvania who represented Grossman in dispute with another company, Tesla Industries, a decade ago. Grossman had been approached by many people about giving up the name, Berryhill said.\n\n\"Mr Grossman is an engineer and a big fan of Nikola Tesla,\" Berryhill said. \"He's had it, and now Tesla the auto company got it. I would surmise that this was a voluntary arrangement,\"\n\nGrossman could not be immediately reached for comment. Tesla spokeswoman Khobi Brooklyn declined to comment on the domain change beyond confirming that the company has acquired it.", "Tesla Motors is opening an office in Cape Town, South Africa, according to a number of news reports.\n\nThe office is the US-based all-electric automaker's first foray into Africa and it is starting out small with just six employees in the Cape Town office.\n\nAccording to the reports, the company is looking for an applications engineer, two sales managers for its Powerwall and Powerpack products, an analyst and a training specialist.\n\nOverseeing the office is Evan Rice, the former GreenCape chief executive who was hired by Tesla to be the company's business development manager in South Africa.\n\nCape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille, confirmed in an interview with 567 Cap Talk that Tesla will open its office in Cape Town. She added that some of Tesla's products will be in the country in \"the next month or two\".\n\nTesla is the brainchild of South African-born tech innovator Elon Musk.", "Carmakers are becoming a familiar sight at tech shows, where they're rolling out new models to woo a generation of consumers who question the need for a car that only gets them from A to B.\n\nAt this week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Ford Motor Co. will unveil a new vehicle for Europe as well as in-cockpit technology, Volvo is showing off a keyless car and Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton will appear on a panel with the president of chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nEager to win over millennials who may care more about the latest Apple Inc. iPhone than a redesigned Mustang, automakers are trying to become more tech-savvy and shed their image as 20th century metal benders. The pivot toward the younger set comes amid a slowdown in China, competition from Tesla Motors Inc. -- which sends automatic software updates to the car's command center -- and a boom in ride-sharing services such as Uber that have left car companies anxious about growth and eager to try out a new crop of digital products and services.\n\n\"Carmakers have a very narrow window of opportunity to win over Generation Y,\" said Richard Viereckl, an analyst at PwC in Frankfurt who co-authored a 2015 study on connected cars. \"They're at these technology shows to portray their brands as hip, and with mounting competition from the likes of Apple, Panasonic and Sony, they're fighting to keep the attention of and access to their customers.\"\n\nBy 2022, 345 million autos worldwide will be connected to the Internet, nearly four times more than last year, according to IHS Automotive. In six years, 98 percent of the cars sold globally will be connected, up from 30 percent last year, the consulting firm said. The trend is driven by customer demand: Three in four consumers said they consider connected car services an important feature in their next vehicle purchase, AT&T Inc. and Ericsson said in a report in October.\n\nThe risk for carmakers is that Apple, Google and Microsoft Corp. will conquer the connected-car business with operating systems and apps that people are familiar with. Google and Apple already offer in-car infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and Google is at the forefront of developing self-driving cars.\n\n\"Google and Apple have a good chance as anyone at grabbing the car ecosystem,\" said Kevin Curran, a computer science professor at Ulster University in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. \"Cars today are computers with wheels, and tech companies know that field all too well.\"\n\n'Big Decisions'\n\nTo fend off the threat, carmakers are set to make \"big decisions\" over the next 24 months, striking cooperation pacts and increasing spending on research and development as well as M&A to get ahead, said Thilo Koslowski, who heads the auto practice at researcher Gartner Inc. Those who don't are at risk of being left behind, he said.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. debuted its Chevrolet Bolt electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, before taking it to the Detroit auto show a week later. Such moves are aimed at highlighting vehicles' software and Web features, with carmakers adding iPad-like dashboard touch screens and moving beyond to even more futuristic systems.\n\nGerman automakers BMW AG, Audi AG and Daimler AG last year teamed up to buy Nokia Oyj's HERE map business, a response to Google and Apple. BMW's iDrive system brings apps, radio and navigation to the dashboard, reducing knobs and buttons for a user experience that's closer to that of a smartphone. Porsche's Mission E concept car unveiled last year features eye-tracking and gesture-control functions, which include holograms that allow the driver to grab apps out of the air.\n\nNew Car\n\nAt Mobile World Congress, Ford has said it will debut a new model for the European market, unveil in-car technology and outline its latest plans under the umbrella of Ford Smart Mobility, the company's initiative encompassing areas such as connectivity, autonomous vehicles and big data. The company declined to comment on details of the new-model announcement.\n\n\"We see a world where vehicles talk to one another, drivers and vehicles communicate with the city infrastructure to relieve congestion, and people routinely share vehicles or multiple forms of transportation for their daily commute,\" Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields, who will speak at the event on Monday, said in a statement last year.\n\nIt's a tall order for automakers contending with fleet-footed tech companies. The disruption brought by the connected car is similar to what happened 100 years ago, when the automobile successfully challenged the horse and carriage industry, Koslowski said. Engineering excellence isn't enough anymore, but to appeal to the next generation of buyers a carmaker needs to show how it can enrich a consumer's digital lifestyle, he said.\n\n\"Automakers have an opportunity to make cars even more compelling and spark a renaissance of the car,\" Koslowski said. \"They are being challenged and they have to be careful that they don't turn into a horse and carriage industry.\"\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "'If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then you are a leader,\" said John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States.\n\nNearly two centuries later these words resound in a big way, especially in this part of the world, which is facing a tectonic shift in the way countries do business and secure their future.\n\nLast week brought another important event with potential to shape the future of the region, when the leaders of Asean travelled to the United States for the first US-Asean Summit. The event itself was the usual talking shop with a totally scripted and predictable outcome. What mattered more was the symbolic value of the event, especially from Washington's perspective, in drawing 10 Southeast Asian leaders closer to the global superpower.\n\nEach individual Asean leader, of course, brought a personal and political agenda to the summit venue in southern California. Beyond the well documented photo opportunities, each leader wanted to send a message to the public back home and establish his country's name and his own as a leader with vision.\n\nAmong the Asean members, the countries with leaders dealing from a position of strength include Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Brunei. Myanmar's lame-duck president skipped the event as he will soon step aside for a new regime, while the president of the Philippines will also leave office after elections in May. The Communist politburos of Laos and Vietnam have just anointed new leaders, while Malaysia's prime minister is grimly hanging on in the face of mounting calls for his administration to come clean about graft allegations.\n\nAmong the stronger leadership countries, one can totally discount Brunei since whatever the Sultan does is greeted with nothing less than worship at home. One of the world's richest monarchs, he has no need to look abroad for favours for his country or his subjects, though even he recognises that Brunei must start to diversify away from its heavy reliance on oil and gas.\n\nWhat was surprising, and encouraging, was that the leaders of Indonesia and Singapore took the time to travel to Silicon Valley, a few hundred kilometres north of the summit venue, ahead of the main event. There they met with people who could rightly be called the new world leaders.\n\nDuring his visit Indonesian President Joko Widodo played virtual ping pong with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Games aside, he also asked Mr Zuckerberg to help make Indonesia the largest digital economy in Southeast Asia, in a market expected to be worth US$130 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, meanwhile, completed the Silicon Valley equivalent of a Grand Slam, visiting not only Facebook but also meeting Tim Cook of Apple, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Eric Schmidt of Alphabet and Sundar Pichai of Google.\n\nIn a world where many people place more faith in the likes of Mark Zuckerberg than they do in politicians, a visit by a political leader to Silicon Valley helps build a degree of confidence in his country and in the commitment of its leaders to embrace the modern age.\n\nThailand's leader, on the other hand, enjoys almost unlimited power. In theory he could use Section 44, the \"dictator clause\" of the junta-drafted constitution, to order a major economic transformation. We've heard lots of talk about the digital economy from his administration but we've seen little action. A visit by Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha to Silicon Valley could have done wonders to prove to people that he gets the 21st century.\n\nWe'd like to ask Gen Prayut why he missed an opportunity to meet with some iconic world figures, but with his handlers now limiting the media to four questions a day lest the general blow his top, we don't like our chances.\n\nWhen one is the leader of the country, it is important to lead by example. While some of his Southeast Asian leaders are walking their talk, we in Thailand are stuck with a foul-tempered soldier whose outbursts bring ridicule to the country on the world stage.\n\nAs John Quincy Adams said, a true leader is one who inspires people. If our leader truly understood Thailand's enthusiasm for all things digital, and had a sense of how much exciting IT talent the country possesses, he would know that the public wanted far more than a picture of him shaking hands with Barack Obama.", "Should the market fall further from here, there's plenty of money on the sidelines that can come in to buy up cheap stocks.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch says cash levels among world's fund managers are at their highest level since 2001.\n\n15 years ago the world was grappling with the 'tech wreck' after the Nasdaq bubble burst and then 9/11.\n\nThese days it's concerns over China and slow economic growth.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald also reports, 'The report's findings also confirm anecdotal evidence in Australia of fund managers raising their allocations to cash this year amid wild swings in equity markets.'\n\nFund managers want to see earnings growth. The good news is there's some of it out there, if you're following the company results.\n\nTake Burson Group [ASX: BAP] for example. Burson's main business is auto parts, accessories and servicing. They distribute to both the retail and trade sectors. Their biggest brand is the Autobarn store network.\n\nAccording to the Australian Financial Review, the company supplies 500,000 different car parts to mechanics and other chains.\n\nThe company released its half-year results to the market yesterday. Things look very good if you happen to be a shareholder. Net profit was up 77.9% and the interim dividend up 25%.\n\nThe company raised its full year profit outlook about 4% based off the first half results and strong trading in January. I take that as a positive for Australia's economy.\n\nThe car sector in general is very interesting to watch right now. Both the UK and US are seeing record car sales.\n\nThen there's the development Tesla is driving in the electric car space. This is causing one sector of the resource market to go haywire: lithium.\n\nWith thanks to my colleague Jody Chudley from Outstanding Investments, here's why:\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs estimates, just a 1% increase in the penetration rate of electric cars would cause total global lithium demand to increase by 50%.\n\nIf you haven't heard, lithium is one of the few resources that has actually avoided the general commodity bloodbath over the last few years.\n\n'The only things hotter than Western Australia's scorched Outback are the mining companies preparing to supply the lithium needed by the likes of Nissan Motor Co. and Tesla Motors Inc. to meet booming demand for electric cars.'\n\nBloomberg cites the fact that two of Australia's five best-performing stocks in the past 18 months are developing lithium material operations.\n\nOne of those is bound to be General Mining [ASX:GMM] which is up over 1000% since February 2015.\n\nOf course, the positive tailwinds behind lithium are not news to the market. That's why the stocks in this sector have been running.\n\nMost of them have made their initial run. But there's still potential for them to move higher from here.\n\nThe lithium stocks that do trade on the ASX are small and mostly speculative. The majority of them are still exploring and raising funds to move from identifying the resource they have to feasibility studies or actual production.\n\nThey will need to. The trend behind electric cars is not going anywhere. Car manufacturers need a guaranteed and secure supply. The capital investment these companies are making in plants and equipment is just too big to leave anything to chance.\n\nJust consider Tesla. The company is building a new US$5 billion factory in the Nevada desert.\n\nNot a regular factory though. Tesla chief and billionaire Elon Musk calls it his 'Gigafactory'.\n\nWhat they plan to do there is on a scale the world has never seen before.\n\nBy 2017, they will produce more lithium batteries in this one factory alone than the entire rest of the world combined.\n\nNot only that, Elon Musk says there is a need for hundreds more lithium battery Gigafactories.\n\nTesla's next quarterly earnings update is due after the US market closes on February 20.\n\nIt will be notable how lithium stocks react to that. Sales of Tesla cars are important to this trend.\n\nThe stocks in the lithium sector could be one of the most interesting sectors to watch in 2016 as individual projects develop.\n\nMy colleague Terence Duffy and I produced a report on this sector called Electric Gold. We profiled seven of the lithium stocks listed on the ASX."]}, "Airbus": {"2016-02-19": ["Shutterstock photo\n\nBy Jon Ostrower\n\nBoeing Co. said Friday that it received a license from the U.S. government to begin commercial discussions with Iranian airlines, opening the door to what could be the first U.S. jet deliveries to the Islamic Republic since the 1970s.\n\nIranian carriers have among the oldest fleets in global aviation following decades of sanctions that have left them unable to leverage an advantageous geographical location and a domestic market of nearly 80 million people.

Those fires led to $2 million in property damage, including destruction of two homes and an automobile. The agency said many of those incidents would not have occurred if the hoverboards met existing standards.\n\nConcerns that lithium-ion batteries used in the hoverboards could spark fires have led to bans by several airlines and college campuses.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nAlso in Business\n\n\u25cf U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in January as the rising costs of housing and health care were largely offset by cheaper oil. But annual inflation showed signs of accelerating. The Labor Department said Friday that prices rose 1.4 percent over the past 12 months, compared with a year ago, when annual inflation was close to zero. Consumer prices climbed at the fastest annual rate since October 2014. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.3 percent in January. Over the past 12 months, core inflation has climbed 2.2 percent. Housing expenses -- which account for a third of the consumer price index -- have risen 3.2 percent from a year ago. Prices for medical care, airfare, clothing and motor vehicles also rose in January, while food expenses were flat.\n\n\u25cf William Dudley has been reappointed president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as expected, giving him another five years as one of the U.S. central bank's most influential policymakers. Members of the New York Fed's board not affiliated with private banks voted to reappoint Dudley to a term beginning March 1. Dudley began the job during the financial crisis in 2009. He is a dovish monetary policymaker with a permanent vote on U.S. interest rates.\n\n\u25cf Verizon Communications, which launched its pay-TV plan \"FiOS Custom TV\" last year to let viewers choose bundles of channels, has redesigned the offering.

The move was based on customer feedback, a Verizon spokesman said. The first package, \"Essentials,\" has over 190 channels, including the big four U.S. networks -- Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- with no sports offerings. The second package, \"Sports & more,\" has more than 160 channels, including ESPN and regional sports, plus non-sports channels such as the Cartoon Network.\n\n\u25cf Facebook has redesigned its popular Messenger app so that several people can use it on the same smartphone or tablet without relinquishing their privacy.

Nearly half of the 40 were for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), and nine were for aircraft.\n\nOverall, more deals were inked this year, up 14 per cent from 44 at the last Airshow.\n\nEarly in the week, analysts had flagged expectations of a more subdued tally, pointing to economic headwinds and the dramatic plunge in oil prices, which translates to little incentive to phase out older planes for new, fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\nSouth-east Asian carriers, in particular, appeared to play it cool after the heady buying sprees of recent years. There are more than 1,500 existing orders from the region's airlines, accounting for some 13 per cent of the global order book.\n\nThis is being compounded by over-capacity in this market, which is putting downward pressure on yields.\n\nBut at the Airshow this week, industry heavyweights such as Airbus, Boeing and Embraer dismissed talk that business from the region could take a hit as regional powerhouse China reports slowing growth.\n\nInstead, they pointed to sturdy demand in the Asia-Pacific, fuelled by an emerging middle class with rising disposable income, and substantial backlogs.\n\nAirbus chief operating officer John Leahy said at a briefing this week: \"The middle class of the Asia-Pacific will be driving the world going forward. Unless you want to predict a global economic collapse, aviation will keep growing.\"\n\nThe European planemaker's backlog stands at more than 6,830 planes; last year's net orders had hit 1,080 aircraft, valued at US$141.6 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, US-based Boeing projects that the Asia-Pacific will need 14,550 aircraft over the next 20 years, more than a third of the 39,050 aircraft required globally.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last Sunday, International Air Transport Association chief Tony Tyler noted that travel in China has remained robust despite the slowdown.\n\nStill, the multi-billion blockbuster deals signed in 2014 were missing in action this week; for example, Amedeo's purchase of 20 Airbus A380 double-decker jets worth US$8.3 billion, VietJet snapping up 63 A320 family aircraft for US$6.4 billion, India's Air Costa plonking down nearly US$3 billion for 50 of Embraer's E2 jets and Nok Air scooping up 15 single-aisle Boeing 737s worth US$1.45 billion.\n\nInstead, this year's modest tally of US$12.3 billion included Philippine Airlines' order for six Airbus A350-900s worth US$1.85 billion at list price, Beijing-based Okay Airways committing to 12 B737s for US$1.3 billion and Miami-based leasing company Aerolease Aviation's letter of intent for 10 Mitsubishi Regional Jets for US$940 million. (Airlines typically get a discount off list price for sizeable orders)\n\nIn addition, Vietjet ordered around US$3 billion worth of Pratt & Whitney's PurePower Geared Turbofan engines for its 63 Airbus A320neo and A321 aircraft.\n\nBoeing also managed to squeeze in an order on the last trade day - typically a quiet one - for four Boeing 737 Max 8s worth US$450 million at list price, from Papua New Guinea flag carrier Air Niugini.\n\nThe 10 disclosed deals totalling US$12.3 billion consisted of four aircraft orders, two MRO contracts, two engine deals and two relating to the defence segment.\n\nExperia Events managing director Leck Chet Lam said that the Singapore Airshow exceeded expectations this year. \"If you look at trade visitors, VIP delegations, the number of deals announced - they're up. The key elements that we look at are on an upward trend.\"\n\nBased on early estimates, the number of trade visitors rose nearly 10 per cent from more than 40,000 two years ago; the number of VIP delegations rose 3-5 per cent.

The planemaker will still need a separate license to complete any commercial jetliner sales.Europe's Airbus Group SE, which faced fewer restrictions, grabbed an early lead with a $27 billion order announced on the day nuclear sanctions were eased last month. While European aerospace rivals began scoping out potential sales last year, Boeing wasn't allowed to veer beyond safety-related items such as the aircraft maintenance manuals it sold to Iran Air Tours during the fourth quarter.Boeing said its initial foray into the Iranian market is following a licensing process outlined by government officials.\"We understand that the situation in the region is complicated and ever changing and we will continue to follow the U.S. government's guidance,\" the planemaker said Friday.Boeing faces risks and uncertain rewards as it vies with Airbus and others to replace Iran's museum-vintage fleet. There's the prospect of political backlash, given the Iranian leaders' penchant for anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli rhetoric. Boeing also may need to leave wiggle room to back out of any deals for potential orders if the next U.S. president decides to reinstate sanctions.\"Selling to Iran is a lot different than selling to Dubai,\" says Loren Thompson, aerospace analyst at the Lexington Institute. \"They may be in the same part of the world, but the leaders in Tehran are very controversial in Washington.\"The potential demand left untapped after Airbus's 118-plane bonanza isn't clear. While Iranian leaders have spoken of a need for hundreds of jets, aviation consultant Ascend Worldwide sees an \"initial replacement opportunity equivalent\" to the 160 aircraft currently in service in Iran, said Rob Morris, head of the consultancy.\"Assuming that the thaw does indeed continue, the potential opportunity may be significantly greater than this though,\" Morris said.One measure of the potential is Turkey, Iran's similar-size neighbor with a vastly more developed tourism industry, he said. Turkey has 450 commercial jets in service and more than 320 more planes on firm order. Over a decade, that fleet may grow to about 650 planes, Morris said.Western manufacturers still don't have unfettered access to Iran's 78 million consumers. Rather, companies like Boeing are cleared to do business in Iran by an office of the U.S. Treasury Department that enforces economic and trade sanctions. Europe's Airbus, Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. and Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA are also required to gain permission if American companies provide more than 10 percent of their aircraft components.As part of the sanctions lifted Jan. 16, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control established procedures to allow the sale of wide-body, narrow-body, regional and commuter planes, along with related parts, for passenger travel. Many other transactions are still banned, including selling cargo planes, state aircraft, drones, and military planes.Boeing and its rivals could also lose their licenses if a middle man or counter-party turns out to have unsavory ties or is blacklisted by the U.S. government.\"This is not a free-for-all,\" said Adam Smith, a former senior sanctions official for the Obama administration who is now of counsel to Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in Washington. \"It is a very controlled situation.\"The stringent requirements aren't limited to airframe manufacturers. General Electric Co., the world's largest maker of jet engines, has also applied to do business in Iran, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for the company's aviation unit. The license would cover new-equipment sales as well as maintenance and repair work, where engine manufacturers make most of their money.GE's application was submitted in preparation for opportunities arising as the airframers open talks, Kennedy said. GE Aviation, through its CFM International joint venture with France's Safran SA, makes engines powering many aircraft including Boeing's 737 and models in Airbus's A320 family.Despite Airbus's head start, there is still opportunity for Boeing to nab sales of its wide-body 777-300ER jets, Ascend's Morris said. And uncertain financing prospects for Iran's carriers combined with deliveries spread out a decade or more have some skeptical that all of the sales in the Airbus pact will materialize.\"It's what we used to call a letter of enthusiasm,\" said Adam Pilarski, a former aerospace executive who is now senior vice president with consultant Avitas Inc. \"It's not even a letter of intent.\"Boeing has ample time to carve out its foothold in Iran, Pilarski said. \"This is a big market. They need lots of planes.\"", "SINGAPORE (AP) -- Organizers of the Singapore Airshow said $12.3 billion in airplane deals were signed at the event this week, a sharp drop from the last show in 2014.\n\nLeck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, said Friday that this year's figure was comprised of 10 deals, with another 40 made at undisclosed values.

Organizers released this year's total which covers commercial, private and defense deals after the three-day trade period ended Friday.\n\nModest airplane orders for Boeing and Airbus announced earlier in the week hinted at a lull in demand, as overflowing order books at the manufacturers and a fall in oil prices spurred airlines to keep their older less fuel-efficient planes for longer.\n\nA formation of T-50 fighter jets, flown by the South Korean Black Eagles aerial acrobatic team, perform a maneuver during an aerial display at the Singapore Airshow on Feb. 16, 2016.

Carolina jobs could all be shipped to China shows a lack of understanding of the airplane business, experts said. Also, Tim's Cascade marks 30 years of churning out potato chips.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump warned South Carolina audiences this past week that Boeing's prized manufacturing complex in their state could soon be gone, its 7,500 jobs shipped off because \"it will be cheaper to build in China.\"\n\nPeople with a better grasp of the airplane business don't share Trump's concern.\n\n\"I think he's somewhat badly confused about our industry,\" said Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group consulting firm outside Washington D.C. \"If anything there's a trend toward insourcing, moving work back to the U.S.\"\n\nAnother leading aviation observer, Adam Pilarski of Avitas, agreed: \"The whole thing appeals to people who have absolutely, totally no idea about the industry... It's absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nTrump's appearance Feb. 17 in Walterboro, S.C., put him about 50 miles northwest of Boeing's growing industrial complex in North Charleston.\n\nWhat he told the crowd, according to CSPAN's video of the Feb. 17 event:\n\n\"Boeing just had a big order from China, but China is making them build a massive airline facility, right? Massive, like bigger than anything you've seen. You feel good about Boeing right now? Tell me in five years...\"\n\n\"They are going to build that plant, they are going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you're gonna be reading a big front-page story, all over the place, that Boeing is going to leave South Carolina, they're going to make all their planes in China. Because that's what they do.\n\n\"And our leaders aren't smart enough to stop it, OK?\"\n\nOn the other hand, Trump added, if he's president, \"You'll be fine, don't worry about it.\"\n\nAt a later rally right in North Charleston, he doubled down on his dire scenario, according to the local Post and Courier:\n\n\"It will be cheaper to build in China,\" he said. \"Then all of a sudden your Boeing plant in this area will be gone, and we don't want that to happen. And a politician will never be able to stop it. Because they're all talk and no action. They don't have a clue.\"\n\nAboulafia called Trump's scenario of moving airplane manufacturing to China \"bizarre.\"\n\nBoeing did agree in November to establish an interior finishing plant in China where things such as seats will be installed in 737s before they are painted and delivered to Chinese airline customers.\n\nBut unlike Airbus, which is doing final assembly on single-aisle planes in China, \"Boeing gave them some paint work that was embarrassingly trumped up, exaggerated,\" Aboulafia said dismissively.\n\nNobody should be worried that the company gave away any \"strategic carpet-stapling capabilities,\" he joked.\n\nPilarski noted that industries that pursue the lowest-wage workforce are now leaving China in favor of nations such as Vietnam. More importantly, he said, \"In aviation, cheap labor is not the major element because you need technical skills and so on.\"\n\nBoeing's North Charleston complex is proof that outsourcing major aircraft structures and opening new factories is hardly a surefire strategy. On the heavily outsourced 787 Dreamliner, the company was forced to buy out its major supplier partners in South Carolina. It experienced a rocky startup for its own assembly operation, too.\n\nAboulafia noted that after having Japanese partners build the 787's wings, Boeing brought that back in-house with the 777X wings, to be made in Everett.\n\nThe U.S. share of the world's aircraft output, by value, has held steady at around 53 percent for several years, according to Teal data.\n\nChina's share is negligible. And despite its ambitions to build airliners, \"so far they haven't been hugely successful,\" said Pilarski.\n\nIn South Carolina Trump has also denounced air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier, which said this month it would move 2,100 jobs from Indiana to Mexico. The businessman candidate said that if he were president, he would slap a 35 percent tax on the company's air conditioners shipped back to the U.S.\n\nIt's not clear how the growing number of South Carolina factory workers who are employed by foreign companies may react to Trump's economic nationalism.\n\nFor instance, 100 miles from Walterboro is Camden, where appliance manufacturer Haier became the first Chinese company to open a U.S. factory. Last summer it announced plans to add 410 jobs as it nearly doubles the size of its plant, which makes refrigerators and freezers.\n\nAnd another 125 miles down the road is Spartanburg, S.C., where BMW in 2014 declared it would spend $1 billion to double its capacity, creating the German carmaker's largest factory worldwide.

The reality isn't that important.\"\n\n-- Rami Grunbaum: rgrunbaum@seattletimes.com\n\nFor years, Tim's Cascade potato chips have been a staple on many local grocery store shelves, its red-and-white original lightly salted chips sitting alongside trendier, fun flavors, including wasabi and parmesan and garlic, that come and go.\n\nThis year, the Algona-based Tim's Cascade Snacks is marking its 30th anniversary by bringing back one of its first flavors: the hot dog-and-mustard flavored Coney Island Chips.\n\n\"Tim and I rolled that out in 1990 as a limited edition,\" remembers Jeff Leichleiter, general manager of Tim's Cascade Snacks, who co-founded the company with Tim Kennedy. Kennedy retired in 2005 and sold the company to Birds Eye Foods.\n\nThe flavor did well but the company decided to cycle the flavor out, as it does periodically with some flavors.\n\nThey decided to bring it back for the anniversary because \"it's a fun one,\" Leichleiter said. And \"it's just in time for spring training and barbecues.\"\n\nOver the years the company, which has grown to employ 105 people and uses some 40 million pounds of potatoes a year, has brought out \"special batch\" limited edition flavors each year.\n\nThis year, in addition to the Coney Island flavor, the company is introducing Hawaiian Island Lemon.\n\nWhy lemon-flavored potato chips?\n\n\"It's kind of trendy,\" especially in the food service business where these types of trends start out, Leichleiter said.\n\nThe company has found that different flavors appeal to different parts of the country.\n\nFor instance, a barbecue chip is not just a barbecue chip. Texans prefer a Mesquite barbecue flavor while Pacific Northwesterners prefer a wood smoked, less salty flavor -- resulting in different barbecue flavors named after different regions.\n\nTim's Cascade Snacks is now a subsidiary of Parsippany, N.J.-based Pinnacle Foods. For the quarter ended Sept. 27, 2015, Pinnacle reported that its specialty foods division, which includes Tim's, saw net sales decline 13.9 percent to $82.2 million.

He writes full-time and lives in Woodland Hills, California.\n\nA March 25, 2014 article from the Associated Press quotes Alabama Assistant Attorney General Clay Crenshaw saying that 16 death row inmates \"have exhausted [all] appeals and are awaiting execution.\" Today, the exact number among the 185 inmates on Alabama's death row whose last remaining hope is clemency is unknown. However, even following the execution of Christopher Brooks on January 21, the number of inmates \"out of court,\" with no further avenues of appeal, is at least 16, and it may be higher. This means that anytime it wants, the AG's office can, following the two year moratorium on executions that officially ended with Mr. Brooks, ask the courts to schedule 16 or more executions in a row.\n\nThe question is: Whatever personal beliefs Alabamians hold on the morality of the death penalty, is the scheduled killing of 16 or more people - one right after the other - a risk worth subjecting Alabama's fragile economy to?\n\nConsider the steady drumbeat of publicized death and denunciations from around the United States and the world that would result, with the possibility, each time, of a gruesome botch, like the infamous Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett on April 29, 2014. Generating an avalanche of negative press abroad, reporters witnessing Lockett's execution said he \"writhed, groaned, and convulsed\" taking 43 minutes to die.\n\nImagine 16 or more potential Lockett-like executions lined up - like ducks in a row - in Alabama. Picture the accompanying emotional baggage with each detail about the condemned, the crimes of which they were convicted, and the nitty gritty of each of their executions painstakingly picked through by the press . . . . How much negative publicity would Alabama see as a result? How much condemnation from foreign countries who abhor the death penalty would it reap - countries whose investment dollars Alabama's slowly rebuilding economy depends upon?\n\nA June 2014 article by Michael Tomberlin titled, \"Alabama, Birmingham benefit from growing levels of foreign direct investment,\" noted that \"[the five top source countries of companies investing in Birmingham as a percent of jobs are Germany (14 percent), Japan (12.9) Canada (11), Spain (8.8) and France (7.7).\" Furthermore, \"[t]he five leading source countries companies investing in Alabama as a percent of the jobs are Germany (16.2 percent), Japan (13.5), Republic of Korea (9.6), England (8.6) and Canada (7.5).\" That means just a little less than two years ago, at least 41.5 percent of foreign investment in Birmingham came from foreign countries that long ago abolished the death penalty and, at least 32.3 percent of foreign investment in all of Alabama, likewise, came from abolitionist countries.\n\nIn addition to the already well-documented costs of capital punishment then - to Alabamians' morals, the judicial system and taxes (see the Equal Justice Initiative's website for detailed studies and support on all these) - can Alabama really risk ramping executions up when doing so will offend, even alienate, so many potential foreign investors - not to mention the Pope?\n\nThe University of Alabama's Center for Business and Economic Research is already predicting slow growth for Alabama's economy in 2016, and so, even if folks don't care so much about what foreigners think of Alabama's refusal to, as the New York Times Editorial Board put it on January 16, \"join the rest of the civilized world and end the death penalty,\" don't Alabamians at least want those foreign dollars? Isn't it great that foreign companies like Mercedes-Benz and Airbus have chosen to invest in Alabama? Wouldn't it be awful if the state's rekindled lust for executions drove them, and foreign companies like them, away?\n\nWe already know Europeans hate the death penalty by their refusal to ship lethal injection drugs to the US and, just recently, after Saudi Arabia held mass executions, it was reported on January 15 by Eve Hartley of the Huffington Post that, \"the brutal Saudi justice system [had] strain[ed] relations between\" Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.\n\nPutting aside all the very many good reasons already advanced to end the death penalty, isn't the most obvious in Alabamians' wallets? Is there really so much green in there already that accelerating - instead of taking immediate steps now to end the death penalty - is worth it?", "* Project has wider implications for Big Three engine makers\n\n* Pratt & Whitney wants to join project, snubs ex-partner Rolls\n\n* Rolls-Royce 'not closing any door'\n\n* General Electric stays mum, said to work on new engine\n\nBy Tim Hepher\n\nSINGAPORE, Feb 19 Aircraft engine makers are placing bets that could reshape their industry for decades as Boeing weighs a novel design for an airplane with 240-250 seats - a neglected area of the jet market.\n\nThe plane is designed to fill a slender gap between narrow-body jets, which typically have 150-200 seats, and intercontinental planes with 250 or more.

The technology aims to increase efficiency but critics say it adds complexity.\n\nEarly signs are mixed. Qatar Airways threatened this week to cancel an order due to technical glitches.\n\nWAIT AND SEE\n\nRolls-Royce has not ruled out working with Pratt on the new jet, a testbed for technology that could reopen the door to the narrow-body market in time for the next new designs in 2030.\n\n\"We are not closing any door but we are not active on any door. We are kind of neutral and it is more 'wait and see' on where this market is going,\" Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace, told Reuters.\n\nSitting back with the least interest in upsetting the status quo is GE, the world's largest engine manufacturer, which is strong in both small and large markets.\n\nIndustry analysts nonetheless speculate GE is working on the new geared engines, but GE is not showing its hand.\n\nGE has a \"roadmap of technologies, including advanced materials and designs, to position us for new engine opportunities,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\nBoeing's idea is not without risks.\n\nBuilding a new engine could cannibalise existing sales. GE has the biggest share of all, Pratt is doing well out of the A321 and Rolls-Royce could see some wide-body business affected.\n\nBut after busting budgets on ambitious designs in the past decade, planemakers have little fresh on their drawing boards, and few suppliers can afford to stay out of the next round.\n\n\"It is better to cannibalise your own market than have someone do it for you,\" Aboulafia said.\n\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Neil Fullick)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nInsight - The great engine game behind new Boeing jet project - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "Today, 70 percent of regional flights in Indonesia with an average distance of 350 kilometers are served by a 50-seater ATR 42, or a 78-seater ATR 72 aircraft.\n\nStill, with Indonesia's air travel market set to double by 2020 and quadruple by 2030, aspirations to command the Indonesian commercial aviation market lives on.\n\nState-owned Dirgantara Indonesia, the direct descendant of aircraft manufacturer Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) in the '80s and '90s, and National Space and Aviation Agency (Lapan), are gearing towards developing a 60-seater N245 that will go head-to-head with the ATR 42.\n\nMeanwhile, Regio Aviasi Industri, a privately held company affiliated with B.J. Habibie and his son Ilham Habibie, are also eying the market, having completed a preliminary design of the 92-seater turboprop R80.\n\nGrowing Market\n\nIlham, who is a commissioner at Regio, did not shy away from announcing the company's underlying goal to take over market share from the ATR 72.\n\n\"Their planes are smaller. Our planes are more efficient and more modern, and use the most [advanced] technology,\" Ilham told reporters on the sidelines of the 2016 Singapore Airshow.\n\nATR still has a backlog of at least 65 aircraft to deliver to Indonesia over the next three years. But beyond that, the market is up for grabs. It is projected that the number of air travelers in Indonesia will rise to 137 million by 2020 from 60 million currently, according to projections by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Indonesia will also be one of the top five world aviation markets by 2034, boasting 270 million passengers, IATA projects.\n\nThree local airlines, including NAM Air, a unit of Indonesia's third-largest airline Sriwijaya Air, Kalimantan-based Kalstar Aviation and Trigana Air Service, have placed orders for 145 aircraft from Regio.\n\nThe three airlines have also been involved in the design stages and have already listed their complaints with existing turboprop models. This has allowed the company's engineers to consider their input and to improve the R80 design, Ilham said.\n\nRegio aims for the first flight to be ready in 2019, depending on the company's ability to secure funding from backers for the detailed design and building the prototype.\n\nIlham said the R80 needs $700 million to be developed from scratch, but he opted not to elaborate on how much funding the company would still require to build a complete prototype.\n\nCapable Ecosystem\n\nRegio has made a strategic partnership with Dirgantara Indonesia to help with the R80 design. It has also tied up with other local manufacturers from the Indonesia Aircraft Component Manufacturing Association (Inacom) to help with the supply of the parts.\n\n\"Thanks to an early investment in the area decades ago, Indonesia actually has a wealth of human resources to build aircraft,\" Ilham said.\n\nAde Yuyu Wahyuna, vice president of business development at Dirgantara Indonesia, echoed Ilham's sentiments.\n\nThe company is assigning a local engineer and Lapan is looking for a way to remove the ramp door from its CN235 military aircraft in order to develop it into a commercial version, the N245.\n\n\"I always told the team that the aircraft must perform better than the ATR 42 and do that at a lower operating cost. Otherwise, I would not bother selling them,\" Ade said.\n\nBy choosing to modify an existing plane instead of designing one from scratch, Dirgantara Indonesia is able to save up to 85 percent on development costs. Additionally, the company projects that the N245 will be certified by the end of 2019.\n\nAde said the N245 has the potential to become an aircraft to serve the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), encouraging synergy between the neighboring nations that could spur the aviation industry in the region.\n\n\"We are the only [country in Asean] that has the manufacturing capabilities [to produce aircraft]. But Malaysia is good in maintenance, Thailand in finishing delivery, and the Philippines has a good pilot training program. This will be an ideal project for Asean connectivity,\" Ade said.\n\nIndustry Minister Saleh Husin said the government plans to provide more support to the aerospace industry, among others, by establishing aerospace manufacturing complexes and providing tax breaks for aerospace component imports.\n\nDoubts\n\nWhile progress in the development of the aircraft is promising, some are concerned whether they will actually be able to find buyers upon completion.\n\n\"Financing is still a problem for the airlines. Local manufacturers want to get paid in cash, so that they can immediately continue production, but airlines are often only capable of paying in instalments,\" Inacom chairman Andi Alisjahbana said. \"Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers often come with a complete financing package.\"\n\nThe Lion Group's latest $1 billion order of 40 ATR aircraft in 2014 was financed by banks in France and Italy, the countries where the aircraft were assembled, and from Canada, where their Pratt & Whitney engines are produced. Additionally, the incentive is that the industry sustains thousands of jobs in the respective countries.\n\nSo, it's not surprising that ATR has not yet shown any signs of feeling threatened by the Indonesian competition. After all, the joint venture between Airbus and Italy's Finmeccanica now holds a 37 percent share of the below-90-seat regional aircraft market globally, and is still growing.\n\n\"I've been hearing about new regional projects many times before, in India, in China and in Indonesia. But there is little to no news about them. So I cannot tell [whether it is] credible,\" said David Vargas, head of ATR media relations.\n\n\"Still definitely this turboprop market is huge. A decade ago they said the turboprop would die, but now you can see the number. This is definitely the market you want to be in,\" David said.", "Singapore Airlines Ltd. is optimistic about its prospects in the Philippines this year on strong domestic economy, its executive said.\n\n\"I think the outlook of the Philippine market is quite encouraging, I think the Philippine economy is one of those, which is relatively healthy.

What a tall order, I just as soon realized!\n\nBut, if I say so myself - doing so without a jot of prejudice - I must admit that the Magufuli Administration is NOT only overrated; it is also OVERLY overrated - pardon the clich\u00e9 here! This is generally on account of the fact that recentTanzanian Governments never delivered on their overinflated election pledges to take the country to Seventh Heaven on Cloud Nine!\n\nIndeed, this phenomenon isn't particularly peculiar to the Dr. Magufuli Presidency of what is the Fifth-Phase Government in the series beginning with Political Independence in 1961. As the Sisters of Fate would have it, all the five Governments have been led by the veteran, 'Never-Say-Die political Party of the Revolution, Man-and Boy!' (Chama cha Mapinduzi: CcM).\n\nBasically, the first two Governments of Founder President Julius Nyerere (1962-85) and his immediate successor, President Ally-Hassan Mwinyi (1985-95), were relatively modest and realistic in their socio-economic developmental pledges.\n\nMwalimu Nyerere sought to create an autarky via his Arusha Declaration and TANU Policy on Socialism & Self-Reliance proclaimed on Feb. 5, 1967... And the Mwinyi Government screwed that into the ground by the 1992 Zanzibar Declaration (on Personal Wealth Creation for the Elite!)\n\nBut - following the resurrection of multiparty politics in 1995, and the quinquennial multiparty polls beginning with the October 1995 electoral charade - performance by the Government-of-the-Day has never been anywhere near to matching the recklessly exaggerated election campaign pledges which propelled presidential aspirants to power in the first place!\n\nSo, Tanzania had President Benjamin Mkapa (1995-2005) who touted Open and Transparent Government ('Ukweli na Uwazi')... Thereafter, his Administration went on to enter into a bazillion public procurement and private investment deals which were shrouded in total mystery - much like State Secrets!\n\nThat's why and how Tanzanians continue to be bilked blind by foreign 'dealers' in lucrative areas of the Economy like the extractives sector, and public procurement: the BAe Systems radar purchase; Independent Power Producers...\n\nLikewise for Mkapa's successor at State House, President Jakaya Kikwete (2005-15) who pledged 'a Better Life for Every Tanzanian in double-quick time ('Maisha bora kwa kila Mtanzania kwa ari, kasi na Nguvu ZAID!'\n\nIn the event, Kikwete 'won' the Presidency with a whopping 82 per cent of the valid votes cast - a majority exceeded only by President Nyerere in the mono-party political system of yore (1965-90)!\n\nA decade later, ordinary Tanzanians are hapless eyewitnesses to living examples of an even more impoverished citizenry in a country whose economy is said to grow at seven per cent annually... But a country which remains home to the world's 20 poorest populations, despite it's phenomenal endowment in terms of natural resources and comparative advantages... Sheeeeeesh!\n\nThen President John Pombe Magufili nimbly took Centre Stage post-the October 25 elections last year - albeit doing so with a drastically reduced voter majority of 58 per cent, compared to Kikwete's 82 per cent in the 2005 elections!\n\nCandidate Magufuli's campaign pledges border on the legendary. Seeking to distance himself from the seemingly-incorrigible CcM which was rapidly becoming unpopular with ordinary Tanzanians, Magufuli pledged to change the way Tanzania is governed. He'd transform the country from a fourth-rate, failing state to Shangri-La by purging the Government of corrupt, inefficient and otherwise negative elements, etc, etc...\n\nA hundred days later... Oh, well: what can one say regarding Dr Magufuli's performance in a mere fraction of his 5-year term at the helm in the wheelhouse of the Ship of State?\n\nIndeed, I'm inclined to respect the views of the likes of the politically-venerable Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru who has been in active politics for 60 years dating back to the pre-Independence (1961) days. Asked by a Reporter to comment on the 100-Days fad vis-\u00e0-vis President Magufuli, 'The Kingunge' simply declined to do so - a development that's pregnant with mystery!\n\nFair enough...\n\nBut, I'll go one up on Kingunge and comment on one of Dr Magufuli's initiatives: to raise Tsh1trn from accelerated adjudication of 442 cases pending in the Courts since 2010! Tsh750bn of that is earmarked for purchasing six exotic 'Airbus' aircraft for the ailing state carrier Air-Tanzania Company Ltd (ATCL).\n\nWell, my earnest request to the President: he should redirect the funds to paying long-outstanding arrears for Govt. teachers and former Tanzanian employees of the original East African Community (EAC-I) - these latter dating back to 1977!\n\nBoth are owed around Tsh400bn, a sum that'd still leave ATCL with enough funds for three 'Airbuses,' for Gawd's sake!\n\nDoing this has certain positives. One: the teachers would heavily factor positively in the success of President Magufuli's free, quality Education for all programme... And, secondly: thousands of EAC-I workers and hundreds of thousands of their dependents would effectively be financially-included in developing the Economy.", "Bombardier's C-Series100 takes off on its maiden test flight at the company's facility on September 16, 2013 in Mirabel, Que. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz More from L. Ian MacDonald available here.\n\nThere are several major files confronting the new Liberal government that need only one-word titles. ISIS. Refugees. Climate. Pipelines. Deficit.\n\nThere's another one that threatens to drive a wedge through the Liberal caucus between its Ontario and Quebec MPs, particularly those representing Toronto and Montreal: Bombardier.\n\nThe Quebec government has just invested $1 billion in Bombardier's signature C-Series passenger jet, which is running two years behind schedule and, at $5 billion in costs to date, is $2 billion over budget.\n\nBombardier and Quebec are asking Ottawa to match the investment, a request that Justin Trudeau has said will be considered on the merits of \"the business case\" made by the Montreal-based aerospace and rail transportation company.\n\nA federal cash injection of $1 billion certainly would help stabilize the C-Series in the rollout phase of production. Bombardier is betting its future on getting orders for the C-Series, which is meant to position the company to compete in the mid-size passenger jet market against Boeing, Airbus and Embraer, formidable American, European and Brazilian aerospace players.\n\nAnd nothing is more important for the C-Series than a $2.1 billion order for 30 jets from Porter Airlines. Porter's hub is at Toronto's downtown Billy Bishop Airport. Which is where the wedge comes in.\n\nJets aren't allowed to land at the Toronto Island airport, and there's plenty of local opposition to the proposal to expand the runway on the Toronto waterfront to enable the C-Series to fly into Billy Bishop. Any change in the status quo requires the trilateral agreement of Toronto City Council, the Port of Toronto and the federal government.\n\nAnd the Liberal caucus for the Greater Toronto Area is opposed -- adamantly -- to jets landing at the island. Before the election, the GTA caucus wrote to Mayor John Tory and Toronto City Council affirming that \"we have pledged not to re-open the Tripartite Agreement\" excluding jets from serving Billy Bishop.\n\nSince the election, prominent Toronto MP Adam Vaughan, himself a former city councilor, has bluntly stated: \"No jets on the waterfront.\"\n\nThis was confirmed in a late-night tweet a week ago by Transport Minister Marc Garneau, who stated that the \"GoC position is the same as the LPC commitment, we will not re-open the tripartite agreement at YTZ (Billy Bishop).\"\n\nOnly hours earlier, scrumming in the lobby of the House, Garneau skillfully sidestepped the question, saying the government was considering all aspects of what he called \"a complex issue.\"\n\nAnd so here's the dilemma for Trudeau: How can he, on the one hand, invest $1 billion in the C-Series, while on the other killing the $2 billion Porter order by enforcing the ban at the Island Airport?\n\nThere was nothing complex about Garneau's tweet. CTV Toronto reported it might have been \"the final nail in the coffin\" for the C-Series. The Globe and Mail online ran this headline: \"Garneau says the government has no intention of letting passenger jets fly out of the Toronto Islands.\" The Toronto Star reported last weekend that \"a potential $2.1-billion sale of the planes to Porter Airlines fell through on Friday because it was conditioned on growth at Toronto's downtown airport, which has now been blocked.\"\n\nThere was consternation, to say the least, in Bombardier's executive offices in Montreal; they heard this news not from the government, but from Twitter. Many senior Bombardier executives, including members of the Beaudoin family, are Garneau's own constituents in his riding of NDG-Westmount. As a former president of the Canadian Space Agency in Montreal, Garneau knows better than anyone the importance of the aerospace industry to the local economy. It isn't just that thousands of high-paying manufacturing jobs depend on Bombardier; there's also great pride in the company as a global player. How many world champions does Canada have?\n\nThis is equally true on the rail side. The Quebec pension plan, the Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t, announced Thursday a $1.5 billion investment in a 30 per cent stake in Bombardier Transportation, a global player in the train, subway and streetcar space (Toronto is one of its showcase cities, and many of those cars are built in Thunder Bay.) As Caisse President Michael Sabia noted, the whole world is investing in urban transport infrastructure.\n\nGarneau and the prime minister are both Montreal ministers, and both understand the importance of the Bombardier file to the city and Quebec.\n\nBut Bombardier is also, in a way that isn't always appreciated, a player in the Ontario economy. The 400-series turbo prop, the heart of the Porter and Air Canada Express fleets, is manufactured in Toronto at Bombardier's Downsview plant. And a Bombardier corporate brochure notes the C-Series alone has 10 Ontario-based suppliers. As for local concerns about the noise from the jet, it has tested as the quietest in its class.\n\nOf course, you can always count on some people in Ontario and the West to complain about corporate welfare for Bombardier. But there's an intellectual double-standard at work here.\n\nNo voices were raised against Ottawa's $10 billion bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in 2009. Without that money, as then-Finance Minister Jim Flaherty confided at the time, \"GM and Chrysler would have left the country.\"\n\nAnd so here's the dilemma for Trudeau as he considers \"the business case\" for the C-Series from his own side of the table.\n\nHow can he, on the one hand, invest $1 billion in the C-Series, while on the other killing the $2 billion Porter order by enforcing the ban at the Island Airport?\n\nThere's a possible Canadian compromise on the horizon. While Billy Bishop is Porter's hub, the new express train from nearby Union Station could take connecting passengers to Pearson Airport in just 24 minutes. Air Canada might not like it, but it would solve the problem.\n\nAnd not just Bombardier's problem, but Trudeau's as well.\n\nL.

The status of Feature Country has clearly given a deeper dimension to the relationship between our two industries which we are looking forward to grow further,\" said Mr Vincent Gorry, Director, European and International Affairs, GIFAS.\n\nThe Philippines also made event history by participating as a country pavilion for the first time at the Singapore Airshow, and commemorated its debut by announcing deals with Airbus, Harris Corporation and Rolls-Royce.\n\n\"We first visited the show with our official delegates two years ago and saw that there would be potential. This year, we felt that we are ready to introduce ourselves and offer our interest in partnerships with many of the aerospace companies, said Glenn Penaranda, Commercial Counsellor, Philippine Trade & Investment Centre, Embassy of the Philippines. \"We are heartened to hear that people are looking forward to what the Philippines has to offer and have had very positive meetings with major players and even potential partners in this industry.\"\n\nChanging Nature of Business Deals\n\nA total of 50 deals were made at Singapore Airshow 2016, representing an increase of 14% over 2014. These included 10 deals with a total value of US$12.3 billion, as well as 40 deals with undisclosed values announced by 20 companies. In line with changing business trends, and as the industry becomes more sophisticated and competitive, a growing proportion of the announcements and deals included undisclosed values. More deals were announced by LCCs and aircraft leasing companies compared to 2014. In addition, eight MOU signings were made compared to four in 2014 as industry stakeholders look to build future capabilities.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nSingapore Airshow 2016 saw close to 10% increase in trade visitors, as well as a nearly 5% increase in the number of VIP delegations. There was also an increase in the number of local companies exhibiting in the Singapore Pavilion, with 36 companies taking part this year, compared to 29 companies in 2014.\n\nEmerging Opportunities\n\nThe wide array of opportunities at the Airshow spanned the commercial, defence, MRO, R&D and even manufacturing sectors. These opportunities not only emerged within industry sectors, but also from Asian countries and markets that displayed significant potential and were key focal areas for exhibitors and visitors. Industry heavyweights like GE Aviation announced new investments in new MRO facilities in Singapore, which includes establishing a new advanced technologies centre for R&D on repair applications, while Pratt & Whitney opened its first Singapore manufacturing facility on Monday, the only facility outside of the US to manufacture components for the company's latest engine, the PurePower(R) engine.\n\nAmong the growing spectrum of MRO opportunities are the agreement signed by Airbus and SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) to form a joint venture based in Singapore. The joint venture company will provide airframe maintenance, cabin upgrade and modification services for Airbus A380, A350 and A330 aircraft to airlines in the Asia Pacific and beyond, and marks SIAEC's first collaboration with a major aircraft manufacturer for airframe maintenance.\n\nSingapore Airlines also appointed key suppliers for its fleet of Airbus A350 aircraft including Thales to provide the in-flight entertainment system and Ka-band connectivity, and 12-year deals with Moog for maintenance and inventory support of the OEM's flight control products, and with UTC Aerospace Systems to supply asset management and repair services for the A350s.\n\nCreating Opportunities for Future Generations\n\nThe inaugural Singapore Airshow Aero Campus (SAAC) was held on 18 and 19 February, which saw close to 3,000 secondary school and tertiary students, full time national servicemen and young working professionals visiting the show. A new initiative designed to foster deeper interest and provide insights about the industry, from exploring higher education to embarking on rewarding careers in the aviation field, the SAAC showcased the wide range of education and career development opportunities that are available in the aviation and aerospace sector in Singapore. Attendees had the opportunity to tour the exhibition and static aircraft display, watch the aerial display performances, and also participated in workshops where they gained valuable industry insights by speaking to exhibiting companies and educational institutions.\n\nEmerging Dialogues\n\nThe Singapore Airshow offers a unique platform for thought leadership through its high-level conferences, forums, and co-located events, helping to shape the future agenda of the industry. The Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit (SAALS) 2016 brought together some 300 key stakeholders in aviation, including top government representatives, civil aviation authorities and senior executives of airlines, airline operators, aircraft manufacturers as well as the heads of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to exchange valuable insights, network and strengthen the nexus between governments and the aviation industry.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) concluded a milestone Maintenance Implementation Procedures (MIP) agreement on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow. This agreement allows for reciprocal acceptance of safety oversight requirements, as well as the mutual recognition of procedures for the approval and monitoring of aircraft maintenance organisations.\n\nEmerging Technologies\n\nThe new Aerospace Emerging Technologies Zone and Emerging Technologies Business Forum were introduced at Singapore Airshow 2016, focusing on some of the key trends in aviation such as augmented reality and unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs). The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) also made significant announcements that focused on emerging technologies in the aviation space. CAAS signed an agreement with the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) to establish a joint laboratory to advance air traffic management (ATM) research and development (R&D), as well as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU with Airbus Helicopters to conduct Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Proof-of-Concept Trials, named the Skyways Project, in Singapore. An agreement was also signed by CAAS with air traffic surveillance system supplier Aireon LLC to obtain and use space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data for the Singapore flight information region (FIR).\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nAbout 70% of exhibitors have already made reservations to participate at the next Singapore Airshow, with GMF from Indonesia, UAC from Russia and SAAB from Sweden among the exhibitors looking to increase their presence at Singapore Airshow 2018.\n\n\"We are heartened by the continued support and show of confidence from exhibitors and visitors for the Singapore Airshow as the global platform to tap into emerging opportunities, engage in emerging dialogues, and showcase emerging technologies in the fast growing Asia Pacific market,\" said Mr Leck Chet Lam, Managing Director of Experia Events. \"We are committed to creating carefully curated programme elements and are looking forward to delivering a 2018 edition that will further contribute to growing industry capabilities.\"\n\nSingapore Airshow 2018 will be held from 6 to 11 February at Changi Exhibition Centre.\n\nAbout Singapore Airshow\n\nSingapore Airshow, a marketplace and networking powerhouse for the world's aviation community, is a must-attend event in the global aerospace and defence calendar.

It said on Friday that there were 51 deals in total this year, up from 44 in 2014; and there were more deals with undisclosed values - 41, compared to 24 in 2014.\n\nThe real star of the airshow has always been \"the big, headline-grabbing aircraft numbers\", which this year's airshow had fewer of, compared to in 2014, said Mr Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Director of Flightglobal.\n\nThis year's show saw only two 'billion-dollar' aircraft deals - one each to Airbus and Boeing, and several multi-million dollar deals for engines, maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services, and defence-related services.\n\nVisitors on the exhibition floor of the 2016 Singapore Airshow on the show's last trading day.

(Photo: Linette Lim)\n\nA TRIPLE WHAMMY\n\nMr Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said he had expected the 2016 airshow to be \"less successful\" than the previous edition.\n\nHe told Channel NewsAsia that this is due to a triple whammy - \"weaker sentiment due to a tepid global economy, over-spending on aircraft in recent years by airlines\" and weariness setting in with the Dubai Airshow having just concluded last November.\n\nAnother industry watcher - Mr Brendan Sobie, from the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) - suggested that one potential problem could be the Singapore Airshow's positioning relative to the other major airshows in Paris, Farnborough and Dubai.\n\nCompared to the other airshows which are \"more global\", the Singapore show \"typically only sees deals from airlines in Asia, particularly Southeast Asia\", and it is precisely the Southeast Asian carriers - like AirAsia, Lion Air, and VietJet - which have a diminished buying appetite now due to a \"huge surge in orders\" in recent years, said Mr Sobie, who is chief analyst at CAPA.\n\nHe added that what could have compounded the problem for the Singapore show is that the other airshows \"have the benefit of being later in the calendar year where there are generally more orders\".\n\nAl-Fursan aerobatics team of the United Arab Emirates Air Force performs at the Dubai Airshow.

I think it's because of the issues in the South China Sea, people are getting a little bit more concerned about maritime security,\" he said. He added that there was potential for regional governments - especially Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia - to boost capability in monitoring of their coastlines and maritime environment.\n\nThe biennial Singapore Airshow is Asia's largest airshow, and among the top three airshows in the world together with Paris and Farnborough. More than 1,000 companies, including more than 60 of the top 100 aerospace companies in the world, participated in this year's airshow.\n\nIts next edition is scheduled from Feb 6 to 11 in 2018, and Experia Events has said that potential areas of focus are on virtual and augmented reality, and the unique capabilities of Asian countries.", "SINGAPORE - Organizers of the Singapore Airshow said $12.3 billion in airplane deals were signed at the event this week, a sharp drop from the last show in 2014.\n\nLeck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, said Friday that this year's figure was comprised of 10 deals, with another 40 made at undisclosed values. There were 24 undisclosed deals in 2014.\n\nThe 2014 show generated $32 billion of sales. Organizers released this year's total which covers commercial, private and defense deals after the three-day trade period ended Friday.\n\nModest airplane orders for Boeing and Airbus announced earlier in the week hinted at a lull in demand, as overflowing order books at the manufacturers and a fall in oil prices spurred airlines to keep their older less fuel-efficient planes for longer.\n\n\"Many Asian airlines placed large orders between 2011 and 2014, and now have a long pipeline of aircraft deliveries to absorb over the next four years,\" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight.\n\n\"Future new orders are expected to come in smaller sizes (over the next two years), with most new Asia-Pacific airline orders likely to come in sizes of dozens of aircraft rather than the mammoth orders seen during the 2012 and 2014 Singapore Airshows.\"\n\nBut Biswas said the mood in the commercial aviation industry remains buoyant, with growth in air passenger numbers expected to remain robust.\n\nPassenger numbers in Asia are expected by Airbus to grow by 5.6 percent annually, with China forecast to post double digit growth.\n\nOn Friday, Boeing announced an order for four 737 MAX 8 airplanes, valued at $440 million at list prices from Air Niugini. On Wednesday, the manufacturer announced a deal for 12 of its 737 jets with a privately-owned Chinese carrier Okay Airways, valued at $1.3 billion.\n\nAirbus announced an order for six A350-900s, valued at $1.8 billion at list prices from Philippine Airlines.", "SINGAPORE: The value of deals at Asia's biggest airshow fell sharply as mammoth plane orders of the past thinned due to airline overcapacity and a global economic slowdown, organizers and analysts said Friday.\n\nDespite growth in Asia's passenger air traffic, seats remain in surplus with regional carriers continuing to take delivery of planes they had ordered during the past few years, analysts said, as the show's trade portion wrapped up in Singapore.

The absence of an improvement in debt metrics is likely to trigger a ratings downgrade by the December review - or even as soon as the June review - if the budget disappoints, said Packirisamy.\n\nShe shared the view of Herman van Papendorp, head of macro research and asset allocation at MMI, that bland growth expectations, characterised by lacklustre growth in domestic demand, tepid global trade activity, labour unrest and stuttering electricity supply, will likely put hurdles in government's ability to meet the tax revenue collection targets set in October 2015's mini budget.\n\nVan Papendorp and Packirisamy pointed out that current expenditure would have to be curtailed meaningfully to protect the expenditure ceiling, while limiting cutbacks to vital capital expenditure. Revenue-enhancing tax proposals would also have to be part of the mix to bring down the deficit in coming years.\n\nIn their opinion, a likely dent to tax revenues will require a higher tax burden and sizeable cutbacks on expenditure plans, including non-essential goods and services, capital expenditure and the contingency reserve.\n\nTax policy\n\nIn the national budget delivered in 2015, government reiterated that tax policy aims to raise revenue in a fair and efficient manner that supports long-term economic growth and job creation. To achieve this, it has attempted to broaden the tax base over the past two decades.\n\n\"In addition to the standard fuel, 'sin' taxes and bracket creep, additional revenue measures may have to be considered in the 2016 budget,\" warned Packirisamy.\n\n\"Although the backdrop of a slowing growth environment - particularly in a local government election year - challenges a decision to raise consumption taxes on a broader base rather than increase the tax burden on higher-income earners, Treasury may have little choice but to deliver on both in order to improve the fiscal trajectory and appease rating agencies.\"\n\nPresident Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation speech (SONA) addressed the economic threats facing SA and admitted to not acting quickly enough in the past. But government did not provide measurable targets for cost-cutting initiatives affecting non-core services. Packirisamy believed SONA outlined few tangible proposals to resolve regulatory barriers.\n\n\"In our view, little was said to increase faith in government's ability to accelerate anaemic domestic gross domestic product (GDP) projections, while simultaneously averting a sovereign debt downgrade to junk status over the next year.\"\n\nIt seems to them that the task of providing detailed plans on this has been left to the finance ministry during the delivery of the National Budget.\n\nSOE pressures\n\nIn response to pressure on government from business and rating agencies, Zuma has since released a report that recommends a shake-up of SA's state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including a partial listing of some and the privatisation of others.\n\nThe report recommends encouraging and expanding private sector participation through partnering with SOEs to deliver on economic and social infrastructure plans. In addition, an interministerial committee is currently investigating how to instill good corporate governance across SA's SOEs and prevent the practice of awarding contracts on the basis of political connections.\n\nThe vulnerable financial state of parastatals could prompt a further extension of Treasury's guarantees, preventing the stabilisation of the overall debt ratio - including guarantees, provisions and contingent liabilities - below the 60% South African Development Community (Sadc) target, warned Packirisamy.\n\nTreasury's February 2015 projections estimated overall debt reaching 58.1% of GDP by the financial year 2015/2016, with contingent liabilities accounting for R485bn - close to a fifth of the total value of debt projected at R2.4trn.\n\nSAA racks up a R29bn bailout\n\nPackirisamy pointed out that South African Airways (SAA) has been a key risk in the SOE space, racking up close to R29bn in bailout funds, loan guarantees and convertible loans since the financial year 2004/2005.\n\n\"Although Treasury avoided making pre-delivery payments to Airbus - which would have amounted to R603m - and have instead finalised a swap deal, all eyes will remain on the appointment of a new permanent SAA board to stabilise the airline,\" said Packirisamy.\n\n\"Improving cooperation between public and private sectors in infrastructure development should be viewed positively, but more concrete measures will need to be announced in the budget to prevent growth in investment from stagnating.\"\n\nFitch downgraded both SA's local and foreign currency debt by one notch in December 2015, while also attaching a neutral outlook to the ratings. S&P affirmed both its ratings in December, but revised the outlooks to negative. Moody's also dropped its outlook on SA's debt to negative in December 2015.\n\nPackirisamy pointed out that since then, the growth outlook has deteriorated further, putting more pressure on fiscal and debt metrics, particularly relative to the BBB-ratings peer group. Additionally, mounting debt risks associating with contingent liabilities and escalating debt servicing costs - as a share of government revenues - lowers SA's fiscal flexibility.\n\n\"One of the historical cornerstones of SA's investment-grade rating has been its highly-regarded institutional framework, including the Treasury and the SA Reserve Bank. Nenegate has introduced worries that these institutions are no longer deemed untouchable by politicians and could be less independent institutions than previously perceived,\" concluded Packirisamy.", "AFP - The value of deals at Asia's biggest airshow fell sharply as mammoth plane orders of the past thinned due to airline overcapacity and a global economic slowdown, organisers and analysts said Friday.\n\nDespite growth in Asia's passenger air traffic, seats remain in surplus with regional carriers continuing to take delivery of planes they had ordered during the past few years, analysts said, as the show's trade portion wrapped up in Singapore.

United Technologies and Honeywell declined to comment on the report. Pentagon officials had no immediate comment.\n\nJeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said any combination would spark a serious antitrust review given overlapping business in areas ranging from engines to avionics.\n\n\"If this were to go forward, it would get significant U.S. government scrutiny,\" said Bialos. \"This kind of a deal could well result in some kind of material divestiture.\"\n\nThe sources said the government was unlikely to approve a merger of this scale in a presidential election year, which meant the process could likely drag on for 18 to 24 months.\n\nSome analysts and antitrust experts said the deal could ultimately be approved if the parties agreed to some big divestitures, since there are other competitors, and if they enlisted the backing of their biggest customers.\n\n\"We think a merger would unlock significant synergies,\" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Jim Corridore in a note to clients.\n\nPeter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said that the deal would likely win antitrust approval unless there was \"a very substantial expression of concern by the airplane manufacturers.\"\n\nShares of United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, closed up 4.6 percent Monday. Shares of Honeywell, a maker of aerospace parts and climate control systems, fell 2 percent.\n\nUnited Technologies and Honeywell first began exploring a merger as early as 1993, but the talks were revived after a broad strategic review initiated by United Tech's Chief Executive Greg Hayes when he took over last year, according to the sources. That review also resulted in United Technologies selling Sikorsky Aircraft to Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\nHayes put out feelers with Honeywell, but he was snubbed, the people said. In September, after United Technologies' market capitalisation dropped due to poor earnings, Honeywell approached United Technologies with its own offer, which would see it lead the merger instead, the people added.\n\nDespite United Technologies having been offered a premium for its shares, the deal was seen by the company as \"dead in the water\" with U.S. antitrust officials due to overlapping business in the commercial aerospace and military markets, the people added.\n\nUnited Technologies grew sceptical of the deal's prospects with antitrust regulators after reviewing it more closely over the course of the last year, one source close to the company said.\n\nUnited Technologies, which like many multinationals has been hurt by a strong dollar, unveiled a $1.5-billion restructuring plan to cut costs in December, citing slowing growth in China and weakness in Latin America and Europe.\n\nHoneywell, which counts Boeing and Bombardier Inc among its customers, has cut jobs and sold or merged businesses to reduce costs.\n\nBoth companies have been under pressure by Boeing and Airbus to reduce their costs, and both have also seen defence orders squeezed in recent years.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ankit Ajmera and Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru, Euan Rocha in Toronto, and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Bill Rigby and Bernard Orr and Nick Zieminski)\n\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.", "WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.N. panel approved on Monday a temporary ban on cargo shipments of rechargeable lithium batteries on passenger planes because they are can create intense fires capable of destroying an aircraft.\n\nThe decision by the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization's top-level governing council isn't binding, but most countries follow the agency's standards.

This configuration is meant to hold two professional wrestlers and give them plenty of breathing room.\n\nAnother drawing shows how the central armrest folds up and two smaller armrests lower to hold three people on the bench. Yet another option makes room for two adults and two kids. The seat belts can also be arranged to accommodate the different number of passengers.\n\nThis isn't the first unusual airline seating patent application we've come across.

ICAO has no direct power to craft or enforce regulations but facilitates negotiations over standards that become mandatory for the agency's 190 member countries.\n\nThe stakes are high. A 2012 ICAO paper predicted that international aviation emissions would increase 68 per cent between 2010 and 2020, from 390 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to 654 megatonnes.\n\nProjections for how much the ICAO rules will lower carbon emissions vary widely. The White House estimates they would reduce as much as 650 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2020 and 2040 - or the equivalent of taking 140 million cars off the road during the same period.\n\nEnvironmental advocates argued the new standards will do little to lower emissions, especially with air traffic expected to double over 15 years, according to ICAO projections. ICAO did not make any public estimate of carbon emissions that the new standards would eliminate.\n\nThe rules merely ratified what manufacturers were already doing, said Daniel Rutherford, an aviation specialist for the International Council on Clean Transportation, a non-profit group that closely followed the ICAO talks.\n\n\"ICAO has recommended targets that new models will easily pass and that won't require improvements from older, less efficient models until well after they'll be out of production anyway,\" he said.\n\nNegotiators are not permitted to talk to the media under ICAO rules governing the talks, but three officials with knowledge of the talks spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.\n\nConcerns about industry and economic impact drove the compromise, according to US and European officials. More stringent standards could have cost the industry huge amounts of money. A single new engine, for instance, can cost billions of dollars to design and certify. \"The negotiation was not completely detached from commercial considerations,\" a European diplomatic source acknowledged.\n\nUS negotiators met resistance on pushing for a quicker phase-out of less efficient planes, according to an American official familiar with the talks. \"There was definitely a high bar to getting agreement on a 2023 production cutoff,\" the US official said.\n\nSupporters of the new rules say they will ensure that companies continue building on efficiencies gained in plane makers' latest generation of jets, such as the Boeing 737 MAX and the A320neo. \"This is the same conversation we have on all standards,\" said one negotiator involved in the talks.\n\n\"What is the balance between pushing industry along without breaking industry by pushing them too far?\"\n\nBoeing spokesperson Jessica Kowal said the company supports the ICAO standard \"because it is ambitious in terms of CO2 emissions reduction, it is aligned with customer needs for increasing fuel efficiency, and it is technologically achievable in an industry with a long lead time\".\n\nA spokesperson said on Thursday that Airbus supports the new standards and continues to invest in \"reducing fuel burn, emissions and noise significantly.\" Both companies declined to comment on efforts they may have made to advocate for a specific outcome in the talks, which included negotiators from 22 nations.\n\nAirbus, Boeing and their engine manufacturers have invested tens of billions of dollars in new technology to save fuel, which also cuts carbon emissions. Such efforts accelerated during a decade of relatively high oil prices.\n\nNow, with a regulatory framework in place, standards can be more easily tightened in future, said Paul Steele, environment director at the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines.\n\nThe clashes over standards for aircraft manufacturers are seen as a rehearsal for a broader fight over how global airlines may be required to contribute to greenhouse gas reductions. That debate continues this week with more high-level talks in Montreal.\n\nNegotiations among transportation policy makers from 17 countries will focus on \"market-based\" regulatory regimes, with industry pushing a plan that would allow airlines to offset their emissions by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the globe.

That also is followed by the highest stakes regarding regulatory concerns. So what are investors and consumers expected to think when they hear that United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) and Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) may be in (or held) merger talks?\n\nTalks were reportedly initiated by United Tech, according to CNBC's David Faber. While there are other operations to consider, the reality is that this would make for yet another aerospace giant which could come with the creation of a company with over $90 billion in annual sales.\n\n24/7 Wall St. has no interest in simply carrying out a rebroadcast of this market rumor. What matters here is the regulatory angle. When you ask about whether or not regulators would approve such a deal, there is the past consideration of General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) wanting to acquire Honeywell. This was not blocked by U.S. regulators, but the GE-Honeywell merger was blocked by European Union regulatory powers.\n\nAnd then there is the case of Staples, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLS). This $6 billion company by market cap is trying to win approval for the acquisition of Office Depot, Inc. (NASDAQ: ODP). US regulators age currently against this merger, and the value of Office Depot, even after its acquisition of OfficeMax, is just $2.9 billion. European regulators have granted what appears to be approval, but Staples has agreed to sell off certain operations. Staples has also offered concessions here in the United States as well. This deal remains under legal challenge by the U.S. regulators.\n\nCNBC's David Faber said that Honeywell offered a premium deal in stock and cash for United Tech. On top of risks from U.S. regulators, there is also a concern that the likes of Boeing and Airbus might oppose the creation of a single entity that supplies so many individual jet components and parts.\n\nALSO READ: Why Warren Buffett Bought Kinder Morgan Over Other Infrastructure and MLPs\n\nFaber noted that discussions may have started as long as a year ago. At that point, it was not known that the Staples-Office Depot merger would be blocked.\n\nWhat is interesting now is that Honeywell shares have outperformed United Tech. Honeywell is now worth $82 billion in market cap and United Technologies is worth $78 billion, but United Tech's value is after a gain of more than 5% after Faber broke the news.\n\nRegulators do not necessarily just judge a merger based upon size alone. They look toward the combined power on competition within the business space(s) they operate in. Needless to say, having close to $100 billion in annual sales on a combined basis would be enough to raise eyebrows at the regulatory level.\n\nMergers used to simply be rubber-stamped for approval. The GE/Honeywell deal was a massive disappointment in the world of M&A, and that was back in 2001. It might seem silly to think that a merger blockage 15 years ago would matter today, but you have to consider that the revenue base would be greater today and we are inside a more difficult regulatory climate towards approving mergers.\n\nIt needs to at least be considered that United Tech was trumped by GE in the effort to acquire Honeywell way back when. Honeywell revenue was $25 billion or so back then, and is closer to $40 billion now. United Tech's revenue in 2015 was $56 billion. In November 2015, Lockheed Martin completed a $9 billion acquisition of Sikorsky - from United Tech.\n\nIf the U.S wants to block a big merger, this seems like it might be an issue. Whether or not European regulators would care remains to be seen, but we cannot ignore, even if they were under different leadership then, that the Europeans did ultimately block a GE-Honeywell merger. And now we have to keep in mind that U.S. regulators are formally against the Staples and Office Depot deal as of now.\n\nALSO READ: 4 Super-Safe Defensive Dividend Stocks Now Valued at Massive Premiums\n\nShares of United Technologies were last seen up 6% at $93.48 and Honeywell shares were last seen down 1.4% at $105.77.

Discussions occurred earlier this month in which Honeywell would offer mostly stock for its smaller rival, the report said.\n\nThere is no assurance that these talks will result in a deal, and some involved in the negotiations on the United Technologies side have expressed concerns that the merger could face antitrust issues. The deal would be larger than the $68.6 billion proposal between American industrial giants DuPont and Dow Chemical, floated earlier this year.\n\nThe two companies make many of the systems that go into commercial and defense aircraft and would likely face opposition from Boeing and Airbus. Honeywell and United Technologies have been in talks off and on for much of the past year, but obstacles over which company would be in control of the merged entity has stymied progress. In 2000, United Technologies was outbid by General Electric in a takeover attempt, but European antitrust regulators blocked the transaction.\n\nUnited Technologies Corporation (UTX) | FindTheCompany\n\nIn October, United Technologies turned down Honeywell's efforts to offer its shareholders as light premium to support the merger.

As a result, seats and personal space are shrinking. People, meanwhile, are getting larger.\n\nWith the federal standard for airplane seat width still set based on measurements taken in 1962, many flyers struggle to comfortably fit into airplane seats.\n\nNow Airbus has come up with a potential solution to this problem.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application from Airbus' Sven Taubert and Florian Schmidt for a \"re-configurable passenger bench seat.\"\n\nThe system, which could be adapted for other modes of transportation, features a bench seat that can be configured to hold anywhere from two passengers to a whole family.\n\nThe magic behind the Airbus seat lies with a system of adjustable and armrest placements. As a result, an airline can tailor the amount of space available to a particular passenger, based on the amount required.\n\n\u00a9 Airbus Airbus bench seat patent\n\nThe Airbus seat could ultimately revolutionize the way airlines sell tickets. Instead of the current \u00e1 la cart system, which spreads costs evenly within a class of seats, the new system would allow airlines to index pricing to the amount of space and fuel required to transport a passenger.

And yet the watchmaker Richard Mille, whose Swiss brand is best known for fashioning avant-garde timepieces from space-age materials, found enough similarities between the two worlds to co-design a watch with Airbus Corporate Jets, or ACJ.\n\nAs the ACJ managing director, Benoit Defforge, put it: \"We have the same kind of customer.\"\n\nThe result of their two-year collaboration, introduced at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva in January, is the 30-piece limited edition RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph, available exclusively at Richard Mille boutiques for a staggering $1.05 million.\n\nThe relationship between the two brands, neither of which had ever engaged in a partnership of this nature, began after a friend of Mr. Mille's put him in touch with Mr. Defforge. For the French watchmaker, teaming with the aircraft manufacturer based in Toulouse, France, was something of a fantasy. \"I'm totally mad about Airbus,\" he said. \"I've been a hundred times around the globe. Still, when I see their aircraft I am like a baby.\"\n\nThe challenge was \"to identify the parts of the plane that you could bring to a watch,\" Mr. Defforge said. \"We wanted to give the feeling that this watch is an Airbus Corporate Jet, not a watch with Airbus Corporate Jets written on it.\"\n\nSylvain Mariat, head of ACJ's corporate design studio, took the first stab at creating a lightweight skeletonized model. He constructed a case from a titanium-aluminum alloy, the same material Airbus uses for jet turbine blades, added a ceramic bezel shaped like an airplane window, and then replaced Richard Mille's signature screws with Torq-Set screws used by Airbus.\n\nMr. Mariat, working in concert with Julien Boillat and Salvador Arbona at Richard Mille, translated the massive structures used to attach wings to the aircraft engine into pushers on the sides of the watch and finished the timepiece with a jet engine-inspired crown marked with the Airbus logo.\n\nThe complex split-seconds chronograph movement inside the case boasts numerous concessions to energy efficiency: The titanium reduces internal friction, and several of its bridges have been treated with an aeronautical coating used to protect engine and chassis parts from corrosion.\n\nBeyond promoting the timepiece at aviation industry events, such as the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition in Geneva in May, Mr. Defforge said Airbus would let Mr. Mille handle distribution and sales. And even though the luxury watch industry is facing a tough economic environment this year, Mr. Mille does not appear concerned by the prospect of selling 30 million-dollar timepieces.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel guilty, because 2015 has been incredible for us,\" he said, speaking from a health clinic in Germany, where he was on a 15-day fast with his American business partner and distributor, John Simonian. \"Every day we have soup at lunch, every night he is pushing me for deliveries.\"", "Obese passengers could be given more room on planes if rows of benches instead of individual seats are introduced by airlines.\n\nThis appears to be the plans of Airbus after the aircraft manufacturer filed a patent for bench seating in planes that can be adjusted to fit the space needs of the passengers, whether it's for families with small children, customers with mobility issues or men or women who require more width than others.\n\nThe \"re-configurable passenger bench seat\" could put an end to the debates and disputes revolving around the varying circumference of fliers. Just last year, a man on an Etihad Airways flight sued the airline, accusing it of forcing him to contort his body for long periods because of the \"grossly overweight\" person in the next seat.\n\nThere have also been numerous calls for larger passengers to pay for extra seat space, with Samoa Air introducing a passenger charge by wait, rather than per seat, in 2013. The same airline then unveiled a new \"XL class\" to cater for larger customers, creating a wider row for passengers weighing more than 286 pounds (130kg).\n\nAirbus does not outline how the exact pricing for a bench space might work, but says \"in modern means of transport, particularly in aircraft, optimum utilisation of the space available in a passenger cabin is of major economic importance\".\n\nThe patent, filed last year but published this month, read: \"The cabin layout, particularly the layout of the passenger seats arranged in the passenger cabin, such as the allocation of a row of passenger seats to business class or to economy class for example, should be as flexibly, rapidly and easily re-configurable as possible.\n\nAirbus's patent is the latest in a number of ambitious plans to transform the way we fly.\n\nA Zodiac Aerospace patent in December imagined how passengers might be better accommodated in the hold - with tv screens playing images from the outside, rather than actual windows.\n\nWhile an Airbus design from October considered introducing a mezzanine level in planes so that passengers could sit above their fellow fliers.\n\nAnother Zodiac design from 2015 had passengers facing each other, in alternating backwards and forwards seats to increase a plane's seating capacity.\n\nAs with any patents, however, there's no guarantee flight benches will be on any of your trips in the near future. But there just might come a time when it's not only your hand luggage that is measured before boarding.", "Already a subscriber, but don't have a login?\n\nActivate your digital access.\n\nBoeing Co. is finally open for business in Iran.

Kennedy International and Bostons Logan International airports. Launch fares for the new routes start sales today from just $ 799 USD (tax included), for roundtrip travel.\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e0e42a7c-c142-44cd-bb44-60e8ea5bcb3b\n\nThe new daily Boston service starts on June 11 and the new JFK daily flights commence on July 1. Both will be operated with new Airbus A330 aircraft to be delivered in June. In addition, TAP also serves Lisbon from Miami and from Newark. These routes will grow to daily service this summer, and TAP also serves Oporto twice weekly from Newark. Altogether, TAPs US service will grow to 30 flights per week.\n\nFlights will depart JFK at 23:30, arriving at Lisbon at 11:30 (next day). Returning flights leave Lisbon at 17:00, arriving at JFK at 20:00. From Boston, flights will depart at 19:45, arriving at Lisbon at 07:20 (next day). Returning flights leave Lisbon at 14:25, arriving at Boston at 17:00.\n\nI congratulate TAP Portugal and welcome their return to JFK, where we recently announced record-breaking passenger numbers for 2015, including 30 million international air travelers, Port Authority Aviation Director Thomas L. Bosco said. I wish our friends at TAP Portugal, whove been such great partners at Newark Liberty International Airport, the same success on the launch of their Lisbon service at JFK the premier international gateway to the United States.\n\nIt is only fitting that Portugals oldest airline now led by David Neeleman, an aviation innovator, would want to fly daily between Lisbon and Boston, said Massport CEO Thomas P. Glynn. Massachusetts is known for its innovation and it has the highest percentage of residents of Portuguese descent of any state.\n\nIts really exciting to expand TAPs international service now to four U.S. gateway cities, thus offering North American travelers easy and convenient flights to Lisbon, Europes first gateway, as well as connectivity to further destinations beyond, said Fernando Pinto, TAPs Chief Executive Officer.\n\nBeyond the additional flights, which is important, its exciting that TAP is also adding new aircraft with a new cabin configuration for a much improved customer experience, said David Neeleman, CEO of DGN Corp, partner in Atlantic Gateway, shareholders in TAP. Of course, on a personal level, its wonderful to be back at JFK and Logan and working with JetBlue again to provide easy connections from cities around the U.S. to Lisbon.\n\nDavid Neeleman was joined at JFKs Terminal 5 today by Scott Laurence, JetBlues Senior Vice President Airline Planning, to unveil the two airlines new partnership agreement. JetBlue flights from more than 20 U.S. cities will feed the JFK, Boston and Newark routes with convenient connecting flights. TAP will operate from JetBlues Terminal 5 at JFK and Terminal C at Logan.\n\nJetBlue is proud to help fueling the ongoing growth of international air carrier service to Boston and New York and are excited to welcome TAP into our homes in both cities, said Robin Hayes, JetBlues president and CEO. As our 45 airline partner, TAP customers will benefit from seamless access to the JetBlue network with reduced connecting times in our state-of-the-art airport facilities. And JetBlue customers will benefit from an expanded list of international nonstop destinations from our two northeast focus cities.\n\nTAP plans to promote Portugal vigorously as a vibrant and exciting tourism destination, and Lisbon as a prime gateway into Europe for North American travelers. The airline is launching a promotional campaign and other initiatives to promote Portugal in the U.S. and provide American travelers with an incentive program encouraging them to choose Lisbon as the preferred stopover when flying to or from Europe.\n\nIn order to prompt its expansion in the USA, TAP is taking delivery of two additional Airbus A330s, its long-haul fleet increasing thus to 20 aircraft. TAPs new Executive Class cabin boasts 20 lie-flat seats from Stelia Solstys, plus new slim-line Zim EC01 seats in other cabins, now with a 34 seat pitch in Economy Plus and a 31 pitch in Economy. Passengers also will enjoy the most advanced audio and visual systems using the most up-to-date Panasonic EX-3 in-flight individual on-demand entertainment system.\n\nAfter being completely renovated and retrofitted with all new seats, lighting and entertainment systems as well as new galleys lavatories, these aircraft are consistent with the most recent generation of aircraft in the world in their class. With seat capacity for 271 passengers 20 in Executive Class, 104 in Economy Plus and 147 in Economy the A330 aircraft are leading the way with the new configuration into which the entire TAP fleet of A330-200s is to be retrofitted from 2017 onward.\n\nAdditionally, TAP recently announced an order for 53 new Airbus aircraft; 60 million for the cabin retrofit of TAP current fleet; 11 million to retrofit 12 A320-family aircraft with sharklet devices and the complete renewal of the regional fleet that will operate at TAP Express.\n\nTAP is Portugals leading airline, and member of Star Alliance, the global airline alliance to offer customers worldwide reach, since 2005. In operation since 1945, TAP celebrated 70 years on March 14, 2015, and has completed its privatization process in 2015, with the Atlantic Gateway Group now as new private shareholders of its share capital. TAP's hub in Lisbon is a key European gateway at the crossroads of Africa, North, Central and South America, where TAP stands out as the international leading carrier in operation to Brazil. The companys network currently comprises 81 destinations in 34 countries worldwide. TAP currently operates about 2,500 weekly flights in average on a modern fleet of 61 Airbus aircraft and 16 aircraft operating in PGA colours, and with TAP's regional carrier, adding up to a 77 aircraft fleet in the whole. Within the vast restructure program currently going across the company as the outcome of its privatization process, TAP has already announced its Network restructure, its medium and long haul fleet renewal program as of 2017 and the retrofit of the fleet currently in operation as well as the launch of the new branded product TAP Express, which will soon replace PGA and operate a new fleet of 8 ATR 72 and 9 Embraer 190. In the pursuit of its customer focused policy, TAP continuously strives to deliver safe, reliable and upgraded products & services, tailored to meet customers expectations. Retaining the Portuguese character of the Companys brand and quality service as the basic concept has been the main driver of TAP's strategy in most recent years. Recognized and awarded as the Europes Leading Airline to Africa as well as Europes Leading Airline to South America by the World Travel Awards in 2015 and 2014, the company was also awarded as the WTA Worlds Leading Airline to Africa in 2011 and 2012 and the WTA Worlds Leading Airline to South America in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Voted Best Airline in Europe in 2011, 2012, 2013 and again in 2015 by the Global Traveler, USA, the company was also honored by UNESCO and by the International Union of Geological Sciences with the IYPE Planet Earth Award 2010, in the category of Most Innovative Sustainable Product.

The patent, which was filed in August and published this month, explained that the bench-style seating arrangement could be used to help accommodate families, seniors and people with restricted mobility.\n\nWhile the patent filing points towards a demand for airlines to comfortably accommodate passengers of all shapes and sizes, the drawings that come with this particular patent are stirring up some giggles online.\n\nConsumerist described the renderings as \"slightly disconcerting,\" noting that the passengers appear to be wearing unitards. Mashable added, \"the tiny people in these drawings might haunt our dreams.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time an Airbus patent has raised some eyebrows.\n\nIn October, a patent application from the manufacturer showed passengers seated on top of each other in a bi-level configuration. In other words, you would be stacked on top of your seat mate.\n\nAccording to the application, the standard aircraft cabin design will feature two levels of passengers with a \"mezzanine seating area\" that would replace the overhead lockers.\n\nAirbus claims the design would \"provide a high level of comfort for the passengers\" -- but the concept drawings paint a different image.\n\nA patent application doesn't mean Airbus is actually building new seating arrangements.", "Boeing wins contract with Air Niugini for four new 737 Max 8 aircraft aimed to link PNG to the world\n\nUS Aircraft maker Boeing said Friday it had won a K1.36 billion (US$440 million) deal with PNG flag carrier Air Niugini for four 737 Max 8 planes, according to international aviation industry news.\n\nAnnouncing the deal along with Boeing at the final trade day of the Singapore Air show, Air Niugini chairman Sir Frederick Reiher said the carrier needed the planes \"urgently\", in reports from international Aviation Industry news.\n\n\"Papua New Guinea is like no other place on earth and the 737 Max will allow us to economically and efficiently connect our beautiful country with the rest of the world. The superb economics of the 737 Max will enable us to increase flight frequencies and develop into new markets which offer significant opportunities for Air Niugini,\" Sir Frederick said.\n\n\"As our region continues to grow, the 737 Max is the perfect choice for Air Niugini positioning us for success and ensuring we continue to provide our customers with the best experience possible. We look forward to receiving our first airplanes in 2020.\"\n\nThe previously unidentified order adds to the national carrier's fleet of Next-Generation 737's and 767-300ERs (extended range) airplanes.\n\n\"We are honored to expand our current partnership with Air Niugini with the addition of four 737 Max 8 airplanes' said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president, Asia Pacific and India Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\n\"The 737 Max will provide Air Niugini with the fuel efficiency, operating economics and passenger amenities they need to ensure their success for the future.\n\nThe 737 Max incorporates the latest technology CFM international LEAP-1B engines.\n\nAdvanced technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single aisle market.\n\nThe new single aisle airplane will deliver 20 per cent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation 737's and the lowest operating costs in its class- 8 per cent per seat less than its nearest competitor.\n\nAir Nigini operates a robust domestic network of more than 25 destinations from Port Moresby hub as wll as numerous international routes across Asia Pacific including Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, Fiji, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Hong Kong, Vanuatu, Japan and in the near future China.\n\nDinesh Keskar, regional senior vice president for sales at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the aircraft had its first test flight in late January and was performing exceptionally well.\n\nBoeing 737 aircraft family competes with European rival Airbus a320 series in the single-aisle market where the planes are favoured for short to medium-haul routes because of their fuel efficiency.\n\nThe Singapore Show, considered the biggest in Asia and held every two years, has seen markedly fewer orders for aircraft this time around amid a global economic slowdown led by China that has impacted travel demand.\n\nSOURCE: POST COURIER/PACNEWS", "Flag carrier Philippine Airlines is poised to strengthen its position in the United States with the acquisition of new long-haul aircraft, aviation consultancy firm CAPA-Center for Aviation said in a report.\n\nCAPA outlined strategies PAL may pursue after the carrier announced last week that it would buy six Airbus A350-900 planes in a deal that carries an option to acquire six more.\n\nIts first A350 will be delivered in 2018 and will add to PAL's existing long-haul fleet of Boeing 777-300 ERs, Airbus A340s and Airbus A330-300s.\n\nPAL, which plans to retire its aging A340s with the delivery of A350 planes, is in a good position to capture a bigger slice of the US market, CAPA said.\n\nExpansion in the United States has resumed since the Philippines' category 1 safety status was restored by the US Federal Aviation Administration in 2014.\n\nUsing more efficient planes to ply these routes is the next step, CAPA said.\n\nUS routes are being served using PAL's B777s and A340s.\n\nThe A350 will allow the carrier to mount non-stop flights between Manila and New York in 2018.\n\n\"PAL's load factor to the US is generally high, an indication that the market can support an increase in capacity. Its average load factor to Los Angeles and San Francisco is generally above 80 percent most of the year, and in peak months is often above 90 percent,\" CAPA said.\n\n\"The Philippines-US market will likely grow at least modestly over the next several years. PAL should also be able to increase its Philippine US market share as it adds nonstop capacity,\" it added.\n\nPAL already has between 6,500 and almost 9,000 non-stops seats to the US during the year, through Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nIt will launch flights between Cebu and Los Angeles next month, which will add 10 percent more seats, CAPA said.\n\nCAPA noted that the A350 also makes it attractive for PAL to launch a new route in Europe, but it said the flag carrier was better off expanding in the US as this would provide \"better returns\" due to limited competition from Gulf carriers.\n\nBigger planes like the A350 also provide other benefits due to slot limitations in Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport.\n\n\"The A350-900 is another example of upgauging as PAL phases out smaller A340-300s. PAL can continue to grow its long haul operation at Manila by upgauging aircraft and redeploying slots now used for short haul flights,\" CAPA said.\n\nWith the decision on long-haul planes settled, CAPA said PAL can turn its attention to \"renewing and expanding\" its regional aircraft fleet, which consists of older nine Bomardier Dash 8 turboprops.\n\nNew turboprop planes will be needed by PAL as not all airports in the country can handle larger aircraft, CAPA said.", "Airbus\n\nIn a bid to maximize profits, airlines are squeezing more and more people onto their planes. As a result, seats and personal space are shrinking. People, meanwhile, are getting larger.\n\nWith the federal standard for airplane seat width still set based on measurements taken in 1962, many flyers struggle to comfortably fit into airplane seats.\n\nNow Airbus has come up with a potential solution to this problem.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application from Airbus' Sven Taubert and Florian Schmidt for a \"re-configurable passenger bench seat.\"\n\nAirbus\n\nThe system, which could be adapted for other modes of transportation, features a bench seat that can be configured to hold anywhere from two passengers to a whole family.\n\nThe magic behind the Airbus seat lies with a system of adjustable seat belt and armrest placements. As a result, an airline can tailor the amount of space available to a particular passenger, based on the amount required.\n\nThe Airbus seat could ultimately revolutionize the way airlines sell tickets. Instead of the current \u00e1 la cart system, which spreads costs evenly within a class of seats, the new system would allow airlines to index pricing to the amount of space and fuel required to transport a passenger. A small child would pay less and be apportioned less room than a full-size adult.\n\nAirbus\n\nSuch a development would be particularly beneficial for families who have to pay for a full-price ticket for small children and overweight passengers, who have to purchase a second seat.\n\nSuch a scheme would fall in line with the fare rate system currently in place for the air-freight industry, which bills based on weight.\n\nWith that said, the adaptive seating and pricing system is currently only food for thought. There would have to be major logistical changes made to the airline system in order for it to go into use.", "TAP Air Portugal announced expansion plans for the USA as well as a new tie-up with JetBlue. TAP will add two U.S. routes, launching daily flights from its Lisbon hub to both New York JFK and Boston.\n\nThe Boston service starts on June 11 while JFK flights begin July 1. TAP says both routes will be operated with new Airbus A330 aircraft that the carrier will receive in June. The service returns TAP to two airports that it left last decade.\n\nTAP already flies from Lisbon to both Miami and from Newark. It also offers two weekly flights between Newark and Oporto, Portugal.\n\n\"It's really exciting to expand TAP's international service now to four U.S. gateway cities, thus offering North American travelers easy and convenient flights to Lisbon, Europe's first gateway, as well as connectivity to further destinations beyond\", TAP CEO Fernando Pinto says in a statement.\n\nTAP also announced plans for a passenger-sharing tie-up with JetBlue. Such partnerships allow airlines to sell connecting seats on each other's flights. Under the TAP-JetBlue partnership, for example, a JetBlue customer could book a single ticket from Pittsburgh to Lisbon via Boston with JetBlue flying the Pittsburgh-Boston flight and TAP flying the Boston-Lisbon flight.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPortugal's TAP Air eyes 10 new U.S. cities under ownership of JetBlue founder\n\nAmong those on hand in New York for Monday's announcement was David Neeleman. He's now part owner of TAP, but he's better known in the United States for founding JetBlue. Neeleman - who also is currently the CEO of the start-up Brazilian carrier Azul - was CEO at JetBlue from its launch in 2000 until being replaced in 2007.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBrazil's Azul Airlines continues U.S. expansion, adds new route to Florida\n\nTAP and JetBlue say they'll partner on flights from more than 20 of JetBlue's U.S. destinations, feeding TAP's flights from JFK, Boston and Newark routes with connecting passengers. JetBlue's two busiest hubs are at New York JFK and Boston. Related, TAP will operate from JetBlue's Terminal 5 at JFK and will share space with JetBlue in Boston's Terminal C.\n\n\"JetBlue is proud to help fuel the ongoing growth of international air carrier service to Boston and New York and are excited to welcome TAP into our homes in both cities,\" JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes says in the statement. \"As our 45th airline partner, TAP customers will benefit from seamless access to the JetBlue network with reduced connecting times in our state-of-the-art airport facilities. And JetBlue customers will benefit from an expanded list of international nonstop destinations from our two northeast focus cities.\"\n\nNeeleman acknowledge his ties to JetBlue in the statement, saying that \"on a personal level, it's wonderful to be back at JFK and Logan and working with JetBlue again ... .\"\n\n\"Beyond the additional flights, which is important, it's exciting that TAP is also adding new aircraft with a new cabin configuration for a much improved customer experience,\" Neeleman adds.\n\nTAP plans to take delivery of two additional Airbus A330s, which will increase its long-haul fleet to 20 aircraft.\n\nTAP says its new Executive Class cabin will feature 20 lie-flat seats and new \"slim-line\" seats in other cabins. The carrier says its seat pitch - a standard industry measure of seat space - will now be 34\" in Economy Plus and 31\" pitch in standard coach.\n\nThe A330s will seat 271 passengers, including 20 in Executive Class, 104 in Economy Plus and 147 in standard coach. TAP says all of its A330-200 fleet \"is to be retrofitted from 2017 onward\" with the new configuration.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TAv9re", "You thought that bike-saddle proposal was bad? Or that draconian stacking arrangement? Or that straight-up-bizarre hexagon seating idea?\n\nWell, Airbus has submitted a new patent for a \"re-configurable passenger bench seat,\" just to make sure you don't get too comfortable about the future of air travel -- or too comfortable on any flight itself, either. The patent proposes a bench style of seating with collapsible arm rests and adjustable seat belts, so that each row can fit a different number of people depending on their size -- kind of like a subway.\n\nIn the same space, for instance, there can be room for two:\n\nOr three:\n\nOr even four:\n\nAirbus notes in its patent filing that this \"flexible adaptation of the cabin layout\" could fit the needs of many specific groups -- like senior citizens, families with small children, and overweight people. (What it doesn't address is the inherent discomfort of sitting on a bench for hours at a time, potentially squeezed in next to complete strangers, the number of which may depend on your collective body sizes.)\n\nDon't worry just yet. Air travel companies file tons of crazy patents, and hardly any of them end up making it off the page into the real world. But with obesity on the rise worldwide, airlines would certainly stand to profit from a seating arrangement that takes physical size into account -- so maybe this particular design isn't so far-fetched.", "Birmingham Airport passengers had a lucky escape today after a plane arriving from Germany veered off the runway and ended up on a grassed area.\n\nA dramatic picture taken by a traveller on another jet showed the Airbus A320 surrounded by emergency fire and rescue vehicles.\n\nOfficials at the airport said the plane, which had just arrived from Paderborn in Germany shortly after 2pm on Sunday, was taxiing when it for unknown reasons turned off the runway.\n\nRead More: Emirates jet forced to abort landing at Birmingham Airport\n\nA spokeswoman for Birmingham Airport said the airport's rescue services rushed to the scene but there were no reports of any injuries.\n\nShe said the incident had not caused any delays for passengers on other flights.\n\nThe spokeswoman for Birmingham Airport said: \"Birmingham Airport can confirm that an A320 aircraft belonging to charter company, Small Planet, has manoeuvred off the taxiway into grass after landing from Paderborn at 13.20pm today.\n\nThere was drama at Birmingham Airport earlier this month as planes tried to land during Storm Frank\n\nClick to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started\n\n\"Passengers have safely disembarked and have been bussed to the terminal.\n\n\"There are no reports of injuries.

How did it come to this?\n\nBayern Munich told Jennings he had a future in the first team at a time when Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben were tormenting full backs. He would stay behind after training at their S\u00e4bener Strasse base to watch two of the world's best.

Jennings' mother Donna brought up her son and his older brother Michael on her own in Kensington, Liverpool -- a rough area in which, as Jennings explains, he learned to be a fighter and stuck up for himself. A life of crime with his friends was on the cards. He would often rather be with them than play football.\n\nBut then, at 15, his mother sat in front of him with tears streaming down her face and warned him he could end up in prison.\n\n'My mum raised us -- me and my brother,' he said. 'She did her best but we didn't always have everything we needed. Some of my mates who I grew up with are in jail.\n\n'Where I was brought up, it was either football or be like that, and I realised I didn't want to be like that. Football was my way out.\n\n'I was up to no good. I'd got into trouble a couple of times and I could have ended up in jail. It's not good to see your mum crying. It was a horrible thing to see.'\n\nSince returning to England Jennings has had spells at Barnsley and MK Dons, but managers at both clubs -- Lee Johnson and Karl Robinson -- publicly questioned his weight and fitness.\n\nSportsmail's Sam Cunningham sits down with Jennings at the Crowne Plaza Hotel next to John Lennon Airport\n\nJennings turns away from Nottingham Forest's Jamie Mackie during a game for Barnsley in March 2014\n\nJennings, who is about to become a father again, wants to provide for his partner Abby and daughter Mila\n\nRobinson was a youth coach at Liverpool when Jennings was there and knew there was talent, but gave up on him at the end of January.\n\n'I'm not going to lie, I am a bit overweight,' admitted Jennings. 'I need to lose weight and get fit. I'm using the time off now to work hard every day. I feel like I've let my family down and the likes of Karl and my managers at Barnsley and the fans who have supported me.\n\n'I've got to pay back my family and the people who have been there for me, so I need to work hard and get back where I should be.'\n\nJennings and his agent Neil Sang have had offers, but they are determined he gets fit before he signs for a club. He has a young family: partner Abby and two-year-old daughter Mila, with another baby on the way.\n\n'You don't want to be unemployed when you have got a family,' he said.

'I've been off with my family. I go on little tantrums. But I'm getting over that now. Mentally I've got to be stronger. Not think, 'It's all right to eat this' -- I can't do that, I can't train three times a day for a week then go and eat something c**p. It's a waste.\n\n'I want to be the best I can be and play at the highest level I can and there's only one way to do that.'\n\nJennings draws inspiration from Charlie Austin and Jamie Vardy, who are enjoying Premier League football and England call-ups later in their career.\n\n'I look at those players and think if they can do it, so can I,' he said. 'I want to do it for myself, but I want to do it for all the people who put the time and effort in for me.\n\n'I'd like to play in the Premier League.

It was so long ago that Cesc Fabregas was still with Arsenal -- never mind him joining Barcelona, being turned down by Arsene Wenger when he wanted to return to England and then winning the Premier League with Chelsea.\n\nMore importantly, Arsenal have evolved significantly since then while Barcelona have changed coach three times. Nevertheless, Wenger will be analysing the previous meetings between the sides before deciding upon his tactical approach.\n\nThe two ties against Barcelona were something of a learning experience for Arsenal. For the first contest, in 2010, Arsene Wenger was at his most frustrating in terms of tactical inflexibility; it seemed as though he barely considered the opposition when instructing his side. Arsenal seemed utterly shocked when Barcelona used their staggeringly aggressive press and Pep Guardiola's side should have been 5-0 up at half-time. Somehow the sides went in goal-less and the game eventually finished 2-2 as Barcelona's early pressing eventually left them exhausted. Lionel Messi almost single-handedly won the return game.\n\nThe next tie, in 2011, saw Arsenal prepared for the challenge. Having half-heartedly started to press midway through the previous year's first leg, Arsenal decided to play Barcelona at their own game. They pressed well, and more importantly, they coped with Barcelona's press. It remains Jack Wilshere's standout performance in an Arsenal shirt, because he was so effective at receiving the ball on the half-turn, easing past the opposition pressure, and smoothy moving forward into attack.\n\nIn the return leg, which Arsenal eventually lost narrowly after Robin van Persie's controversial dismissal, Arsenal sat much deeper and tried to frustrate Barcelona. The Catalan side eventually prevailed but Arsenal were winning 3-2 when Van Persie was dismissed.\n\nWenger must decide how to take on Barcelona: should his team press or sit deep? Realistically however, Arsenal will probably need to do both, albeit at different times.\n\nIn the opening stages, Arsenal should press and make it a high-tempo game. They've done this excellently in previous matches against this standard of opposition, particularly in the meeting with Bayern Munich a couple of seasons ago when their excellent start would have been rewarded with the lead had Mesut Ozil not missed a penalty. The blitz at home to Manchester United in October, during which Arsenal raced into a 3-0 lead, was also an example of a match where Wenger had clearly told his players to start extremely quickly.\n\nBarcelona's passing out from the back hasn't been particularly good over the past couple of months. They're still obviously the best in Europe at this concept, but there have been some nervous moments -- a narrow 2-1 away win at Malaga last month, for example, saw a ludicrous succession of errors in deep positions albeit with an unfamiliar back four. Once the tempo dropped Barca were in control, but it took a while for them to earn that control.\n\nIt's a relatively familiar theme -- even at their best under Pep Guardiola, they were most vulnerable to pressing in the opening stages. Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid side often had joy in this respect. Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, took the lead at the Camp Nou having aggressively squeezed Barcelona high up the pitch throughout the first 10 minutes, although eventually lost 2-1.\n\nArsenal have players who can press. Olivier Giroud works hard even if he's not particularly impressive in terms of stamina, while Ozil gets through more running than he's given credit for. Alexis Sanchez is the absolutely ideal player to press Barcelona given his three years at the club, while right-sided options Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott are both fine athletes and Aaron Ramsey naturally closes down rather than sits deep. Arsenal must pounce quickly. Danny Welbeck also merits a mention here; two of his best games prior to joining Arsenal were for Man United against Real Madrid in 2013, when he played off Robin van Persie and shadowed Xabi Alonso.\n\nIt's impossible to press for the entire game, however, and at some point Arsenal must retreat. This retreat probably needs to be extremely dramatic and definitely needs to be cohesive because if Arsenal stop pressing high up the pitch and continue to hold a high line, they'll be punished with long balls in behind the defence. Indeed, that was precisely their problem against Barcelona in the 2-2 draw back in 2010 -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored both goals following long balls from defence. Similarly, the winner in Barca's aforementioned recent win over Atletico came when Dani Alves knocked a simple long ball in behind for Luis Suarez, a combination that has proved effective this season.\n\nSuarez has caused Arsenal problems previously, of course. Meanwhile, it looks like Per Mertesacker will play to the right of Arsenal's centre-back partnership because Gabriel is highly doubtful due to injury. Mertesacker's lack of pace is sometimes exaggerated and against poor opposition he's fine; against Suarez and Neymar, however, you don't want to be taking any chances. Arsenal will need to drop deep.\n\nAlthough it's not their natural approach, Arsenal have occasionally proved effective at this against good Champions League opposition in recent seasons. The 1-0 win at Dortmund two seasons ago was a classic backs-to-the-wall performance while the counter-attacking 2-0 win over Guardiola's Bayern earlier this campaign saw Arsenal sitting extremely deep and soaking up pressure for long periods. Wenger praised Ozil, in particular, for getting through his defensive responsibilities well, sacrificing himself for the team. Up against Sergio Busquets, the man who usually puts Barca in control, he'll need to perform excellently for Arsenal to get a result.\n\nEven the best-laid plans can fail, of course, against arguably the most terrifying front three the Champions League has ever seen but Arsenal must be intelligent in their approach. They will probably look to starve Messi, Suarez and Neymar of service in the early stages before starving them of space for the majority of the game.\n\nWith a bit of luck and a Petr Cech masterclass, Arsenal will have half a chance.", "GermanyInterview: Rafinha Talks Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola and Bastian Schweinsteiger\n\nFollow @insidefutbol\n\nTottenham Hotspur winger Erik Lamela has insisted that his focus is only on the north London outfit and indicated that he is not interested in a move back to Italy at the moment.\n\nSpurs paid a princely sum of \u00a330m to Roma in the summer of 2013 to take the Argentine to north London, and after struggling in his initial years at White Hart Lane, Lamela is finally coming good under Mauricio Pochettino this season.\n\nThe winger was a revelation for Roma during his time in Italy, and with him struggling at Tottenham initially, there were rumours the 23-year-old was keen to return to Italy to revive his career.\n\nThere was speculation that a few of the top Serie A sides were keen to sign him, but Lamela insisted that he doesn't understand the source of the rumours as he is happy at Tottenham.", "GermanyInterview: Rafinha Talks Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola and Bastian Schweinsteiger\n\nFollow @insidefutbol\n\nArsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin believes that his experience with Charlton Athletic proved to be a stepping stone in his career.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who has managed to establish himself as a regular in Arsene Wenger's team since his return from a loan spell at the Valley, insists that the experience at the Championship club was unbelievable.\n\nThe emergency loan move, which lasted for just over a month, gave the youngster the chance to play \"week in and week out\" which he believes was great.\n\nAs a result, the former France Under-21 international insists that he came back to his parent club stronger and never needed the chance to look back.\n\n\"Every time I got the chance to say a little word about Charlton, I'm doing it because I had a great time over there\", Coquelin told his club's official website.\n\n\"I met great people there.\n\n\"They gave me a little taste of playing football again, week in and week out.

Try to view it as less a tax and more an investment opportunity.\n\nThe levy, introduced in England in October, has resulted in an almost 80 per cent drop in the number of bags taken home by supermarket shoppers. Similar reductions in use were seen in Scotland following the charge being introduced a year earlier.\n\nHowever, reusing bags has had a more surprising consequence with 'classic' items becoming sought-after fashion accessories. Online auction sites such eBay have become a trading ground with some exchanging hands for way above their face value (which, to be fair, was originally \u00a30.00).\n\nBut a bag can be more than just a means to carry your latest purchase - it's an extension of your personality, particularly if brand loyalty is part of your makeup. Take Apple. Take an apple. Much safer than waving your iPhone 6 around in public or getting mugged for your watch is the option of a humble homage to the consumerist philosophy of Steve Jobs - even if it contains a Samsung, or your lunch. Classic Apple-branded bags are usually opaque, and crop up on eBay for more than a fiver - but still less than the cost of an iPad.\n\nSimilarly, although perhaps appealing to a different market, there's the gold JD sports bag - a brightly coloured plastic drawstring carrier which sells for around \u00a36 on eBay.\n\nAnd Arsenal fans were presented with commemorative plastic bags at a Champions League match against Bayern Munich, with instructions to hold the white carrier aloft. Since then, the bags have become sought-after, going for a fiver, around the same price as a copy of the match programme.\n\nOf course, the line between carrier and fashion accessory has long been blurred with Adidas and Nike-emblazoned sports holdalls being aped by the likes of D&G and Mulberry in their rather more upmarket version of the shopping bag.\n\nBut on a more serious note, up to a trillion bags per year are used worldwide, doing immeasurable damage to the environment. However, among the nominees for Design of the Year at London's Design Museum was The Ocean Cleanup - a network of floating barriers which uses natural currents to push plastics towards land for collection and disposal. The project has already raised $2m via a crowdfunding campaign.\n\nHowever, the soundest investments may eventually be in the ever-lucrative art world. Fashion designer Anya Hindmarch has already taken a High Street chwemist's plastic bag to its logical conclusion, designing a pair of plastic Boots (geddit?) around the classic logo. And... well, does this jumper from Christopher Shannon's AW14 collection remind you of anything? Looks like a bag could be for life after all...", "So now we know one of the ways Mario Balotelli was passing his time during the long injury lay-off, which dampened hopes that his return to AC Milan would quickly rejuvenate his career and the fortunes of the club he grew up supporting.\n\nHe was, in December, busy composing a tribute to his friend, Kevin-Prince Boateng.\n\nBoateng, who has recently rejoined Balotelli at Milan, released his memoir I, Prince. My Life, My Game, My Reckoning in Germany this weekend.\n\nTurn the first few pages, and you reach the prologue contributed by Balotelli.\n\nEvidently thrilled that Boateng would, for the second spell in both their chequered careers, again become his companion in the Milan dressing-room, he looks forward to reviving the wagers they used to share about who could show \"the most eccentric fashion sense\" or turn up in the car with the most bling.\n\nHow much the management of Milan - whose coach Sinisa Mihajlovic left a heavy hint that he was dissatisfied with Balotelli's application when the much-travelled striker made his latest appearance as a substitute, against Genoa - will enjoy the reunion of these two serial mavericks remains to be seen.\n\nPrince, as Boateng prefers to be known, \"is a dressing-room joker, a mega-entertainer\", Balotelli enthuses, \"he even makes Silvio Berlusconi - the Milan president - burst out laughing\".\n\nBoateng's life has not always been so full of mirth. In the years before he moon-danced through the celebrations of Milan's 2011 Serie A title - the last peak of a club who are in a long, stubborn slump - he had become notorious in his native Germany.\n\nHe was born to privileged genes, or so his mother told him, as the great nephew of Helmut Rahn, a member of Germany's 1954 World Cup-winning team. His half-brother, Jerome, with whom he shares a father, won the 2014 World Cup with Germany.\n\nBoateng's childhood gave him few material advantages. The Berlin district, Wedding, where he grew up \"may not be a classic ghetto\", he writes, \"but it's hard to live there and not end up on the wrong path\". He had witnessed an urban gunfight by the age of 10, he reports.\n\nRead more: Napoli out to prove they are still 'alive and kicking' against AC Milan\n\nAlso see: Barcelona, Juventus and Bayern Munich are the top-3 in The National's European Top 20 Power Table\n\nBoateng chose the wrong path on many occasions as a teenager, though his talent at football shone out at Hertha Berlin, whose academy he was enrolled in.\n\nHe was capped regularly at youth level for Germany but after disciplinary issues and failing to progress as a player as anticipated, chose to represent Ghana, with whom he went to two World Cups, the last of which, in Brazil ended in acrimony with the management. His story has many such rows in it.\n\nAmong the most prominent is the one with Michael Ballack, the former German captain, who Boateng injured with a late tackle in the 2010 FA Cup final - Boateng was then at Portsmouth, who lost to Ballack's Chelsea - and thus ruled Ballack out of that summer's World Cup.\n\nHe writes he received death threats from Germans, racist abuse in the street, as a result but that unnamed members of the Germany squad also sent him messages saying they were pleased Ballack would not be with them for the tournament.\n\nThere had been an edge between the two since Boateng, now 28, was a rookie, he reports.\n\n\"Who do you think you are?\" Boateng apparently said to Ballack during a match between Hertha and Bayern Munich, then Ballack's club. \"A star,\" Ballack replied, according to the Boateng memoir.\n\nThere is plenty of reckoning in the pages detailing a career that has switched between three clubs in Germany, two each in Italy and England.\n\n\"I haven't always given 100 per cent,\" Boateng owns up. \"I should have achieved more.\"\n\nMilan, who brought Boateng back after he had fallen out with Schalke, hope that means he has resolved to make up for the squandered opportunities, and that he might even help guide Balotelli towards greater fulfilment, too.\n\nPlayer to watch\n\nRenato Sanches - Aged 18, the prolific scorer for Benfica in Portugal does not appear to be able to go a week without being linked to a big-money move to one of Europe's big clubs.\n\nRapid rise\n\nRenato began the season with Benfica B, playing in the second division. He had only turned 18 in August. He made his debut as a substitute against Tondela in the Primeira Liga at the end of October and has not looked back. A goal in his second start, against Coimbra, preceded a senior five-and-a-half year contract, signed in December.\n\nBackground\n\nRenato was born in Lisbon and grew up on the outskirts of the Portuguese capital. His family come from Cabo Verde, the islands off the coast of West Africa whose diaspora includes a number of talented footballers, from Swedish striker Henrik Larsson, to the former France midfielder Patrick Vieira, to the Portuguese international winger Nani.\n\nAcademy past\n\nRenato is committed to representing the land of his birth and has played for Portugal at various age-group levels 40 times. He was attached to Benfica's youth system throughout his teens. \"He's a reflection of the work of our academy, and the club should be proud of that,\" Benfica head coach Rui Vitoria said last week.\n\nBuyout clause\n\nRenato's new contract reportedly includes an \u20ac80 million (Dh325.6m) buyout clause. The hype around him has been busy in the last two months, with comparisons made with Juventus' Paul Pogba, for his creativity and eye for goals from distance, and with the former Netherlands midfielder, Edgar Davids. He has been linked with Manchester United and Real Madrid among others.\n\nEuro 2016 bound?\n\nIn the short term, before they cash in, Benfica hope he can galvanise their defence of the league title, where they trail Porto. They also hope he can help the club into the last eight of the Uefa Champions League. There is a chance he may earn a spot in Portugal's squad for Euro 2016, as well.\n\nMatch of the week\n\nBayern Munich could make club history on Saturday as a clean sheet against Darmstadt in the Bundesliga would see Pep Guardiola's side go a record six home games without conceding a goal.\n\nArsenal were the last club to score against Bayern at Munich's Allianz Arena back in November when Olivier Giroud scored the London side's consolation in a 5-1 loss.\n\nSince that Uefa Champions League group game, Bayern have won all five of their home games in all competitions without conceding a goal and hold an eight-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga.\n\nGuardiola's team are in no mood to give Darmstadt any hope of a first win in Munich in their final match before their Champions League last-16, first-leg clash at Juventus next Tuesday.\n\nThis is especially as Darmstadt have picked up 17 of their 24 points this season away from home.\n\n\"They will play very deep and very compact,\" Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso said. \"We will have to be patient and it'll be important to get the first goal.\n\n\"It's all about Darmstadt for now, we want to keep our eight-point lead. Only afterwards will we think about Juventus.\"\n\nWith 21 goals to his credit, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored almost as many goals as the 22 the entire Darmstadt team have managed.\n\nThe visitors' cause is not helped by a raft of suspensions.

There is so much more to my life than football.\"\n\nThat does not mean Guardiola, who won the Champions League twice at Barca and is heading for a third straight Bundesliga crown, has lost his reputation as a brilliant general.\n\nNow, though, comes a monumental test of his mastery as he tries to work out the conundrum of how to stop an in-form Juve side that he describes as the best operators at set-pieces when he has only a makeshift defence to work with.\n\nINJURY PROBLEMS\n\n\"We have some problems (with injuries) and we need to find a way to solve them. We are missing all of our central defenders at the moment and no one is really available,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"Of course, we have Serdar Tasci and (Medhi) Benatia. One has just arrived and the other has only resumed training three or four days ago but that is the situation and we shouldn't complain and try to work with the players that are available.\"\n\nFormer Germany international Tasci joined this month on loan from Spartak Moscow to plug the gaps left by injured central defenders Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez before centre back Holger Badstuber fractured his ankle just over a week ago.\n\n\"We've got to attack intelligently and avoid conceding set-pieces as they are maybe the best team in Europe from set pieces.\"\n\nJuve, last year's beaten finalists, come into the game with huge confidence, a 0-0 draw on Friday at Bologna ending a run of 13 straight wins. It was their ninth successive clean sheet.\n\n\"Juve, naturally, have achieved a lot in the past four years, first with (Antonio) Conte and now with Massimiliano) Allegri, they've managed to achieve great things.\n\n\"Juventus always approach each match with the attitude that they must win it. They didn't get off to a very good start this season but they've now... shown great quality so I believe this will be an interesting match.\"\n\n\"It would be important for us to score an away goal, but Juve have a very strong defence and it's up to us to play with intelligence. We'll try to win the first leg and then control the second.\"\n\n(Reporting by Ian Chadband; Editing by Ken Ferris)", "Finishing second in their Champions League qualifying group was always going to present Juventus with problems.\n\nIf there were two teams every club wanted to avoid, they were Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and sadly the Bianconeri were handed a stern test when they were drawn against the Bundelsiga champs. But daunting as the opponent may seem, is it really impossible to beat Pep Guardiola's team?\n\nWhat the Catalan tactician has created in Bavaria is a side full of beauty because of its many intricacies. Akin to a beautiful watch with complicated movements, Guardiola's Bayern side move and occupy spaces in elaborate fashion, not in the straightforward way Barcelona managed before them. Fluid, intelligent and well-balanced, each player understands what space he must occupy in order to facilitate the attacking movements of a side boasting some of the very best players in the world.\n\nHowever, while their complex system is bound to overcome the vast number of opponents they face, many of whom opt for basic, clean tactics in the Bundesliga, the Champions League is a tournament that offers a variety of tactical obstacles that may not be as easy to defeat. We have already seen how the Germans suffered against Porto and Arsenal, especially when the team plays away from home. In fact, in their last seven away matches, they have lost four.\n\nFor all their attacking beauty and tactical intricacy, the 2013 Champions League winners are still a team with too many defensive woes that become increasingly more apparent away from the Allianz Arena. It's been widely reported that the reason Juventus vs. Bayern Munich is a more even test now than it was when the draw took place is because the Bavarians are now dealing with several injuries at the back. However, even if they weren't, this is a team set up to attack, and when forced to defend, they struggle against those forwards who run at them with pace, players willing to take them on.\n\nA side with impeccable possession stats, without the ball, they suffer both tactically and psychologically. Psychologically because, unlike other teams in more competitive leagues, they rarely concede the first goal and are made to stage a comeback, though they managed to do so against Darmstadt at the weekend.\n\nBayern's system can cause problems in that the players may suffer to rearrange themselves defensively when their opponent wins back possession. It's for this reason the counter-attack is a reasonable strategy to adopt by the Italians as long as it remains an option and not the only strategy going forward. Guardiola has already predicted the Italians will defend in numbers before unleashing their forwards quickly, and thus would have prepared for it. As such, it's crucial Massimiliano Allegri keeps his opponent guessing, perhaps switching formations and using the substitutes bench to his advantage.\n\nIn games such as these, Alvaro Morata's quality becomes imperative largely because he relishes the big challenges, scoring in the matches that almost seem impossible to resolve. More than that, he is a huge threat on the counter, boasting decent pace, ball control and athleticism that will most definitely terrify a Bayern back line that could be forced to play without a recognised centre-back.\n\nIn the match against Darmstadt, Serdar Tasci proved he is nothing more than a fourth-option player considering how capable he is of losing focus and conceding ground. As for Mehdi Benatia, he has only just recovered from injury. The absences will make it that much easier for the likes for Paulo Dybala and his forward companions to pull the defence apart and create space for themselves, especially if the midfielder tasked with aiding the defence is Xabi Alonso, who has struggled to play a clean game when overwhelmed.\n\nAllegri is the kind of coach who strongly believes in the power of his substitutions. And while it often works out for him, the hope is the team he chooses to start do not concede many to render those possible substitutions irrelevant. It's likely he might choose to start Mario Mandzukic for two reasons: The first being that the Croatian holds up play well to allow the talent of Dybala and Paul Pogba to shine. But the other, and perhaps more important, is that the forward will be desperate to prove to Bayern and Guardiola that his departure was a loss to the side. A player capable of frustrating centre-backs, one hopes his injury will not have hindered his ability in attack.\n\nPerhaps not yet capable of playing a full 90 minutes, it's likely Mandzukic will be substituted, and who better to come on in his place than Morata, who can then use his energy and power to punish a more tired Bayern in the latter stage of the match.\n\nThis is a German giant accustomed to winning and enjoys being in control. Juve's best chance of rattling their superior, and more experienced, opponent is by providing the Bundesliga club with an uncomfortable and unpredictable environment, and Allegri is the perfect coach for the challenge. Juve may not win, but they should certainly not be underestimated and as long as they believe they are good enough, they have a great opportunity to demonstrate their own perfection.", "Arsene Wenger will look to ensure Arsenal do not concede an away goal when they host Barcelona in the Champions League -- saying he would settle for a second stalemate in a matter of days.\n\nThe Gunners boss has always been an advocate of attacking football but that philosophy has seen his side endure a torrid run in the knockout stages of the competition as they have not got past the round of 16 for the past five years.\n\nDuring that time Arsenal have made life hard for themselves by losing the first legs to AC Milan, twice to Bayern Munich and then to Monaco last year.\n\nIn facing holders Barcelona, Wenger knows his team are coming up against the strongest attacking team in world football -- with the attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar having scored 91 goals between them so far this season.\n\nArsenal go into the tie on the back of a goalless FA Cup fifth-round draw at home to Championship club Hull.\n\nWhile that result left fans trudging out of the Emirates Stadium at the weekend, Wenger would embrace another 0-0 draw on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I think we will score tomorrow so I am not too much concerned,\" he said. \"But it's true that recently our goals have dried up a bit and that we have to find a way to get that going again.\n\n\"I am more concerned tomorrow about stopping them from scoring because you can say even at home in the Champions League that 0-0 is not a bad score.\n\n\"Recently we always made it difficult for ourselves by conceding goals at home and basically the rules of the modern European Cup encourage you to defend at home and attack away because of the importance of the away goal.\n\n\"Many times I said that should be suppressed because if you concede a goal at home in the Champions League it is a knife in your heart every time. Against big, big teams it becomes very difficult.\"\n\nWhile Arsenal have failed to score in four of their last seven games, Barcelona have drawn a blank just three times all season across all competitions and have knocked the Gunners out of the Champions League twice in the last six years.\n\nBut Wenger says he cannot simply send his team out to play for a draw and believes a win can still be achieved even if they are ultimately outplayed.\n\nAsked if he was planning to select a more defensive line-up, the Frenchman replied: \"It's a bit against my nature. I cannot go into a game and think I will just play for a 0-0.\n\n\"I believe you cannot say you are a big club and you just want to defend. On the other hand, Barcelona are a very offensive team. So to give you no chance at all to score against them is guilty as well.\n\n\"You have to try to score against them because if they have a vulnerability like we have it is defensively like with any offensive team.\n\n\"It is quite funny because the one year we beat them, they played us off the park but we still won the game. That can happen.\n\n\"We played Hull and it was 0-0, we can go to Sheffield Wednesday [in the Capital One Cup] and lose 3-0. So why can't it be possible the other way around?\"", "Barcelona and Arsenal looked fairly equal when they met in the 2006 final but since then one has gone on to rule the world, the other chose stability under Wenger\n\nJust under 10 years ago, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger took his Arsenal team to Paris to play Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona in the Champions League final. The two sides looked fairly evenly matched. Barcelona were the best team in Spain, Arsenal had just been knocked off their perch as the best side in England. Each had one genuine world-class player, in Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry respectively. Barcelona had won just one European Cup before, Arsenal were in their first final. This was just before the era of the European superclub and the two outfits met on a relatively even footing. Barcelona scraped home 2-1 in a tight game.\n\nTen years on, Bar\u00e7a have now won five Champions League titles, with Arsenal still stuck on none. Barcelona are the biggest football brand in the world, while Arsenal, for all their steady progress off the pitch, are in the second tier of global clubs. Barcelona are at the very top. So what happened?\n\nLionel Messi\n\nThe Argentine striker missed the 2006 Champions League final with a hamstring injury and was so upset that he could not bring himself to celebrate afterwards. He was 18 years old, still breaking into Rijkaard's team and had scored just nine goals for Barcelona.\n\nRead more How super Suarez nudged Messi aside\n\nMessi's grand tally of Barcelona goals now stands at an implausible 439. He has won the Ballon d'Or for five of the last seven years. Bar\u00e7a's successes in that time would be unimaginable without him. He scored in the 2009 and 2011 finals, and was instrumental in their 2015 win, dismantling Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich in the semi-final first leg. \"Messi was injured in 2006,\" reflected Wenger yesterday. \"But you have seen the damage he has done since.\"\n\nThere are many ways to explain Barcelona's success but often in football the obvious answer is the right one.\n\n\"One thing is a team, another thing is a team with Messi, it's a different story,\" Jose Mourinho said last year. \"He played in a Champions League final with Guardiola, he is playing in a Champions League final with Luis Enrique. And if one day he plays for Anthony [Portuguese for \"Joe Bloggs\"], Anthony will go to a Champions League final with him. So when people analyse teams, you have to remember that this boy makes everything different. He makes everything different.\"\n\nPep Guardiola\n\nThat explanation from Mourinho may do a slight disservice, however, to Guardiola. Even given the quality of players at his disposal, there is no question that Guardiola transformed Barcelona when he replaced Rijkaard in 2008. He inherited a group of talented players who had passed their best and lost focus. He got rid of Ronaldinho and Deco, and the rest of the squad knew that they had to come with Guardiola or they would be out.\n\nGuardiola transformed Barcelona into a football machine, playing a fast, intense, pressing and passing game that we had not seen before. Bar\u00e7a had great individuals, but it was Guardiola who turned them into relentless winners. In his four seasons at the Nou Camp, they collected three La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues, two Copa del Reys and two Club World Cups. That is why he was in so much demand when he left the Nou Camp in 2012, and again this year, from the other richest clubs in Europe. Arsenal, by contrast, have stuck with Wenger, ensuring consistency and stability through a difficult time. But when have they looked like moving to the next level?\n\nTransfers\n\nWhen asked at his press conference yesterday why Arsenal had fallen so far behind Barcelona, Wenger gave a very clear answer. \"The difference is that Barcelona have spent much more money than we have, it's as simple as that,\" he said. \"In 2006, it was already the case. They already had stars on the way up. And they bought Neymar. We could not have bought Neymar. Maybe today we can.\"\n\nBarcelona have certainly been able to bring in a level of player beyond the reach of Arsenal, long before their \u00a371m purchase of Neymar in 2014. Wenger tried to sign Luis Suarez for \u00a340m in 2013, one year later he went to Barcelona for \u00a375m. That investment of almost \u00a3150m in fees alone is what has built this latest version of Barcelona. To say nothing of the money spent on Dani Alves (\u00a323m in 2008), David Villa (\u00a330m in 2010), Jordi Alba (\u00a311m in 2012), Ivan Rakitic (\u00a316m in 2014) and the rest. They even signed Henry, Cesc Fabregas, Alex Song and Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal, leveraging their superior resources and profile to pick off some of the Gunners' best players.\n\nThe Emirates\n\nWhile Barcelona were cashing in on the unbalanced Spanish television deals, and deciding to abandon their commitment to unsponsored shirts, Arsenal were paying for their very expensive new stadium. The 2006 Champions League final straddled the Highbury and Emirates Stadium eras, and as soon as Arsenal moved they had to start paying the \u00a3390m bill for it, in part by selling their best players.\n\n\"We suffered a lot to build this stadium,\" Wenger said last month. \"We have to be very tight financially to pay it back.\"\n\nBarcelona have no such concerns. They are a commercial giant and last season, when they won the treble, the club turnover was \u20ac608m (\u00a3470m). Their president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, has targeted an annual turnover of \u20ac1bn by the end of his term in 2021, and that does not sound so ridiculous.\n\nBarcelona 4-1 Arsenal (6-3 aggregate) 2010\n\nLionel Messi showcased his genius by scoring four goals in the second leg to send Arsenal crashing out. Nicklas Bendtner put the visitors ahead on the night, after the first leg had finished 2-2, before Messi scored a first-half hat-trick.\n\nBarcelona 3-1 Arsenal (4-3 aggregate) 2011\n\nBar\u00e7a lost the first leg 2-1, but took the lead at the Nou Camp through Messi's chip. Arsenal levelled on the night thanks to Sergio Busquets' own goal but Robin van Persie was controversially sent off for kicking the ball after the referee had blown for offside. Xavi made it 2-1, then a Messi penalty settled the tie.\n\nMore about: Fc Barcelona Arsenal Arsene Wenger", "Olivier Giroud is confident that Arsenal can beat an \"unstoppable\" Barcelona side.\n\nLuis Enrique's men are unbeaten in 32 games in all competitions, while their front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar have already scored 91 goals this season.\n\nBayern Munich were in a similar vein of form before Arsenal beat them at Emirates Stadium in October, and Giroud says that victory will give the Gunners confidence ahead of Tuesday's last-16 first-leg against Barcelona.\n\n\"We would love to beat them because they look unstoppable,\" he said. \"We need to play our best game all together and at 100 per cent. Otherwise we're not going to play this game and we're going to lose it.\n\n\"We are confident, we need to be confident and play the Arsenal way. We did well against Munich. We know that we can beat big teams but there is one thing for sure: we need to be at 100 per cent and be determined.\n\n\"We just need to focus and give 100 per cent all together with good team cohesion. After that we will put what we need into this game - a lot of commitment and determination. We managed that against Bayern and that will help us to win.\n\n\"We did very well against Olympiacos to qualify as it was very hard. We are looking forward to playing Barcelona who are maybe the best team in the world today. We are going to play our game.\"", "Arsenal manager knows the importance of a clean sheet in home legs but admits he is tempted to attack the holders\n\n\"If you concede a goal at home in the Champions League,\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said yesterday, \"it is a knife in your heart every time.\" The Arsenal manager knows the feeling too well. His team have been eliminated from the first knockout round for the last five consecutive seasons, three of those after losing the first leg at home, all to teams less good than the one they will face tonight.\n\nThis is the hardest balance in football, knowing how to prepare for a Champions League first leg at home. Tonight Arsenal must solve it, against the best team of their generation. Wenger's nature, his squad, and his pride in being a big club all tell him to attack, because, as he said, being \"audacious\" is \"what you will need to be against Barcelona\".\n\nOn the other hand, there is the simple fact that Barcelona are probably the best attacking team of all time, with the three best forwards in the world all playing together.\n\nNot only will stopping them be very difficult indeed, it will also be absolutely necessary. The away goals rule, which Wenger opposes, means that Arsenal will almost end their chances of progress if they concede more than one tonight.\n\nIn each of the last three seasons Arsenal have eliminated themselves by losing badly at home at this stage: 3-1 to Bayern Munich in 2013, 2-0 to the same opponents in 2014, and, most traumatically of all, 3-1 to Monaco this time last year. And Barcelona are a very different proposition from those sides. So how do Arsenal approach the game?\n\n\"I think we will score tomorrow so I am not too concerned about that,\" Wenger said. \"But I am more concerned tomorrow about stopping them from scoring. Because you can say even at home in the Champions League that 0-0 is not a bad score. Recently we made it always difficult for ourselves by conceding goals at home.\n\n\"The rules of the modern European Cup encourage you to defend at home and attack away because of the importance of the away goal. Many times I said that should be suppressed, because if you concede a goal at home in the Champions League it's a knife in your heart every time. Against big, big teams it becomes very difficult.\"\n\nRead more How super Suarez nudged Messi aside\n\nThere might be a case for digging in, parking the bus, hoping for a 0-0 and then playing the same way at the Nou Camp in pursuit of an away goal. In the absence of an obvious way to defeat Barcelona, that plan would be as good as any. But Wenger said that his own record and values, as well as the self-esteem of his club, would not allow him to do that.\n\n\"It's a bit against my nature,\" Wenger admitted. \"I cannot go into a game and think I will just play for a 0-0. You cannot say you are a big club and you just want to defend. On the other hand, Barcelona is a very offensive team. To give yourself no chance at all to score against them is guilty as well. You have to try to score against them because if they have a vulnerability, like we have, it is defensively like with any offensive team.\"\n\nArsenal would be better equipped to play that way tonight than they have been in recent years. Part of Arsenal's recent improvement has been their defensive stabilisation, their ability to win games without the ball, most memorably at Manchester City last season and against Bayern Munich in October.\n\n\"We defend better,\" Wenger said. \"We can defend when it is needed. Football is simple. It is about, at that level, quality and experience. For a number of years we had players of 20, 21, 22. You become a top-level player between 23 and 30. It is as simple as that. Today we could do that better because our young players have more experience.\"\n\nMore about: Arsenal Fc Barcelona Arsene Wenger", "Return to video Video settings\n\nPlease Log in to update your video settings\n\nVideo will begin in 5 seconds.\n\nDon't play Play now More video Recommended\n\nMatt Lodge video shows 'complete lack of remorse'\n\nPattinson strikes for Aussies\n\nRoux suffers unluckiest of breaks\n\nKyrgios lands maiden title in Marseille\n\nAustralia clinch back-to-back Sevens titles\n\nReplay video Return to video Video settings\n\nPlease Log in to update your video settings\n\nPlays Of The Week\n\nFrom slam dunks to double tons, these are the most exciting, silly and downright crazy plays in the sport world this week.\n\nPT1M33S 620 349\n\nThe ominous size of the task that will confront Arsenal at the Emirates on Wednesday morning (AEDT) is summed up in a single fact.\n\nWhile Arsene Wenger openly described the concession of a European away goal as a \"knife in your heart\", the simple truth is that Barcelona have been prevented from scoring only once this season in 31 matches in La Liga and the Champions League.\n\nWith the near certainty of having to absorb significant internal damage during 180 minutes on the pitch with the best team in the world, the question for Arsenal is how best to limit those incisions while retaining a threat of their own.\n\nReady to make a point: Alexis Sanchez.

Who is the Gunners' biggest threat? Sportsmail columnists Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp answer the key questions ahead the crunch clash.\n\nArsenal boss Arsene Wenger oversees training on Monday as he attempts to devise a plan to stop Barcelona\n\nHow can Arsenal beat Barcelona in the first leg?\n\nJAMIE CARRAGHER\n\nThe best hope Arsenal have of getting a first-leg advantage is to forget about trying to out-pass Barcelona and instead play a more direct style.\n\nThey have to look to exploit Javier Mascherano's lack of height by firing balls into Olivier Giroud.\n\nArsenal had success against Bayern Munich in the group stage, when Giroud scored the first in a 2-0 win at The Emirates Stadium, playing in such a way and that is something they need to remember.\n\nGunners striker Oliveri Giroud could have a key role to play if Arsenal opt to play a more direct style\n\nMARTIN KEOWN\n\nThey need a combination of keeping possession when they win the ball back and trying to catch them out with longer passes, particularly into the channels. Barcelona test your ability on the ball by pressing you, running around in a frantic fashion. If you're calm, play three or four passes, you'll keep it and they'll melt away; if you panic, they will win it back.\n\nIf you can combine that with some early long balls at decisive moments you can punish their full-backs. Arsene Wenger might be toying with the idea of playing Danny Welbeck up top, depending on his fitness. His pace could give him the edge over Olivier Giroud for this match. With Alexis Sanchez out on the left, Wenger will need Mesut Ozil feeding them the right passes.\n\nMartin Keown believes Arsenal will need Mesut Ozil (right) in form if they are to slice through Barca's defence\n\nJAMIE REDKNAPP\n\nAt the moment, nobody can seem to find a way to beat Barcelona. It is about beating that initial press when you have ball in your own half. If you do that, then you can beat Barca's back four, but it's easier said than done. Ask Gary Neville - he'll tell you how difficult it is.\n\nArsenal must be extremely brave on the ball because if you lose it in your own half, you can find it's in the back of the net before you know it. My feeling is Wenger will go with Olivier Giroud for set pieces and height. Arsenal must make set pieces count - especially free-kicks in wide areas. But they will have to play the perfect game to get out of this one unscathed.\n\nArsenal have to beat Barcelona's initial high press if they are to have a chance, according to Jamie Redknapp\n\nWho is the biggest threat to Arsenal: Neymar, Suarez or Messi?\n\nREDKNAPP\n\nMessi - he always has been and always will be. Without Suarez or Neymar, Barcelona are still amazing, but Messi takes them to another level. They can survive without the others but without Messi you've got a chance. The other two are incredible but Messi is from another planet.\n\nLionel Messi remains Barcelona's key threat, says Redknapp and claims he takes the team to another level\n\nCARRAGHER\n\nI can't believe I'm not going to say Lionel Messi for this answer but it has to be Luis Suarez. He is the best centre-forward in the world at the moment.\n\nHe is enjoying his football and the chemistry between him, Messi and Neymar is something that we have never seen before.\n\nHe's gone to a different level from the form he showed for Liverpool and he will want to show crowds in England what they are missing.\n\nLuis Suarez has scored an incredible 12 goals in his last seven games and is the dangerman, says Carragher\n\nKEOWN\n\nIt still has to be Lionel Messi. Luis Suarez is undoubtedly their most in-form player this season and Neymar covers so much ground for them, but Messi missed a large part of the campaign through injury and is back now. He's still the king.\n\nThe front three enable Barcelona to set up what I'd call the Barcelona footballing map. Their movement off the ball is as exceptional as it is on it. Suarez pushes high and central, Messi is on the right drifting inside and Neymar is wide left. When Messi has the ball, Neymar is virtually touching the touchline and Suarez is forcing the centre halves back. It also allows Andres Iniesta or Sergi Roberto to move into the space and if one player adopts a different position, another replaces them. Messi is still the crucial component in all of that.\n\nKeown believes Suarez is the most in-form but insists Messi remains the biggest threat to Arsenal\n\nSum up Barcelona in three words...\n\nCARRAGHER\n\nDecade of domination.\n\nREDKNAPP\n\nChanged football forever.\n\nKEOWN\n\nMessi, Suarez, Neymar.\n\nBarcelona certainly looked in high spirits during training on Monday ahead of the crucial first leg\n\nPredict the first-leg score...\n\nKEOWN\n\nThere has always been a tight first leg between these two in the knock-out stages, so it's most likely to be a draw. 2-2.\n\nREDKNAPP\n\n1-1. Arsenal must stay in the game and ride their luck, but I do think they can nick a draw.\n\nCARRAGHER\n\nBarcelona are unstoppable and win 2-1.\n\nNone of Sportsmail's columnists are backing Arsenal to take a lead back to Catalonia for the return leg", "The ominous size of the task that will confront Arsenal at the Emirates on Tuesday night is summed up in a single fact.\n\nWhile Ars\u00e8ne Wenger on Monday openly described the concession of a European away goal as a \"knife in your heart\", the simple truth is that Barcelona have been prevented from scoring only once this season in 31 matches in La Liga and the Champions League.\n\n* Neymar fully primed to become the world's best\n\nWith the near certainty, then, of having to absorb significant internal damage during 180 minutes on the pitch with the best team in the world, the question for Arsenal is how best to limit those incisions while retaining a threat of their own.\n\nWenger knows how important it is to keep a home clean sheet\n\nWenger, as ever, is adamant that attack must form at least part of his team's defence. \"I think we will score,\" he said. \"I cannot go into a game and think I will just play for a 0-0. It is against my nature. We need to find the right balance between being audacious - because that is what you will need - and being strong defensively as a unit.\n\n\"Barcelona is a very offensive team so you have to try to score against them because, if they have a vulnerability, like we have, it is defensively.\"\n\n* Just how do Arsenal beat Barcelona?\n\nAlthough Wenger did then acknowledge the possible nightmare scenario of simply being \"played off the park\" by Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Neymar, Iniesta and Co, he did also repeatedly emphasise that they do have deficiencies. Compared to Pep Guardiola's Barcelona, Wenger believes that the current vintage of Luis Enrique are less dominant in possession but more incisive with their attacks.\n\n\"They are not far from it but no team is perfect; our world is not perfect,\" he said. \"They are the best team in the world. Nobody questions that but in football ... we played Hull and it was 0-0. We can go to Sheffield Wednesday and lose 3-0. So why can't it be possible the other way around? We have to use every moment in the game where we have the chance to score.\"\n\nCan any defence in the world realistically hope to stop this strike force?\n\nSome hope can certainly be found in Arsenal's performances against the very best opposition over the past year. Consecutive wins against both Manchester United and Manchester City, as well as that surprise 2-0 victory against Guardiola's Bayern Munich, have underlined an enhanced capacity to absorb pressure and play on the counterattack.\n\nThe presence of a genuinely defensive midfielder in Francis Coquelin, as well as a genuinely world-class goalkeeper in Petr Cech, are tangible differences. Indeed, while Lionel Messi has amassed 430 goals for Barcelona in the 10 years since they beat Arsenal in the 2006 Champions League final, Cech is one of the few leading goalkeepers that he has still never scored past.\n\nWenger accepts that Arsenal fell decisively behind Barcelona after 2006 but believes that the landscape has again shifted and that his club can now compete for the world's best talent. In players such as Cech, Mesut \u00d6zil, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Santi Cazorla and Per Mertesacker, the Arsenal squad certainly have many more proven winners than when they were eliminated by Barcelona in 2010 and 2011.\n\nMesut Ozil will be key to Arsenal's chances\n\n\"The difference was that Barcelona spent much more money,\" said Wenger. \"In 2006, they also had stars on the way up. They had Messi and Iniesta. They bought Neymar. We could not have bought Neymar. Maybe today we can. Today the English clubs can do it. Real and Barcelona; the dimension of these two clubs is not only financial. It is historical, symbolic of big, big clubs but I believe that financially the English clubs can compete with them.\n\n\"We are better equipped in the way we have assembled experience now. For a number of years we had players of 20, 21, 22. You become a top level player between 23 and 30. It's as simple as that. There's no genius behind it.\"\n\n* Where are Arsenal and Barcelona's 2006 finalists now?\n\nOne of those established players is S\u00e1nchez, who Arsenal signed from Barcelona in 2014. \"He will be fired up, but that doesn't mean he will be in the right zone,\" said Wenger. \"It is more difficult to prepare against Hull than Barcelona, because against Barcelona everyone is naturally focused. It is more to create belief and confidence. Against Hull it is more to raise the urgency level. The performance zone is where you are focused and relaxed. Sometimes when you play against your former club you are not necessarily in that zone.\"\n\nLuis Suarez will be fired up to meet Arsenal\n\nSo will he have a word with S\u00e1nchez about striking the right balance? \"A little word, yes,\" he said.\n\nAfter generally blowing their chances in the first leg before being beaten at this stage of the Champions League in each of the past five seasons, Wenger will also emphasise the crucial importance of patience. \"We need to find a good mixture between commitment and keeping our nerves and discipline,\" he said. \"No stupid fouls, no stupid red cards like what happened before. It is a good opportunity to show we have learnt.\"", "At the risk of sounding unduly pessimistic, it was not entirely easy to follow Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's logic when he started talking us through the reasons why Arsenal could emerge unscathed from two legs against a Barcelona side with haughty credentials to be recognised as the most exquisitely assembled team who ever existed.\n\nArsenal's manager has to strike a positive note but if his team are to stand any chance against Barcelona they will need to find a level of concentration, defensive structure and tactical expertise that has been evident only sporadically during their five-year run of leaving the Champions League at the first knockout stage. Their opponents, Wenger acknowledged, will be \"super favourites\". Arsenal will have to reach the point of maximum expression not just once, but twice, and even then it might still not be enough judging by Wenger's response when he was asked whether Barcelona had any discernible weaknesses. \"Of course,\" he replied. \"No team is perfect.\" And then he paused. \"Though they are not far from it, I must say.\"\n\nIt has certainly been difficult to find too many imperfections during Barcelona's 32-match unbeaten streak, a club record that has seen them accumulate 104 goals and concede only 19, and when it comes to Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\u00e1rez the numbers are so mind-boggling it is tempting to think that getting through to the quarter-finals would qualify as one of the finest achievements in Arsenal's modern era.\n\nBetween them, those three have managed 213 goals since Su\u00e1rez, the player Wenger once tried to lure from Liverpool, signed for Barcelona in the summer of 2014 - 85 for Messi, 66 for Su\u00e1rez and 62 for Neymar - and 91 this season. To put that into perspective, Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck have managed 58 over the same 20-month period - outscored almost four to one.\n\nEven when Wenger thought back to Arsenal's 2-1 victory over Barcelona in 2011, when the sides met at the same stage of the competition, his memory was clouded by the manner in which Pep Guardiola's team turned the game upside down with a 3-1 win in the return leg. \"It's quite funny because the one year we beat them they played us off the park,\" Wenger said.\n\nSo where are the weaknesses? \"That's what we have to show,\" he said. \"Look, you don't win the Champions League by accident. You don't lead La Liga by nine points when Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are both doing well ... that's not a coincidence. Theyare top, top quality. They are the best team in the world, and nobody questions that. But we played Hull on Saturday and it was 0-0. We went to Sheffield Wednesday and lost 3-0. So why can't it be possible the other way around?\"\n\nThe difference is that on both those occasions, in the FA Cup and Capital One Cup, Arsenal handicapped themselves by playing weakened sides and could be accused of not being fully focused, in a way that is rarely said of Bar\u00e7a in big matches. Arsenal can be encouraged by the fact they beat Bayern Munich at home in the group stage (less so by the 5-1 defeat in Bavaria a fortnight later) but it still boils down to the fact that Wenger's team need their opponents to have an off-day. Twice, in fact.\n\nMore than anything, Wenger's instructions will concern not being caught up in the emotion of the tie. He will emphasise there are two legs, reiterating the importance of a clean sheet and avoiding what he described as \"a knife in your heart\" - namely, an away goal. It is not Wenger's way to set up ultra-defensively but there is a necessity to be realistic about the disparity between the teams and plan accordingly.\n\n\"We need a top-level team performance where everybody is spot on with their discipline, sharp physically and ready to work for the team,\" Wenger said. \"Being resilient, having great solidarity and showing intelligence as well. Let's not forget we have a great defensive record. Maybe we were too keen [in previous two-legged Champions League exits] to make the difference in the first game. We have to find the right balance between being audacious, which is what you need to be against Barcelona, but also being a strong defensive unit.\"\n\nWenger's assertion that this was an easier game to manage than the one against Hull might sound preposterous but, in terms of motivation and focus, he makes a valid point. The secret, perhaps, is making sure his players are not too wound up and there was a note of caution when the talk switched to Alexis S\u00e1nchez facing his former club.\n\n\"He will be fired up, but that doesn't mean he will be in the right zone,\" Wenger said. \"The performance zone is where you are focused and relaxed. And that is what is difficult in sport. Sometimes when you are too focused you are not relaxed. It's a zone where everything looks easy, and sometimes when you play against your former club you are not necessarily in that zone.\" Asked if he would need to have a word with S\u00e1nchez before the match, he replied: \"A little one.\"\n\nWenger sounded confident. The trouble is lots of managers come across that way before these fixtures and invariably when the opposition is Barcelona it ends with the same result. The mind goes back to last season and the way Manuel Pellegrini and his Manchester City players bravely talked about fancying their chances. Then the whistle blew and Messi, Neymar et al lined up to take turns nutmegging James Milner and Fernandinho. For Arsenal, the reality is they, too, might simply be outplayed. \"It can happen,\" Wenger admitted.\n\nSix years have passed since Arsenal last won a two-leg knockout tie in the Champions League - and their manager will not need reminding that it was followed in the quarter-finals by a 6-3 aggregate defeat to Barcelona.", "Manchester United's Louis van Gaal admits that the club he has managed for almost two years no longer strikes fear into opposition teams.\n\nVan Gaal's admission that the club no longer strikes fear into opposing teams, further undermines the prestige of the self-styled \"biggest club in the world\", casts additional doubt on Van Gaal's tenure at Old Trafford and is particularly pertinent given that United's next two games are against teams they would previously have expected to swat away.\n\nTonight they visit League One Shrewsbury in a potential banana-skin fifth-round FA Cup tie - with the winners at home to West Ham in the next round - and on Thursday they face the return leg of their Europa League clash against Danish minnows Midtjylland, with United looking to overturn a 2-1 first-leg defeat.\n\nBoth opponents will be hoping to prove Van Gaal's assertion.\n\nAsked if United no longer benefited from the fear factor, the Dutchman confessed: \"When you see the last two games (defeats to Sunderland and Midtjylland) it is maybe like that.\"\n\nTrying to remain positive, he added: \"We have to make teams fear us again. We lost my first home game - against Swansea City - and people said the same but we recovered and we ended last season with a very good home record.\n\n\"We can do that again, but it is a question of winning matches in a row now.\"\n\nWith 14 players injured or ill and three matches to come in a week - United also play Arsenal at home in the Premier League next Sunday - getting any kind of run together will be difficult.\n\nVan Gaal said he expected Shrewsbury to adopt the same tactics that proved so successful for Midtjylland.\n\n\"I have told the players already it will be difficult to bounce back because you cannot continue losing,\" he said. \"The question is how we can lift ourselves for the FA Cup because Shrewsbury will also fight for second balls and play direct and we have to cope.\n\n\"But we also have to keep the ball better and not give away unnecessary goals, because Midtjylland's first was unnecessary and we could have won that duel much more easily for their second goal.\"\n\nWhen asked if he thought Shrewsbury might actually be overconfident when taking on United tonight, Van Gaal replied: \"I hope so because then it is a benefit for us.\"\n\nShrewsbury manager Mellon has sympathy for his opposite number.\n\nHe said: \"When you're a manager, you understand that at certain times you're on your own. There are decisions that have got to be made and you will be held accountable for that and that's me at Fleetwood and Barnsley and Shrewsbury.\n\n\"At Manchester United, if Louis van Gaal blinks the world is looking at it and thinking, 'Was that a proper blink or a twitch?' But he will know that goes with the territory. You don't take the United job if you don't believe that is going to happen.\n\n\"Somebody said to me about the problems they've got and I said, 'I wish I had Manchester United's problems'.\"\n\nMellon, whose Shrews side are the lowest-ranked team left in the FA Cup, insisted ex-Bayern Munich and Barcelona coach Van Gaal remained one of the best in the world, despite his struggles in Manchester.\n\nHe added: \"Look at his CV. It's ridiculous. Wow. If a lot of managers can do a thousandth of what he's done, you'll have had a great career. What he's doing now is probably using his experiences of what's happened to him before and getting on with the job.\"", "Jadwal bola hari ini di TV pada 24-26 Februari 2016 akan diisi jadwal Liga Champion 2016, jadwal Liga Europa 2016, jadwal Liga Champion Asia (ACL) 2016, jadwal AFC Cup 2016, dan jadwal Bali Island Cup 2016.

Wenger did admit \"it was not the most subtle thing\" they'd ever done, but also hinted there was something more to it. \"The details will maybe come out one day -- maybe not in my book, but somebody else's book.\"\n\nWenger didn't exactly reveal more details of that bid after Arsenal's 0-0 draw with Hull City in the FA Cup on Saturday, but he did surprisingly reveal some of his thinking after it. The 66-year-old said that for quite a while after, he wondered \"what if\" regarding Suarez.\n\n\"It happened to me before, but not now.\"\n\nGiven Suarez' sensational effect on an inferior Liverpool squad in that 2013-14 season, it might well have lifted Arsenal to the league title. Instead, they are hopeful of finally ending that waitt this season and the outcome of that 2013 saga might yet have an indirect influence -- it might also condition Tuesday night's Champions League match with Barcelona.\n\nArsenal did not end up with Suarez but they did get with the best possible solution in the circumstances. The Uruguayan went to Barcelona, freeing Alexis Sanchez to go to the Emirates. All involved (except Liverpool) immediately went up another level: Suarez, the Catalans, the Chilean and Arsenal.\n\nIt is funny how football can work out and equally amusing how things like that can spin around. Take Wenger's very opinion on Suarez. It is so counter-intuitively clever. Because of the Uruguayan's history of controversy and trouble, an easy conclusion would be that he is bad news for a team and not worth the hassle. Wenger takes the opposite view. He believes Suarez is well worth the hassle because far from causing issues that can affect a camp, he feels the Uruguayan has qualities that bring a squad closer together.\n\n\"Camaraderie,\" the Arsenal manager said, eventually finding the word for which he had been searching. \"I believe Suarez gives that to a team. He did it at Liverpool, he did it playing with [Edinson] Cavani and [Diego] Forlan and did it well. Suarez is the kind of guy who manages to create that spirit in teams.\"\n\nWenger's rationale is that the Uruguayan's industry and willingness to run are infectious. His work rate and relentless drive bring out more in his teammates. It happened at Liverpool, it might have happened at Arsenal and it's definitely happened at Barcelona. Far from getting in each other's way as many had expressed concern beforehand, the trio of Neymar, Suarez and Messi have worked together so brilliantly. They have complemented each other so brilliantly and been so committed to each other. They now look the perfect fit.\n\nThere's just so much more life to Barca's attack than there was 2013-14 when it was Neymar, Messi and Sanchez. That might reflect badly on the Chilean and his standard at this level, except there is obviously so much more to it than that. The reality is that he has enjoyed so much more life to his game since joining Arsenal, too.\n\nFor much of his time at Barcelona, Sanchez didn't get to fully express his fierce vibrancy. He often looked little more than a mere finisher or functional worker serving Messi, with little in between to tie those two strands of his game, an obvious contrast to his enthusiastic play at Udinese before moving to the Camp Nou in 2011. It was a spell of form that reached a nadir under Tata Martino, whose management seemed to make their entire attack look so flat, with Messi himself also more restrained and not as fit.\n\nSanchez has since recovered his rampaging old self. He hasn't been so constrained and that sense of release could be the key to Arsenal's chances of pulling off an improbable win against what Wenger has wondered might be the most impressive team in history.\n\nThe 66-year-old Wenger has naturally admitted that they won't have much of the ball and must snap at any opportunities. He hastened to liken it to the home win over Bayern Munich in the group stage, but it will still probably come down to Arsenal having to be especially fast and ruthless with any sudden breaks they get.\n\nAs that match earlier in the season emphatically proved, Sanchez is perfect for that mode of play. It's almost ideal for the Chilean when he's able to suddenly run into space with such clarity of intent. It can also mitigate the effect of Barcelona's attack -- they might have to be a little more reticent in going forward so Mesut Ozil does not have quite so much space in behind to unleash one of Arsenal's runners in an instant.\n\nThe one lingering issue is that unlike Suarez and the rest of Barca's attack, Sanchez has not quite looked so fit of late and was rusty in the 0-0 draw against Hull. But Wenger isn't concerned.\n\n\"I don't think he was completely ready to come on. It looked like that but he grows with the game does Sanchez. He has a game based on risk and so when he's not completely, highly tuned in it becomes dangerous.\n\n\"Don't worry about Tuesday, he'll be tuned in.\"\n\nThe entire Arsenal team will need to be tuned in if they are to combat Suarez and his attacking teammates, and potentially see this game work out in a different way than everyone expects. Against a forward line like that, Sanchez and his team will likely to have to put in one of their best pound-for-pound performances.", "Tuesday night will play host to arguably the standout tie of the Champions League last 16 as the 2014-15 runners-up Juventus host Bayern Munich in the first leg.\n\nThe two sides are among the most in-form teams in European football right now and have reached the final of this competition 18 times between them.\n\nJuventus\u00a9 Getty Images\n\nHaving dominated Italian football in recent years, winning the Serie A title in each of the last four seasons, Juventus are beginning to re-establish themselves as one of the best teams in Europe too.\n\nThe Old Lady made it all the way to the final last term having already clinched a league and cup double, but they were pipped to the post by Barcelona, who were chasing a treble of their own.\n\nThere appeared to be no hangover from that defeat, at least in Europe, when Juve opened the group stage with victory over Manchester City at the Etihad, before going on to remain unbeaten throughout their opening five games of this season's campaign.\n\nHowever, a loss to Sevilla on the final matchday saw them surrender top spot to City, and they have subsequently been handed one of the trickiest ties that they could have got having made it through to the knockout stages in consecutive seasons for the first time in a decade.\n\nIn truth, their group-stage record will not exactly fill Bayern with fear. They managed just six goals on their way to the knockout phase, which was not only the lowest tally of any team to reach the last 16, but also the lowest tally in Group D itself.\n\nFortunately for Massimiliano Allegri's side, they boast one of the meanest defensive records in Europe over the past few months and go into Tuesday's match on a run of nine consecutive clean sheets. Making it 10 in a row, and preventing Bayern from getting an away goal, could be crucial to their chances of reaching the quarter-finals.\n\nThings didn't start too well for Juve this season in terms of domestic action, with just one win from their first six Serie A games leaving the champions languishing in the bottom half of the table.\n\nHowever, they have been in phenomenal form since the end of October, stringing together a club-record 15-match winning streak in the league to race up the table and eventually overhaul Napoli at the top, where they now have a one-point gap and look to be on course for a fifth consecutive title.\n\nThe long winning streak, which also stood at 13 games in all competitions, came to an end on Friday night, though, as Juventus were held to a goalless draw by Bologna in a game that saw Paul Pogba miss the most presentable chances.\n\nAt home, though, their run goes on. They have won their last 11 games at the Juventus Stadium, conceding just two goals in that time and none since December 13, while their unbeaten home record in all competitions currently stands at 16.\n\nIn Europe they have only lost two of their last 45 home games going back to the start of the 2004-05 season, although both of those defeats did come at the hands of Bayern, who are the only foreign side to have ever won at the Juventus Stadium.\n\nRecent form: WWDDWL\n\nRecent form (all competitions): WWWWWD\n\nBayern Munich\u00a9 Getty Images\n\nThere can be many parallels drawn between Juventus and Bayern Munich, both this season and in recent campaigns.\n\nBoth have dominated domestically, with Bayern having won the Bundesliga title in each of the last three seasons and looking good for a fourth with an eight-point lead at the top of the table.\n\nBoth come into this match in formidable form too. Bayern, like Juventus, have not been beaten in any competition since early December and the two sides have an identical record of nine wins and one draw from their last 10 outings.\n\nThe key difference, however, comes in the success of Bayern on the European stage. While Juventus have not won Europe's highest club honour since 1996, Bayern were able to complete the treble in 2013 and have reached at least the semi-finals in five of the last six seasons.\n\nThe accolade of being the best club in Europe is not one that has been bestowed upon the club under the tenure of Pep Guardiola so far, though, and the Spaniard may view his time at the Allianz Arena as incomplete if he is unable to rectify that this season.\n\nWith a move to Manchester City at the end of the current campaign, time is running out for Guardiola to take Bayern to the heights of his predecessor Jupp Heynckes, who left the club having steered them to an unprecedented treble.\n\nIt is, of course, no mean feat to win the Champions League, and Guardiola is looking to join a select group of just two other managers - Bob Paisley and his Bayern successor Carlo Ancelotti - in winning the competition three times.\n\nHowever, such are the standards that he has set during his relatively short managerial career so far that failure to lift Europe's biggest prize having taken over with the club as the best team on the continent would be seen as something of a black mark on his impeccable record.\n\nHe certainly has the players to emulate Heynckes and leave at the top, though, with Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller having combined to score 56 goals between them this season, including 12 in the Champions League - twice as many as Juventus' entire squad have managed.\n\nLewandowski alone beats the Old Lady's tally of Champions League goals this season and has 30 in all since making his debut in the competition in 2011-12 - a tally only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi can beat in the same timeframe. So far this season, the Poland international has 40 goals in 37 appearances for club and country.\n\nBayern have, however, failed to win any of their last five away games in the knockout stages of this competition and will need to become the first visiting side to score a Champions League goal at the Juventus Stadium this season if that record is going to change.\n\nRecent form: WWLWWW\n\nRecent form (all competitions): WWDWWW\n\nTeam News\u00a9 Getty Images\n\nStriker Mario Mandzukic scored 39 goals in 74 appearances during a two-year stint with Bayern, including one in the 2013 Champions League final, but he is unlikely to be fit in time to face his former club having been sidelined for almost a month with a thigh injury.\n\nGiorgio Chiellini is expected to be another high-profile absentee for the hosts due to a calf problem, while Alex Sandro (thigh) is also likely to miss out.\n\nBayern, meanwhile, gave a welcome return to winger Franck Ribery at the weekend following a long-term thigh injury, although Guardiola may be cautious of throwing the Frenchman straight into the starting XI for such a big game.\n\nMario Gotze was also in the squad for the come-from-behind victory over Darmstadt, but he too is lacking match practice having not played since early October.\n\nBoth are expected to be involved at some stage of the encounter, but Bayern will be without Jerome Boateng (groin), Javi Martinez (knee) and Holger Badstuber (ankle) for the match.\n\nArturo Vidal and Kingsley Coman return to Turin having left Juve for Bayern last summer, with the former having made 157 appearances and won four Serie A titles with the Bianconeri.\n\nJuventus possible starting lineup:\n\nBuffon; Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Barzagli, Evra; Cuadrado, Khedira, Marchisio, Pogba; Dybala, Morata\n\nBayern possible starting lineup:\n\nNeuer; Lahm, Kimmich, Alaba, Bernat; Robben, Vidal, Thiago, Costa; Muller; Lewandowski\n\nHead To Head\n\nThese two sides have only met once before in the knockout stages of the Champions League, with Bayern winning 2-0 in both legs of the 2012-13 quarter-final on their way to lifting the trophy.\n\nBayern have won the last three and are unbeaten in the last four meetings between the two teams in this competition, with Juve's most recent victory coming in November 2005 when David Trezeguet notched a brace in a 2-1 win.\n\nJuventus have won 14 of their previous 22 home matches against German opposition (D3 L5), while Bayern have won seven, drawn three and lost nine of their 19 games in Italy (W4 D1 L5 in knockout ties).\n\nThe Dugout Podcast\n\nHit play below to listen to Sports Mole's new podcast 'The Dugout' for our take on the week's biggest football talking points:\n\nWe say: Juventus 2-1 Bayern Munich\n\nThis is a mouth-watering clash between two giants of European football, both of whom are in magnificent form. Bayern's away record in the Champions League is surprisingly poor under Guardiola, but they have the quality to breach the stern Juve defence and clinch an away goal. We're picking the hosts to win on the night, but Bayern to very much stay in the tie ahead of next month's second leg in Munich.", "Tuesday night is the sort of Champions League evening to both delight and frustrate. On the one hand there are two brilliant matches to watch, but on the other... well, there are two brilliant matches to watch.\n\nHow does one choose between Arsenal against Barcelona and Juventus vs. Bayern Munich? The answer might well be \"with a heavy heart\" but while London will undoubtedly see an exceptional team face a very good one, surely the best contest will come in Turin, where two of Europe's giants face each other.\n\nSomething extraordinary happened on Friday evening. Something that hasn't been seen in months and at times looked like it would never happen again: Juventus didn't win a match. Granted, this was a game in which Max Allegri's were without a few key players, including the dazzling Paulo Dybala (rested), Sami Khedira (left out in what sounds like a precautionary measure) and Alex Sandro (injured), and it was against a Bologna team who were brilliantly organised, as they have frequently been under new boss Roberto Donadoni, but this was nonetheless a rare occurrence.\n\n\"You can't win all the time in football,\" said Allegri after the game. \"These lads have been working so hard for three months and a hiccup can happen.\"\n\nThat 0-0 draw represented the end of a 15-game winning run in Serie A that took Juventus from a shaky start to the top of the table. The last time they lost in the league was in October to Sassuolo; if you throw in a few Coppa Italia games they had won 18 domestic matches in a row and if you include the Champions League, they had lost just one of their previous 21, that a meaningless group game against Sevilla.\n\nAllegri's team are in fine form but so too are Bayern. It says something when Pep Guardiola's team merely conceding a goal raises eyebrows, but that's what happened when they went 1-0 down to Darmstadt on Saturday, a state of affairs that lasted a full 23 minutes before Thomas Muller, and then Robert Lewandowski, ensured normal service resumed.\n\nThat was just the fourth time Bayern have even trailed all season; in fact, in 32 games in all competitions so far, they have been behind for a total of just 122 minutes. The two games they have lost, against Borussia Monchengladbach in the Bundesliga and Arsenal in the Champions League, are extreme outliers. With two teams this strong, you could think of Tuesday's game as being the irresistible force meeting the other irresistible force.\n\nYet while both teams are in fine shape in terms of results, one has an injury list that would be ruinous for many clubs.\n\nBayern currently have an entire back four (and a pretty good one too) sidelined with various ailments; Holger Badstuber is the latest to join Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez on the sidelines, with Mehdi Benatia having only just returned to full training having last played in December.\n\nThrowing Benatia in against Juve would represent quite a gamble but then again, most other central defensive solutions would be similarly risky. Serdar Tasci has only played once since arriving from Spartak Moscow, Joshua Kimmich (who partnered Tasci at the weekend) and Xabi Alonso are midfielders by trade while David Alaba can play in many positions but is best used elsewhere. Guardiola has succeeded when picking the bare minimum of specialist defenders before but against a Juventus side that usually find a way through the most stubborn of defences, they could struggle to keep things tight.\n\nInterestingly, Bayern have emphasised Juve's attacking threat in the build-up to this game, with both David Alaba and Xabi Alonso remarking on how wary the Germans will have to be from set-pieces. This might well be something for them to be aware of, although Juventus have scored a relatively modest six league goals from set-pieces this season. Still, if Bayern are forced to play a makeshift back line, that threat will increase. With this in mind, one wonders if Allegri will be tempted to start Mario Mandzukic against his former team.\n\nWhat will be interesting is the system Allegri chooses to face Bayern. For much of the season he has favoured the three-man back line and wing-backs generally more concerned with attack than defence but in the past few games, Juve have played with four at the back. One reason for that shift could be the injury to Sandro, meaning that 34-year-old Patrice Evra has required a more defined and defensive role, but Allegri hasn't been wedded to that formation this term.\n\nGiven the pace Bayern have on the flanks, the likes of Douglas Costa, Franck Ribery, Kingsley Coman or Arjen Robben likely to gobble up any space left by wing-backs, a four-man defence might be the most prudent set-up regardless of which left-sided players are available. The absence of Giorgio Chiellini, who balances out a three-man defence nicely, will also be a factor.\n\n\"It would be important for us to score an away goal but Juve have a very strong defence and it's up to us to play with intelligence,\" said Guardiola on Monday. \"We'll try to win the first leg and then control the second. Compared to last season we have a much bigger squad with men who can take players on. Of course, so do Juve.\"\n\nOf their last 45 European games at home, Juventus have only lost two. They were both to Bayern. Finding out whether Guardiola's men will make it three should make for a highly entertaining evening.", "Manchester City may have appointed Pep Guardiola as their manager from next season, but according to Barcelona's president, they are not trying to replicate the Catalan club.\n\nGuardiola won 14 major titles in four seasons in charge of Barcelona, stepping up from coaching the B side of the club he represented with distinction as a player.\n\nHe has since gone on to enjoy further success with Bayern Munich but his work with Barca remains his stand-out, with many thinking City have plumped for him in a bid to copy the La Liga champions' distinctive style of play.\n\nThey also have ex-Barca staff Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain on their books, but president Josep Maria Bartomeu does not agree that they are trying to become an incarnation of his club.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I don't think City are replicating anything.

He was seen as a shoo-in for the job, until he, like Blatter, was sanctioned by the FIFA ethics committee for accepting a \"disloyal\" payment of around $2 million from - guess who? - Sepp Blatter.\n\nPlatini maintains his innocence and awaits word of his appeal to FIFA, which could happen at any moment. Most believe the appeals committee, which met with him last week, will decline to clear him.\n\nAnd in case you might believe that Platini's wish to run under a cloud of corruption is a singular bit of hubris, consider that FIFA's powerful number two, Jerome Valcke - recently banned from all soccer-related activities for 12 years by the same ethics committee - was also considering a run to replace his former boss!\n\nThen there were those who wanted to run but were disqualified by FIFA specifically from doing so. Liberia's Musa Bility failed FIFA's own \"integrity\" test - which we can only speculate how rigorous that may or, more likely, may not be.\n\nAnd former FIFA vice president Chung Mong-joon of South Korea was banned for six years by the group's ethics committee after being found guilty of illegal wrongdoings during bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\n\nBoth Bility and Chung deny the allegations.\n\nNow to the five candidates who have been permitted by FIFA to run - and if that sounds a bit like Iranian elections, where candidates have to be approved by the Ayatollah, you aren't alone. All five are fairly unappealing.\n\nThere's Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, who is the president of Asia's governing soccer body, AFC, as well as a member of FIFA's executive committee. The member of Bahrain's royal family is favored by FIFA insiders.\n\nThe fly in the ointment is human rights. Non-governmental groups have accused Sheikh Salman of torture and false imprisonment of athletes who marched for democracy in Bahrain during the 2011 protests.\n\n\"FIFA is putting a noose around its neck if it elects Salman to lead world soccer,\" a spokesman from the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy said, according to England's Sun newspaper.\n\nWhile he has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, having this hang over his head is troubling no matter which way you look at it.\n\nAnother favorite for the position is Swiss national Gianni Infantino, who, as the number two at UEFA, replaced his boss Platini. Ifantino's big idea is that he'll raise the World Cup to a whopping 40 teams - could that be a play for votes from the smaller countries? A lawyer by training, Infantino certainly has a chance.\n\nThe list is rounded out by candidates Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan, former deputy general secretary of FIFA Jerome Champagne and South African businessman Tokyo Sexwale.\n\nThe vote is designed in a way that only leads to horse-trading and promises being made to blocs of countries. The historical problem, of course, is that candidates are automatically shackled by such promises.\n\nAs radical a proposal as it is, I think the only way forward for the organization is to start afresh.\n\nLet's have a new FIFA Executive Council made up of 12 former players and coaches and let them decide who leads world soccer.\n\nCertainly a better starting point than anything else that's out there.\n\nThey couldn't possibly come up with anything worse than what's already in place.\n\nVideo of the week\n\nWatch as Bayern Munich's Thomas Mueller scores this cracker against opponents Darmstadt during a German Bundesliga game this weekend.\n\nFrom the wires\n\nFIFA presidential candidate Jerome Champagne made a formal complaint claiming two rivals supported by continental governing bodies will have an unfair advantage at the vote on Friday.\n\nChampagne urged FIFA election monitors on Monday to cancel 20 extra passes for \"observers\" from UEFA and seven for the Asian Football Confederation to enter the election hall in Zurich.\n\nIn a letter seen by the Associated Press, he wrote that UEFA and the AFC plan \"to swamp the Congress hall with confederation employees able to access\" voters.\n\nUEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino and AFC President Sheikh Salman are seen as front-runners in the five-candidate contest.\n\nChampagne, who has run his own campaign, said allowing extra accreditations would \"betray a gross violation of the principle of fairness.\"\n\n\"Moreover, the list of names of the persons benefiting from these accreditations reveals the presence of most of the members of these two candidates' campaign teams,\" wrote the French former diplomat, who was ousted from his job as FIFA international relations director in 2010.\n\nDespite 11 years working as a FIFA insider under Sepp Blatter, Champagne has seemed like an outsider in a campaign that includes two members of Middle East monarchies, a commodities tycoon, and the spending power of wealthy European soccer.\n\nChampagne promised to pursue his complaint against \"these unfair and undue privileges\" if the three-member FIFA election panel did not act by Tuesday.\n\n\"The question of the accreditation is in the hands of FIFA,\" the election committee said in a statement.\n\nPotential breaches of FIFA election rules can be appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nThe vote of up to 209 FIFA member federations on Friday will choose a successor to Blatter, as FIFA aims to renew itself after the biggest corruption crisis in its 112-year history.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBen Evansky is a Fox News Channel field producer, and is a U.S. Youth Soccer qualified coach.

EFE\n\nJuventus will be hosting Bayern Munich on Tuesday in eth first leg of the Champions League's knockout stage. the Italian side has an advantage after recovering the Croatian Mario Mandzukic and the German Sami Khedira from injury, amid defensive setbacks at Bayern.\n\nAlthough Juventus was a finalist in the last edition of the continental championship, it is clear that the powerful Bavarian giant is favorite to qualify to the quarterfinals and even to lift the trophy.", "The first leg of the Champions League round of 16 continues on Tuesday. Here is a statistical look at the four matches this week, complete with Soccer Power Index (SPI) projections.\n\nArsenal vs. Barcelona (Tuesday)\n\nBarcelona are a 79 percent favorite to advance to the quarterfinals, according to SPI, but still had an unlucky draw, as only Juventus or PSG would have been worse of their seven possible opponents. Arsenal, meanwhile, had their worst possible draw, as Bayern Munich were not one of their potential opponents.\n\nFor Arsenal, the key will be whether Mesut Ozil is able to create chances as he has so far in the Premier League this season. Among players in the five major European leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France), Ozil's 105 chances created in league play are 19 more than anyone else, and his 17 assists are 7 more than any other player.\n\nBarcelona have long been a high-scoring team and have been efficient this season as well. The Catalans have scored with 16.8 percent of their overall shots and 40.9 percent of their shots on target in league play this season, both of which are second-best in the five major European leagues.\n\nThis may prove difficult against Petr Cech, however, who leads the Premier League with 12 clean sheets and an 81.3 save percentage (min. 10 matches played).\n\nJuventus vs. Bayern Munich (Tuesday)\n\nBoth teams got their worst possible draw for this round, according to SPI, as Bayern Munich are the highest-rated team in Europe, while Juventus, on the heels of 14 consecutive matches unbeaten in all competitions, are now the highest-rated runner-up. Bayern are a 64 percent favorite to advance, per SPI, and would have been an average of an 86 percent favorite against other possible opponents.\n\nScoring opportunities may be few and far between in this matchup. The Germans have allowed just 17 goals in 33 matches in all competitions this season, allowing multiple goals in a match just twice. The Italians have allowed 18 goals in 36 matches in all competitions and have not allowed more than two goals in a match this season.\n\nA major reason is that opponents do not get many chances. Bayern allow the fewest shots (6.6) and chances created (4.8) per game, and the second-fewest shots on target per game (2.1) among the five major European leagues in league play this season. Juventus rank third, first, and third in those categories, respectively.\n\nPSV vs. Atletico Madrid (Wednesday)\n\nAtletico Madrid are projected to advance 78 percent of the time, according to SPI. Both squads received an average draw. Atletico fell in the middle of PSV's seven possible opponents, while PSV were the third-best possibility for the La Liga club.\n\nLos Colchoneros are one of the top defensive teams in Europe, allowing the fewest goals per match in league play (0.44) in the five major European leagues. In 36 matches in all competitions this season, Diego Simeone's men have conceded more than one goal just four times, and two of those came against Barcelona.\n\nPSV will need to make the most of their chances, and attempt to create more than in the group stage. Among the 16 teams to advance to the knockouts, PSV had the fewest shots, shots on goal and chances created during the group stage.\n\nDynamo Kiev vs. Manchester City (Wednesday)\n\nBoth Manchester City and Dynamo Kiev got their second-best possible draws, with Manchester City projected to advance the quarterfinals 71 percent of the time per SPI. Only Gent would have been a better opponent for City, while only Wolfsburg would have been better for Dynamo.\n\nThe Premier League side will be boosted by the return of Vincent Kompany, who came back to the squad last Sunday against Tottenham after missing 19 of City's previous 20 games due to injury. In the 11 games started by Kompany in all competitions, Manuel Pellegrini's side have conceded just six goals (0.55 per match). In the other 29 matches in which he did not play or came off the bench, they have conceded 41 goals (1.41 per match). In the games started by Kompany, City have allowed opponents 1.8 shots on target per game. In the games he does not start, that rises to 4.25.\n\nWhile Man City's defense will be tough with Kompany back, Kiev will prove difficult to score on as well while playing at home. In 12 matches at home in all competitions this season, Kiev have conceded just six goals, and have kept a clean sheet in nine of those matches.", "GermanyInterview: Rafinha Talks Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola and Bastian Schweinsteiger\n\nFollow @insidefutbol\n\nArsenal striker Olivier Giroud feels there is no reason why his side cannot beat Champions League holders Barcelona at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Gunners come up against the reigning champions at home for the first leg of their round of 16 clash, looking to take an advantage into the second leg in Spain.\n\nThe Catalan giants are on a 32-match unbeaten run in all competitions going into the match.\n\nArsene Wenger's side progressed to the knockout round with a heroic display in the group stages, which saw them qualify despite losing the first two matches.\n\nThe Gunners last came up against the Bluagrana in round of 16 of the Champions League in 2010/11, when Arsenal were knocked out after suffering a 4-3 defeat following the controversial sending off of Robin van Persie.", "Luis Enrique could be excused an air of quiet, or even not-so-quiet, confidence before Tuesday's Champions League first leg against Arsenal at the Emirates. As Barcelona's manager batted aside the usual swooning questions about the intangible chemistry of his own front three, exactly how he conjures those moments of splendour (\"I tell them 'abracadabra' and the magic sparks sparks, that's all I do\") there was at times a detached sense of pride, an objective appreciation of the merits of his own world champion team from a manager well aware of his own place in all this, curator of some uniquely brilliant attacking talents.\n\n\"It's not only great we are here in London playing Arsenal but also for the magnitude of the Champions League league itself,\" he said. Asked to respond to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's insistence Bar\u00e7a were huge favourites in the tie Luis Enrique even stopped short of the standard-issue denial, noting instead that \"it's kind of logical\".\n\n\"Our target is to win the game no matter what. So we need to score goals no matter what. Barcelona always has the possession of the ball and controls the game, so on paper this is one of he most attractive and appealing games. I think we're going to witness a very good game because both want to dominate.\"\n\nOpen football, a toe-to-toe battle for control of the ball, mastery of space: for Arsenal's supporters it is hard to imagine a more nerve-shredding approach to eliminating the world club champions. For all Luis Enrique's pointed optimism, the reality may well be a little different. In the last five years there has been a slightly gruelling familiarity to meetings between these teams, with Arsenal yet to win a match of any substance despite some periods of fine football along exactly these lines. This time around the gap between them seems as large as it ever has. A vast quivering acreage of laudatory pre-match analysis has already been devoted both to the Messi-Su\u00e1rez-Neymar attacking trident and to that annihilating run of results since the autumn.\n\nThose stats again, then. Barcelona have not lost for 32 games, since 3 October last year. In the same period Arsenal have lost to Southampton, West Brom, Chelsea, Sheffield Wednesday and Bayern Munich. Barcelona's front three have each scored more goals individually this year than the Arsenal have in total. Barcelona have 23 goals in their last seven games, Arsenal six in the same period. Arsenal's all-time top scorers in this competition are Tomas Rosicky and Theo Walcott with 11 goals apiece. Both have some way to go to catch Messi, who has 80 and counting.\n\nAnd yet part of the charm of this Barcelona side is that they have weaknesses too. One question Luis Enrique would not answer concerned his refusal to rotate his team in recent weeks despite a suspicion fatigue might yet become an issue. For once on these occasions an English club has no cause to complain of being overburdened with domestic fixtures. Barcelona come to the Emirates having played 16 games since the end of Spain's brief winter break: Arsenal have played 10 in the same period. The idea Bar\u00e7a simply need to stroll into town to take the points in La Liga is also something of a myth, as witnessed by this weekend's messy, hard-fought 2-1 win at Las Palmas.\n\nNo doubt Bar\u00e7a's high-technique style helps, the ability to cosset the ball and suck the life out of opponents, which is perhaps also reflected in Barcelona's almost non-existent injury list (only Rafinha is injured for this game). \"Having those three makes you really proud,\" was Ivan Rakitic's response to the suggestion a rest may be in order for the Big Three. \"I wouldn't say they never want to stop playing, but they wouldn't like it that much. They are like children playing football, it would be like taking the ball away from them. Those three players make us a different team.\"\n\nRakitic also dismissed the suggestion Bar\u00e7a may be tempted to go for broke and kill this tie in the first leg, as was the habit in their run to the final last year. \"We would like to but we cannot think about that. We must know what we have to do and if we get a good score that will be fantastic but we will be very confident for the second leg.\"\n\nIt is an intriguing point of contrast given Arsenal's own tendency to do exactly the opposite and collapse at the first knockout hurdle. Simply failing to lose the tie outright in the opening 90 minutes would represent a vast improvement for a team who have become dreadful, fearful, fretful starters, failing to win the first leg of any European knockout tie since 2009.\n\nTo stick or to twist will be the key question for Wenger. Simply scoring the opening goal would represent something of a revolution at this stage, albeit pushing too hard to do so against this opposition could prove fatal in itself The strength of Barcelona's attack, the temptation simply to stay in the tie, to try to shut down rather than contest as a duel of wits the spaces this Barcelona team like to break from, may make for a more cautious affair.\n\nAs Luis Enrique noted, a little ominously: \"I have seen Arsenal this season and they are going to press high at some points in the game and I hope we can keep possession in their half of the pitch and put our football into practice\".", "BC-SOC--German Standings\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nPublished: 21:22 GMT, 22 February 2016 | Updated: 21:22 GMT, 22 February 2016\n\nEintracht Frankfurt 0, Hamburger SV 0\n\nHoffenheim 3, Mainz 2\n\nBayern Munich 3, Darmstadt 1\n\nFC Ingolstadt 04 2, Werder Bremen 0\n\nHertha BSC Berlin 1, Wolfsburg 1\n\nBorussia Moenchengladbach 1, FC Koln 0\n\nBayer Leverkusen 0, Borussia Dortmund 1\n\nSchalke 1, Stuttgart 1\n\nHannover 0, Augsburg 1\n\nFC Koln vs. Hertha BSC Berlin, 1930 GMT\n\nHamburger SV vs. FC Ingolstadt 04, 1430 GMT\n\nStuttgart vs. Hannover, 1430 GMT\n\nWolfsburg vs. Bayern Munich, 1430 GMT\n\nWerder Bremen vs. Darmstadt, 1430 GMT\n\nAugsburg vs. Borussia Moenchengladbach, 1430 GMT\n\nBorussia Dortmund vs. Hoffenheim, 1630 GMT\n\nMainz vs. Bayer Leverkusen, 1630 GMT\n\nEintracht Frankfurt vs. Schalke, 1830 GMT\n\na-penalized 3 points\n\nSt. Pauli 1, FSV Frankfurt 3\n\nRB Leipzig 3, Union Berlin 0\n\nSpVgg Greuther Furth 1, Duisberg 1\n\nKaiserslautern 2, Heidenheim 2\n\nKarlsruher SC 2, Eintracht Braunschweig 2\n\nArminia Bielefeld 1, Paderborn 1\n\nSandhausen 0, SC Freiburg 2\n\n1860 Munich 1, Bochum 1\n\nFortuna Duesseldorf 1, 1.

The Manchester club are understood to be preparing a \u00a360 million bid to entice him away from Germany in an attempt to improve their recent failures in front of goal.\n\nThe Red Devils' interest in M\u00fcller has widely been reported since the previous summer's transfer window, including a rejected \u00a378 million bid that would have broken yet another club and league record. Despite recently signing a new 5 year contract to keep him at Bayern until 2021, as well as Bayern sporting director Matthias Sammer's persistence that M\u00fcller will never be sold, rumours continue to circulate.", "REUTERS: Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola is determined to win the Champions League for a third time but will not be judged a failure even if he leaves at the end of the season without lifting Europe's biggest prize again.\n\nBayern's all-conquering Spaniard faces a tough examination of his brilliance when he leads the injury-hit German champions against a Juventus side boasting one of Europe's meanest defences in the last-16 first leg clash in Turin on Tuesday.\n\nYet asked in a pre-match news conference on Monday whether it would be a failure if he finished his three-season Bayern spell without having won the trophy, the Manchester City-bound coach responded that there was more to life than football.\n\n\"Anyone who judges me only for the Champions League doesn't realise my life does not depend on that,\" he told reporters. \"I want to win the Champions League too, but I have found a new culture (in Munich) and my objectives have been achieved.\n\n\"At Barcelona, I won everything and won it again.

Barca, humiliated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals, were in their post-Pep Guardiola re-build and finalising a deal for Neymar. Suarez was not on their radar.\n\nLikewise, Real Madrid, touted as a possible Suarez destination, were desperately trying to sign Gareth Bale.\n\nSuarez has since admitted that while Arsenal was never his dream destination, he would probably have taken it - believing Barcelona was a mere pipe dream.\n\nEven Rodgers admitted Suarez had his price. And an Arsenal bid of \u00a350m would probably have succeeded.\n\nWenger did go high-end that summer by signing Mesut Ozil, then adding Alexis Sanchez 12 months later. Yet a world-class centre-forward has never arrived.\n\nWith his sublime movement and positional instinct, Suarez is and was every inch a Wenger player.\n\nSuarez, Sanchez and Ozil might even have been the basis for a Champions League winning side. Certainly one capable of looking Barcelona in the eye and playing them at their own game.\n\nInstead, Suarez took Liverpool closer to the league title than Arsenal have managed in a decade and has now netted 41 times in 37 matches this season.\n\nWhen Arsenal played the Catalans a few years back, they were frequently described as 'Barca Lite'. Now they are not even that.\n\nDespite modest progress since 2013, Arsenal are no longer playing the same game as Barcelona.

Part of the justification for the price comes down to a trick water injection system that blows from the car's butt up its nose.\n\nThis new EVO video gives a full walkaround of the 493 horsepower car, but the interesting part focuses on the water injection system.\n\nWater injection has been pretty common in the hot rodding side of the car universe for ages. It came over from World War II fighter jets and works on a pretty simple idea.\n\nInject water into the combustion chamber, and as the gas ignites it evaporates the water. Much in the way that sweating works, that evaporation cools everything down. Cooler combustion temperatures mean you can run lower octane fuels, higher compression, more boost, all without knocking. Cooler combustion means you can get an engine to make more power, basically.\n\nWe discussed this when the car came out, but I'd never seen elsewhere that the water reservoir is mounted in the trunk. You lift up the carpet and there's your filler cap.\n\nI don't know if this really works in justifying the car's price tag, but it's cool to see BMW now using hot rod tricks from back in the day on their fastest car ever.", "Earlier today, Autoweek.nl showed leaked images of the production-ready Maserati Levante prior to its debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Apparently, that leak has spurred Maserati to get out in front of the story as the Italian luxury brand has taken to Twitter to reveal the Levante under its own terms.\n\nDON'T MISS: 2016 BMW M2 First Drive\n\nThe images confirm that the earlier leak did indeed show the production-intent SUV. The design is not the same as the Kubang concept from the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show. The front is features a bold version of the brand's corporate grille, with cat's eye headlights, a large lower air intake, and, yes, portholes on the front fenders. The strong rear haunches flow into a rear end that mixes elements of the Porsche Cayenne and Alfa Romeo Giulia.\n\nUnfortunately, no other news has been announced.

Power and Associates.\n\nMillennials, or those born between 1980 and 2000, have been labeled as apathetic about car buying in the past. Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft have made it easier not to own a car. But now these assumptions are being debunked.\n\nAs the largest population in the U.S. today, according to data from the Census Bureau, millennials have a big impact on the economy.\n\nBill Olive, general manager of O'Steen Volkswagen on Philips Highway, has seen that here in Jacksonville. He said more than half of O'Steen's business is going to millennials.\n\n\"Millennials want a car that gives performance but is also economical,\" Olive said, \"50-year-olds are more worried about comfort and technology rather than gas mileage.\"\n\nHe said the Volkswagen Golf has been popular among young men, while the Jetta has more of a female following. Both models have base prices under $19,000.\n\nMadison Davell, a senior at the University of North Florida, is a Jetta driver. After graduating, she plans to move out West and buy a Subaru to replace her 2009 VW.\n\n\"I want a Subaru because they're reliable, \" Davell said. \"They have off-road ability and versatility so there's lots of space to load camping and skiing gear into.\"\n\nAnd Davell isn't the only one looking for something trustworthy. Vehicle reliability is a top consideration for young buyers, according to J.D. Power.\n\nAlice Maule, 22, bought her Jeep Patriot new three years ago and plans to have it for the long haul.\n\n\"My car is paid for, so I plan to drive it until it breaks down on a hot desert highway -- hopefully eight to 10 years from now,\" Maule said.\n\nOlive said there's even a difference between what older millennials and their younger peers want. He said younger consumers are buying, while the older ones are leasing.\n\n\"They're 28 to 35 and have a family; they're going to want more car and more car for their dollars,\" Olive said.\n\nChady Boady, 27, bought his 2013 Toyota Tacoma new. With only 36,000 miles on it, he plans to have it for at least the next 10 years. After that, he's not sure what he wants.\n\n\"10 years from now, things may be different. I don't know,'' Boady said. \"I may have children; I may have to get a bigger vehicle, but I think this is the best truck.\n\nBoady said he might go to the Jacksonville International Auto Show that closes its three-day run at the Prime Osborn Convention Center on Sunday -- especially with the largest number of automakers participating in the \"Ride and Drive\" event. Some 30 cars, SUVs and trucks will be available from Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Fiat, Buick, Chevrolet, GMC, Honda and Toyota.\n\nCar preferences across the ages aren't the only thing contrasting. Forbes found millennials aren't influenced by advertising as much as they are by social media and blogs, while the older generation still relies on print ads when making their choice.\n\nJake Sydorowicz, vice president and general manager of World Imports USA and Lotus of Jacksonville on Beach Boulevard, said the Internet has made a huge impact on the auto industry.\n\n\"Every buyer goes on cars.com and autotrader.com,\" Sydorowicz said, \"But I think that generation [millennial] goes the next step; they check forums and independent reviews.\"\n\nSydorowicz said millennials already know what they want before they even come to the dealership.\n\n\"The younger generation predetermines what they want before they drive it,\" Sydorowicz said.\n\nWorld Imports, now celebrating its 30th anniversary, specializes in late-model BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo vehicles, but also sells brands like Ford and Acura.\n\nWhen shopping for cars, younger consumers are also looking for features like navigation, Bluetooth and satellite radio, according to autotrader.com.\n\nSydorowicz echoed that finding, saying navigation is the number one feature people are looking for.\n\n\"People act as if a car doesn't have nav [navigation], they can't drive it anymore,\" Sydorowicz said.\n\nRegardless of generation, research shows new technology and better gas mileage will fuel the future of the car industry.\n\n\"From a core standpoint, people are the same,\" Sydorowicz said, \"They get excited when they buy a car.\"", "Folks check out this rare Daimler SP250 at last Saturday's Cars and Coffee. The sports car was built by the Daimler Company, a British manufacturer in Coventry, from 1959 to 1964.

Yes, you read that correctly: Cars that came out at the same time as Point Break and REM's Losing My Religion are classics, according to the U.S. legislature and the Antique Automobile Club of America. Recently, the folks over at Hagerty Insurance put together a short list of some of those cars that have now inherited classic status, however, we don't think they included many of our top picks. Likewise, some of Hagerty's picks aren't exactly what we'd call classics to that we desire -- Buick Roadmaster, Dodge Spirit, Ford Explorer? -- so here is our revised list. Acura NSX To Hagerty's credit, the NSX was included, but because of the classic status and iconic shape, the Acura NSX needs to be on every list anyone makes when talking about recent classics. The NSX was more reliable than contemporary Ferraris, and it partially developed by the late, great Ayrton Senna. The NSX was the start of the every-day supercar you could daily drive to work. Over the last few years, the NSX has seen its value increase marginally due to more people realizing its status in automotive history. If you get the chance, pick one up while they're still under $100,000. DSM Turbos (Eagle Talon and Mitsubishi Eclipse) When The Fast and the Furious first came out, one of the star cars was a heavily modified Mitsubishi Eclipse, specifically one of DSM versions, and there was a good reason for its inclusion. The Eagle Talon TSi AWD and Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX represented a new form of hot-rod: They were the start of the tuning lifestyle and because of each of the cars' small engines, massive turbos, and all-wheel-drive layouts, they were absolute rockets when modified. These are hard to find unmodified or unmolested, but if you can find a pristine example, buy it and then give them a few more years, we could see their values increase. 1990-1997 Mazda MX-5 Miata There's an adage among car enthusiasts that the Miata is always the answer, and when it comes to the first-gen NA Miata, that's especially true. The Miata first debuted at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show alongside the NSX mentioned above. Because of its now-classic status, those original Miata owners can take their British-inspired sports convertible to classic car shows and display them with pride, rather than receive derision alongside the same cars that gave rise this car. NA Miatas are also inexpensive, making them one of the cheapest ways of getting into a classic sports car. Nissan 300ZX Turbo The Nissan 300ZX Turbo has an interesting history. It's not generally as well liked as either its predecessor or its offspring. The 300ZX Turbo was just there, essentially a place holder for the future 350Z. However, it's a moniker it doesn't rightly deserve. When launched, the 300ZX Turbo competed against the Toyota Supra, a car that has since gained international acclaim by being one of the most modified and lusted after JDM cars on the planet. The 300ZX Turbo though, just fell by the wayside, even with its twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 engine that made around 300hp. The 300ZX Turbo was a great car, and we could foresee a possible future when this truly does become sought after classic. BMW 850i The BMW 8 Series was also included on Hagerty's list, but it's worth delving deeper into. The 8 Series was a GT car that was ahead of its time in terms of both looks and power. Using a 5.0-liter V-12 engine that was originally found in the 7 Series, BMW coupled the engine to either a four-speed automatic or a much more driver-centric six-speed manual gearbox. Sadly, the 8-Series was a failure and has been regulated to the annuls of history as such. However, there is still hope, perhaps people will finally see it for what it was and begin to appreciate the styling and the smooth as silk V-12. At least we can only hope.", "The first 2016 BMW M6 GT3 car to land in Australia has been unveiled in Melbourne, accompanied by confirmation the factory-supported team behind it, will take part in every Australian GT and Australian Endurance Championship round in 2016.\n\nNow confirmed to begin its local racing resume at next month's Adelaide Clipsal 500, the 2016 BMW M6 GT3 will participate in all six 'sprint' rounds of the Australian GT Championship, as well as all four Australian Endurance Championship (AEC) rounds.\n\nRacing under the BMW Team SRM (Steven Richards Motorsport) banner, the privately-owned entry will be headed, and driven, by Australian motorsport legend and four-time (1998, 1999, 2013, 2015) Bathurst 1000 winner Steve Richards (below right).\n\nThe son of local motorsport icon, and seven-time Bathurst 1000 winner, Jim Richards, Steve Richards said the process to get to this point, from initial introductions and discussions with BMW to signing an agreement, has all happened in six to seven weeks.\n\n\"As you see the car here, it's virtually, with another spanner check, ready to go testing.\n\n\"We can't wait to get out there and have a hoon around in what's going to be a pretty exciting time for BMW coming back into Australian motorsport and Steven Richards Motorsport.\"\n\nSpeaking about the car, which arrived in Melbourne from Munich on February 16 and is one of only 20 built globally, Richards said, \"I've got to say, I've seen a few good looking race cars in my time, but the first time I saw it... it was incredible.\"\n\n\"We had an allocation of two cars potentially to come to Australia, and there's real interest from customers in that second car.\"\n\nPowered by a GT3-specification version of the road-going BMW M6's standard 423kW/680Nm twin-turbocharged 4.4-litre V8, the 380,000 euro ($592,700) M6 race car outputs up to 430kW - though this can be adjusted via a real-time-accessible boost controller, according to mandated balance of performance (BoP) class regulations.\n\nHelping the M6-based GT3 racer not only look the part but also perform to the necessary competition standards, are ultra wide guards, a wider track, significant aerodynamics, Pirelli P Zero racing slicks, and AP Racing brakes on all four corners.\n\nSpeaking at the Melbourne unveiling, BMW Australia CEO Marc Werner, said the local event commences \"another chapter of BMW motorsport in Australia\".\n\n\"It's the first motorsport program we've implemented since we exited Formula One in 2009,\" Werner said.\n\n\"Our partnership with Steven Richards Motorsport provides a unique customer racing program, with benchmark driving talent and expertise, full technical support and a great parts supply.\n\n\"The initial response to this program from the general public has been sensational. And again, clearly confirms that BMW customers are performance fans willing to invest in their passion, to the point where we have several inquiries from customers wanting to switch from other brands.\n\n\"And I'll tell you that we use this unique opportunity not only as a pure brand exercise, but we will use it show our dear friends from Stuttgart [Porsche] and Ingolstadt [Audi], how real performance cars can drive.\"\n\nWerner said BMW had been taking note of the increasing global interest in customer racing, and in particular the GT championship, saying, \"In our opinion, [GT racing is] the ideal platform to get customers on board and being part of a very exciting motorsport series.\"\n\n\"And that's why we decided that this is the right arena for BMW to re-enter the motorsport arena.\"\n\nOn the topic of just how quickly he, and the team at SRM, managed to lock down the M6 GT3's 2016 Australian GT campaign, the local head said it was all a matter of timing.\n\n\"First of all, we were launching that car on a worldwide level. We launched the car in the US, we launched the car in Europe, we're going to launch it in Japan and now we are launching it here in Australia. So it's a global approach.\n\n\"And with a global approach there comes significant support from headquarters. And if you have significant support from headquarters, then things usually work quite well.\n\n\"We are committed to motorsport - I'm personally very, very much committed to motorsport. We're passionate about this.\n\n\"Whatever BMW does in terms of motorsport, we've always shown that we are highly committed and usually quite successful. How successful we are going to be, that remains to be seen, however, I'm very confident that with the setup that we've chosen, we have the right support program, in particular, for our customers in place. And that is actually the most important thing. It's about the customer. GT racing is really about the customer.\"\n\nWith rounds from the two local GT championships combined, the new BMW M6 GT3 will appear at Melbourne's Albert Park for the 2016 Australian Formula One Grand Prix, at Perth's Barbagallo Raceway, Victoria's Phillip Island, the Townsville 400 in Queensland, Sydney Motorsport Park, and New Zealand's Highlands Park and Hampton Downs - along with its debut round in Adelaide.\n\nNeither BMW or SRM would confirm the car's entry into next year's 2017 Bathurst 12 Hour, however, Richards did say, \"Clearly we want to have a couple - maybe two, maybe three cars - running at the 12 Hour.\"\n\nIn a bonus for BMW, and for fans of the marque equalling celebrating the group's centenary year, Richards' M6 GT3 will carry the number #100 for the 2016 season. And for keen trainspotters, the car will be on track at Winton Raceway for its inaugural Australian shakedown on Monday, February 22.\n\nWhat do you think of the look of the all-new 2016 BMW M6 GT3? And do you think it can 'out tough' the likes of the Audi R8 LMS, Ferrari 488 GT3, Lamborghini Huracan GT3, McLaren 650S GT3, Mercedes-AMG GT3, Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3, and Porsche 911 GT3?", "James Marshall Crotty Forbes Education Columnist; Author, 'How to Talk American'; Director, 'Crotty's Kids'; Co-founder, 'Monk Magazine'\n\nGerman automobiles are renowned for their engineering. This fine-tuned ethos of fine-tuning is not reserved to cars. Engineering itself is a German national trait, hard-wired through natural selection's work on the prevailing German zeitgeist, or Ganz Organisiert (totally organized).\n\nAlong for the evolutionary ride came German philosophy (Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Weber, Heidegger, et. al.) to bring Teutonic precision and wit (at least with Nietzsche) to how one \"should\" behave. \"As I do, so I legislate for others,\" Kant's categorical imperative implores. No wonder you rarely see a jaywalking German.\n\nHowever, German philosophy - often deliberately impenetrable - suffers from what is common to most marvels of German industry: wondrous overkill and a seeming delight in obfuscation. A question thus invariably comes to mind in contemplating other aesthetically stellar feats of German engineering, from Bosch professional power tools to Porsche engines to the Berlin International Film Festival (or Berlinale): do I really need this ridiculously complicated level of German craftsmanship? Or does something more mundane and human-centered suit my pedestrian needs better?\n\nBefore we get to all that, please indulge me a back story.\n\nBack in 1962, my late father owned a Mercedes Benz automobile. He dumped it for a series of Buick Centuries, after I, at the inquisitive age of three, ambled onto our sloping Omaha, Nebraska driveway - where the prized German import sat parked at an angle - and found a way to open the driver's door and pull the emergency brake. The Benz proceeded to roll down the driveway over my right knee, rendering me a bloody screaming mess, as my helpless, hysterical mother watched in horror from the kitchen window.\n\nMy late father did not buy another German car until almost 20 years later when he purchased \"The Ultimate Driving Machine\" from John Markel (whose father brought the first of Henry Ford's model T's to Omaha in the early 1900s). My Dad's black BMW was handsome, with sharp styling and heated leather seats (an innovation of clear value during our cold Nebraska winters). However, the \"Beemer\" never consistently worked. It was always in the shop for one intricate repair or another.\n\nSo, my late dermatologist father, despite his love for Germany and all things German - he served in Wiesbaden for several years after \"The War\" as part of America's grossly underappreciated German rebuilding effort - returned the BMW to John Markel and didn't procure another German car until many years later.\n\nBecause of that BMW memory, I never bought a German car either, let alone other aesthetically tantalizing German products that piqued my interest over the years. I just don't need the headache or heartache of a thing so sophisticated in its beauty and engineering that it consistently failed in its core mission. As in love, so in stuff: is it dependably there for me or not?\n\nInstead, I've been a Japanese car man since offloading, back in 1998, my American-made, Fleetwood Bounder Monkmobile, which suffered from the very starter issue that plagued the identical Fleetwood Bounder mobile meth lab in Breaking Bad.\n\nNevertheless, I have retained my love for Germany, Berlin in particular. Its dour, relentlessly real weather suits me. Though Berliners can be annoyingly officious, parsimonious, and rule-bound, their inherent reserve allows me to purchase a liberating intellectual lebensraum in their presence. While it pains the more emotionally needy and extroverted side of my nature (read: Irish), Berlin's dreary detachment and indomitable order act as a mental colonic that removes distraction and delusion.\n\nThis absence of noisy cultural intrusion is one of the great pleasures of visiting richly and darkly historic city, which was \"Brooklyn\" before there was the loud, hipster-consumerist playpen known as \"Williamsburg,\" let alone its west coast doppelganger of Portland. Nevertheless, you will increasingly find in Berlin the same virus plaguing other beloved Monk cities (from San Francisco to New York): American and European \"tech bros\" running ramshackle over low-tech entrepreneurial diversity, driving up rents and real estate in their inexorable march towards the all-encompassing app.\n\nYet, despite the triumph of \"techne\" (whose dehumanizing effects the controversial Martin Heidegger obliquely warned his countrymen about), there remains in Berlin an appreciation of the authentic auteur, albeit with an overt bias towards left-leaning auteurs. Though the city's earnest appeasement of every self-identified victim group threatens to reprise the social justice shouting matches (\"Black Lives Matter!\" \"All Lives Matter!\") that mar American public discourse in the Obama era, there is a refreshing, heart-warming beauty in Berlin's welcoming embrace of \"the other.\"\n\nThese better, if na\u00efve (\"if we are super generous towards Muslims, they won't attacks us\"), angels of recent German vintage, plus my memories of my Dad's ill-fated BMW, are foremost in mind as I sit in the baby stroller capital of Pankow, in the redoubt of one Frankie \"Two Kids\" Foelsch (pioneer of the German fashion trifecta Basecap, Brille undt Bart), reflecting on Berlin's defining cultural event: the annual Berlin International Film Festival (or Berlinale).\n\nThe Berlinale is widely considered - along with Venice, Cannes, Sundance and Toronto - among the five most important film festivals on earth. It is certainly the most ambitious: selling 370,000 tickets to 400 films over its 10-day run (February 11-21).\n\nHowever, as intrepid L.A. film publicist Matt Johnstone (Nakom) reminded me, the Berlinale is really seven festivals - with confusing section names like Panorama, Forum, and Generation that mean nothing to the first-time attendee -- under one giant umbrella. Its astounding variety (from classic retrospectives to Berlin-based talents to Hollywood releases to documentaries to indigenous peoples cinema to shorts to children's movies to surreal Iranian westerns to complex Chilean political dramas) makes for a rich, overstuffed smorgasbord of global cinema.\n\nHowever, it can also make navigating the darn thing a real bear.\n\nFor starters, my 60 Euro Monk press credential (normally free at any press-respecting festival) was a cold slap in the face. Secondly, one is forced to jockey for space in the under-sized Berlinale pressroom, which was outfitted with desultory PCs and not one Apple computer (hardly a sign of the \"creative class\" vortex that Berlin aspires to be).\n\nMoreover, most screenings require tickets in addition to one's credential. Ascertaining what those ticket-based screenings are (one is handed an inscrutable small sheet with tiny lettering for this purpose), why they are ticket-based, and where to procure these special tickets (not at normal ticket counters!) was hard to ascertain and, like most things at Berlinale, never fully explained. If you just show up at a screening expecting your credential to get you in, you will be told to wait in a special line. After waiting 20 minutes for entry, you will usually be told that there are no seats left, often when there are.\n\nAs an enterprising American, after a few days you think you have finally it figured out and, thus, decide to only see the tiny sliver of films with a little \"P\" (for press) next to their names. However, after you are again denied entry, you are told that some of these screenings marked \"P\" also require a ticket, which you could not possibly have known in advance.\n\nSay, what?!\n\nAfter repeated setbacks, I finally realized that the Berlinale screening calendar is a deliberately opaque jigsaw puzzle (no surprise that Germany's Bosch bought Scintilla, AG, the Swiss inventor of the electric jigsaw) designed to mercilessly test anyone without a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) degree. Some of the information you desperately need is no doubt found in a protocol document buried deep inside the Berlinale management office. The rest is in the fearsome Berlinale program. However, good luck finding that information at a glance, even with the color-coding and other systems of organization that Berlinale peeps have proudly instituted.\n\nIf you plead your confusion to a Berlinale staffer, they will invariably respond, \"Oh, it's very easy,\" with crisp annoying gusto. Yes, it's very easy if you have a German brain, which is able to construct elaborate feats of obscurantist engineering, but not to one's midwest American brain, which seeks the least convoluted path to any solution.\n\nIf you are not the kind of person who likes to study NASA rocket manuals, this labyrinthine process is likely to cause you to blow a gasket, which is probably why the vast bulk of those attending the Berlinale are Berliners. I eventually did blow a gasket after being denied entry to two straight \"press lounges,\" despite my press credential. It turns out, to even enter Berlinale press lounges, one needs a special press credential that one is never told about. Moreover, one needs to ask the Berlinale press office about these special press credentials in advance, though one doesn't even know they exist until one receives a rude and stolid press lounge rejection. To add further insult to the ongoing absurdity, these special press credentials are only given out by the Head of Press, who is conveniently \"in a meeting\" whenever one arrives to ask her about them.\n\nAnd you thought hard-core S & M died with the Berlin underground sex club scene of the 90s.\n\nAs if this Orwellian double world inside a Kafka play set on the farthest moon of Jupiter is not sufficient, there's more. Not only is the festival progamme impossible to reconnoiter, there is little attempt to pamper the poor press schmuck whose simple noble intention is to review the films found herein. In fact, the Berlinale is downright hostile to pampering. For a festival of this alleged stature, with such a high level of government and corporate support, there should be locally grown food and drink, of great and sumptuous variety, provided free to filmmakers, press and other VIPs. Nowhere is such an offering on easily accessible display, even though there is a whole section of this year's Berlinale devoted to Kulinarisches Kino (Culinary Cinema).\n\nOf course, if you are a Syrian refugee, you can get gourmet Mediterranean food - courtesy of Sardinian chef Robert Petza - from a food truck! Allah be praised!\n\nIn addition, there should be myriad, easily accessible festival-run lounges where film fans, press and filmmakers can kibitz, But the Berlinale organizers abdicated that responsibility to well-heeled corporate sponsors, whom, as I have noted, won't let you in. Ah, yes, that old familiar stench of European elitism: liberal on the outside, classist on the inside.\n\nAs for genuine parties and after-parties, you have to know someone to be invited, and even then it's near impossible. Zero attempt is made in advance or in person to connect a press person who has flown all the way across the Atlantic to such insider happenings. And good luck trying to get suddenly AWOL Berlin \"freunds\" to help on this head (it's as if you asked for a private audience with Lucifer).\n\nIn other words, there is nothing at Berlinale as cutting edge, let alone as gracious and welcoming, as found at Crotty-reviewed boutique festivals like the Reykjavik International Film Festival (RIFF), Sonoma, or what portends to be the case at the upcoming San Luis Obispo International Film Festival. The Berlinale is sterile, cold, and perfunctory, with the same red carpet nonsense and other \"celebrity\" frou-frou as found at the increasingly awful and unimaginative Palm Springs International Film Festival and Santa Barbara International Film Festival in my home base of Southern California (both of which were previously trashed in this space).\n\nFortunately, all these deficiencies can be remedied. First, the Berlinale should station an army of multilingual volunteers around the festival epicenter of Potsdamer Platz - though slightly less obstreperous than the Scientology cult members that stalk the area - to help out-of-town guests immediately get their bearings. Not just a single person waiting inside a door at a desk, but, rather, an overt congenial show of proactive support to the people who came from all corners of the globe to the city's signature cultural event.\n\nSecondly, there should be a festival boot camp for press, where part of an afternoon, over drinks and food, is spent explaining the peculiar way that Berlinale works. To help in this regard, there should be press buddies assigned to foreign press in particular to walk them through the daunting Berlinale matrix.\n\nThirdly, the festival needs to do away with its special ticket insanity. A press person like me wants to sample a variety of films without having to wait in line or even stay for the whole film. The more films I see, the better it is for the festival and those who paid inflated fees to have their films shown (not to mention the extortionate sums paid to publicists to market the film to people like me).\n\nUnfortunately, the official Berlinale press screenings often conflict with other screenings. In addition, press screenings are often in the morning, not the most auspicious time for film viewing. It behooves the Berlinale to make it super easy for press to see films throughout the day without a special ticket of any kind.\n\nAs a filmmaker (Crotty's Kids, Master Debaters), I would rather have ten members of the press at a festival screening than ten regular patrons. To that end, at every screening there should always be at least ten reserved press seats right near the exit (to not disturb non-press filmgoers). Press members should be given carte blanche freedom to quietly come and go to the press seating area. Moreover, if the film does not sell out, and more than ten press members want to attend, they should be allowed to take any other available end seat. If the end seats of the first ten rows were always reserved for press, few would be disturbed when they came and went.\n\nUnfortunately, the sort of practical, welcoming spirit is not part of the Berlinale DNA. However, if you are a refugee from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and \"other crisis regions around the world,\" that's another matter. As revealed to me by Berlin-based film critic Karsten Kastelan, the Berlinale, through its \"sponsored cinema visit\" program, gives away free tickets to refugees and goes out of its way to connect said refugees to volunteers so they can find their way to the screenings of their choice. Why is that same level of care not directed towards those who actually paid a tidy sum to fly to the Berlinale? There must be some special victim credential we forgot to pick up.\n\nThen again, I shouldn't be shocked by such treatment. Germans approach most things - festivals and political problems alike - as feats of social engineering. So why would the Berlinale be any different? The films here run on time. The seat quality is superb, even if the concessions are unoriginal. The projectionists know what they are doing. The bathrooms and common areas are clean and tidy.\n\nAnd, to be fair, it takes a high level of organizational skill to pull off a film festival and film market of this daunting size and breadth without a major hitch. Team Berlinale does it with calm, concise aplomb. As a result, I am certain they feel they've fulfilled their functional duty (the very \"standing-reserve\" POV that philosopher Martin Heidegger warned his countrymen about), as long as they check off a box for nearly every \"socially disadvantaged\" minority that could possibly apply, attend or that the Berlinale could possibly offend.\n\nHowever, actual care, feeding and comfort, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere where patrons and press from different countries and cultures can casually and calmly discuss film in a friendly, open, nurturing and humane environment, screenings in novel locales, location tours, plus genuine esprit de corps are not things that team Berlinale does well, if it even crosses their mind to do them at all.\n\nIf you are a person whose idea of a vacation is deciphering a vast cinematic puzzle, then the Byzantine Berlinale is for you. For everyone else, don't even think of wrestling with the ferocious Berlinale bear until management realizes that big is not better, greed is not good, flesh and blood people trump slavish devotion to rules, and doing things in a convoluted, if internally logical, way because \"that's how it's always been done\" is the enemy of goodwill, common sense, and the intimate, joyful, human-centered celebration of global film.\n\nJames Marshall Crotty is the peripatetic publisher of Monk: The Mobile Magazine, author of How to Talk American (Houghton Mifflin), and director of the urban debate documentary Crotty's Kids.

Her unease turned to alarm as, at the urging of her embassy contact, she directed her driver to a hospital, where she was ushered into a VIP room. Someone handed her a piece of paper with a phone number to call for information. She did.\n\n\"I'm afraid I have bad news, I think we should meet,\" Det. Rolando Garcia was saying. \"And he said: 'Jean is dead.' I knew it was true because of the way he pronounced Jean's name.\"\n\nDube dropped the phone. Her world had imploded that sunny day on March 31, 2015. Dube could barely stagger outside.\n\nNow 53, Dube had arrived from Ottawa with her two teen sons exactly two months earlier to take up her post as Canada's consul general in Miami. It had been a whirlwind of wrapping up her old job -- she had been director general for North America, helping oversee Canada's consular network in the U.S. and Mexico -- finding housing, moving, unpacking, getting the boys settled in school.\n\n\"I needed a wife, basically,\" she says. \"That's what I needed. It was very demanding.\"\n\n***\n\nDube had thought little of it when her 18-year-old son, Jean Wabafiyebazu, had asked for money to buy a textbook and take his younger brother, Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, to a restaurant and movie. The older teen had been doing well and she thought he could do with a reward. She gave him $80 and allowed them to use her black BMW, its diplomatic licence plate sporting the word \"Consul,\" because Jean's car, which she now drives, was in the shop that day. Instead, that March 30 afternoon, the brothers headed to a dingy apartment, Jean's math homework in a black Jansport backpack on the back seat. He was carrying an American-made .40 calibre Smith and Wesson handgun. His plan, police would allege, was to rob a drug dealer of about 800 grams of marijuana.\n\nJean left Marc sitting in the passenger seat, nearby trees waving in the breeze, as he went into the apartment clutching a green duffel bag emblazoned with a Moosehead beer logo and the words Jean/Marc written in fading ink. Inside, Jean and Anthony Rodriguez, then 19, had a back and forth, according to court evidence, along the lines of, \"Show me the money,\" \"Show me the drugs.\" And then, it went horribly wrong. Within minutes, Jean and another teen, Joshua Wright, 17, had died in an exchange of gunfire. Jean had been shot three times, including in the head. Rodriguez, a bullet wound to his arm, would tell police that he picked up a handgun as he bolted into the sunshine, stopping only to rush back inside to retrieve his drugs. His green iPhone was left inside in a pool of blood.\n\nOutside, an agitated and distraught Marc Wabafiyebazu, who had tried in vain to get some answers from the fleeing dealer, could only watch as Rodriguez drove off to abandon his silver Chevy Malibu at a gas station -- the same place he had been arrested a month earlier with a loaded gun for drug trafficking. Police had released him without charge two weeks before Jean's death. Minutes after the dealer's hasty exit, police ordered Marc to his knees and arrested him on the sidewalk as they swarmed the bloody, casing-riddled crime scene.\n\nFor hours, Marc was left in an interrogation room, handcuffed to a chair. No one read him his rights or warned him about the perils of speaking to the officers. Investigators refused his pleas to call his mother, who would go to bed about 10 p.m. that night wondering why she couldn't reach her kids, but assuming their phone batteries had died or that they were in a movie theatre and had turned their devices off.\n\nIn court the following day, the judge gave Dube, now stricken with the knowledge her older son was dead, 30 seconds to hug her bereft, defeated younger son.\n\n\"He said, 'Jean est mort, Jean est mort.' And I said, 'We're going to be brave now',\" she says. \"I couldn't grieve for Jean at that point. There was no space.\"\n\nMost pressing for Dube was ensuring that Marc survived. The brothers had developed an extraordinarily close bond through his mother's various postings and moves, including a stint as ambassador to Zimbabwe that began in 2005. More of a pliant follower, Marc kept saying he didn't know if he could live without his brother. In the gloom of the courtroom that day, Dube realized she had to shape up for her boy's sake.\n\n***\n\nNeither police nor prosecutors would allege Marc shot or even threatened anyone. Surveillance video at the two-storey apartment complex backs that up. But based on a purported confession he gave over a couple of minutes from the back seat of a cruiser to a rookie officer who was driving, police alleged Marc was in on his brother's planned armed robbery of the drug dealer. \"He says, 'It was a job gone wrong. I know you're a police officer but everyone is going to talk, so I may as well talk',\" Officer Juan Velez testified the accused told him. Marc, the officer testified, also said he and his brother had done such ripoffs before in Ottawa. Dube, however, is adamant that Marc said something quite different: That while Jean might have done something like that, he himself had never done so. Nevertheless, police argued, Marc had now confessed to being a party to the botched robbery and hence was, under Florida's felony law, culpable in the killings.\n\n\"These brothers know the business. They know what they're buying,\" prosecutor Marie Mato declared. \"(Marc) didn't even have to be there at all, but the fact is that he was. He was there to assist his brother in the rip.\"\n\n***\n\nEven though he had turned 15 a mere two weeks earlier and had never been in trouble with the law, Marc would be formally indicted as an adult on seven charges including felony first-degree murder, with its maximum sentence of life behind bars. Also charged separately with third-degree felony murder were the 21-year-old tenant of the apartment where the shooting happened, which police described as a filthy drug den, and Rodriguez, who had turned himself in. Police found an Argentina-made .380 Bersa Thunder handgun and bag of pot on the front seats of his car. Both co-accused would soon be granted bail and later plead out to lesser marijuana drug charges in exchange for boot-camp sentences and probation. The man who admitted to brokering the deal -- he arrived at the scene in his dad's shiny gold Cadillac and fled unhurt when the shooting started -- was never charged.\n\nAt Marc's bail hearing, Dube buried her face in her hands or dabbed at her eyes as investigators described in gruesome detail how her older son had met his violent end. She listened as they described her younger son's arrest, interrogation and confession. And then, as a witness, Dube found herself impugned as a negligent mother who had failed to properly supervise her teenaged offspring. Momentarily combative at one point, she looked the prosecutor in the eye and asked rhetorically: \"You don't have children, do you?\" The judge would later lend an official stamp of approval to the jaundiced view of Dube as a parent by stating that a desperate mother might resort to desperate measures to spare her son a lengthy prison term and, given her status as a diplomat, that made the child a flight risk. In addition, Circuit Court Judge Teresa Pooler decided the mother could not be trusted to supervise him properly. Despite being the only juvenile charged in the case, Marc was the only one denied bail pending trial.\n\n\"My vision for a better world is a world in which greed, jealousy violence etc. does not exist. Where people are not judged by their race...\" Marc had written in a high school essay shortly before the killings. \"This is a world I doubt would ever happen because of human nature.\"\n\n***\n\nAlmost a year later, Dube is still piecing together the shards of her life. At times, she talks with confidence and an unabashed optimism. Other moments, she is clearly close to tears. She stepped down as consul general last August, but remains a Canadian government employee on sick leave. The driver, who allowed her to work en route to the office, is gone, as is the packed schedule of a consul general. She's moved into a more modest rental apartment. The minimally furnished space feels temporary, makeshift, almost empty. \"Everything is completely different,\" she allows. \"Everything has changed.\"\n\nThe unfathomable grief at losing Jean, she says, has begun subsiding. As evidence, she says, she can now look at the many photographs she has of her older son, smile and say to herself, \"Wow, it was a blast for those 18 years.\"\n\n\"I have almost a sense of joy. That he's with me. He's with Marc, and he will live through us. He has managed to tell me somehow that this was meant to happen and he's OK.\"\n\nDealing with the guilt has taken a lot longer.\n\nWhen a child falls ill, the usual reaction from others is one of sympathy. When a child is accused of being a criminal, Dube would soon learn, a more common reaction is that the parents must have somehow failed. It is, she came to understand, a way for other parents to protect themselves, to be able to declare privately that something that awful could never happen to their kids.\n\n\"You really feel the blows,\" she says, growing quiet, her gaze fixed on the living room window overlooking a manicured, suburban lawn.\n\nA counsellor's words offered another revelation: Focus on what she had done right as a mother and show herself compassion for any mistakes she might have made. It was a pivotal turning point on the winding path to healing.\n\n\"It was a very long road to go from 'I am a bad mother' to 'I have made mistakes.' And there's a difference between the two.\"\n\n***\n\nA French-Canadian raised in Quebec, Dube had put herself through university before working for a decade on Parliament Hill for a prominent MP who became foreign affairs minister. Her boys' dad, Germano Wabafiyebazu, was a Congolese refugee who came to Canada in 1992. They met at the University of Ottawa in '93. She was in her early 30s when Jean was born. Marc, the \"son every mother would want to have,\" followed a couple of years later. The photographs spread out on her dining room table show the smiling siblings in various stages of childhood. In most, they sport broad winning smiles, in stark contrast to the perplexed upturned face a taller, gangly Marc would later show as he sat in brown prison garb quietly watching court proceedings.\n\nDube waves her hands as she talks about feeling the need to dig deeper, much deeper, to ask herself what had happened to explain the calamity that had befallen them. Jean had done well in school. He was popular, athletic, smart. She and his father, from whom she separated after her tour as ambassador to Zimbabwe, loved him. They had been strong, supportive, hard-working role models. She had done all the right mom things. She drove him everywhere. They talked. And yet he had drifted into a rougher crowd in Ottawa and had started dabbling in drugs, apparently more with the notion of selling them than using them.\n\n\"He wanted money. He wanted to be rich quickly,\" she says. \"He knew what he was doing.\"\n\nJean had been arrested in Ottawa on a minor drug-possession charge. He talked of dropping out of high school. Dube and his father sat him down to talk about what was happening with him. He agreed to change schools, away from what they considered the bad influence of his older friends. He wept in embarrassment. \"He knew we wanted the best for him,\" she says.\n\nBut there was something yet deeper that Dube now faults herself for not recognizing. She had tried to exercise parental authority by doling out money, by forbidding his unsupervised use of the car _ external things, she calls them. What she might have missed, she says, was the internal: Jean was in the throes of a biracial identity crisis. The son of a black father and white mother, he had started bumping up against the negative views too many people hold of black youth. It destabilized him, she says. Despite what many might see as the wealth of resources available to her, she found it difficult reaching out to family or friends for help in dealing with a troubled, independent-minded son she wanted to protect. In retrospect, she says, she had become isolated as a parent and needed help. She should have done more to find it, she says.\n\n\"He needed help and I needed help,\" she says. \"He could have been saved.\"\n\n***\n\nIronically, Dube has now become a source of wisdom and strength for other parents going through their own versions of child or teenage hell. She has, she believes, become a better mother. She has visited Marc whenever allowed over the past year -- mostly through glass in the juvenile section of an adult prison -- where she was invariably the only white woman among Hispanics and blacks. Everyone, it seems, knows who she is. Despite her own pain, or perhaps because of it, she talks of the strong urge to want to comfort the often bewildered relatives she encounters on visiting days.\n\n\"I want to scream, 'I'm so with you!'\" she says.\n\nDube is acutely aware of the special ridicule reserved for mothers who declare their children \"innocent,\" no matter how heinous their crimes. Jean, she says, most certainly played a crucial role in what happened that fateful March day; he committed a crime, with devastating consequences.\n\n\"You have two young lives, full of talent, full of dreams, who died so unnecessarily for two stupid pounds of marijuana,\" she sighs.\n\nOn the other hand, she insists, Marc was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He knows he should not have been there. He has taken responsibility for his role, she says. But what's equally clear is that he did not commit murder or even an armed robbery. \"He did not participate in the felony. He was sitting in the car in the passenger seat, no means of communicating with his brother, unarmed.\"\n\nStill, rather than submit to the vagaries of a trial at which his co-accused would testify against him, and the potentially severe consequences of a conviction, Marc pleaded no contest on Friday to four charges, including two counts of third-degree felony murder -- one for his brother's death -- as well as aggravated battery. From her seat below a sign reading, \"We who labour here seek only truth,\" and after grilling Dube on whether she would properly supervise her son, Judge Pooler accepted the plea along with the jointly recommended sentence of boot camp, modified house arrest and up to eight years of probation. Crucially, if he completes the sentence without incident, he will have no criminal conviction.\n\n\"Essentially, he is paying the price for Jean. He is also pleading to the murder of his own brother,\" Dube says.\n\n***\n\nIt's been tough, Dube says reflectively. She still doesn't have her car back from police. Her surviving son is still not home. But Marc, who once told her they would get through the ordeal one day at a time, has been doing well, although forced to grow up faster than they might have wished. In his fellow inmates, he has seen first-hand the consequences of parental neglect, abuse and cripplingly broken homes. He speaks with compassion about them, she says. If she has grown as a mother, so has her son. They have started looking forward to the day when they can put this tragic chapter of their lives behind them and really start to move on, to rebuild, although exactly how and where is not clear. The no-contest plea and conditional sentence, at least, has allowed for more certainty.\n\nJean is long buried in Ottawa. He was, his mom says, fiercely protective of his only sibling. At Marc's request, his tombstone carries the epitaph:", "Turner Motorsport gives their BMW M5 project a new visual upgrade.

(Photo by Kimberly McKinzie)\n\nThere's nothing like getting run over by a car to put things in perspective.\n\nWhen Kevin Parker landed in Rochester from Flint, Mich., four years ago he found himself alone in an unfamiliar city. He and his wife had decided to live apart for several months while their daughter finished her sophomore year of high school, allowing him to begin the task of transforming the former Holtz House of Vehicles into the Garber Automotive Group.\n\nBut shortly after arriving here, Parker was hit by a car in the parking lot of the hotel where he was living. He was talking to his wife on the phone when the accident happened.\n\n\"Luckily I put my hand down and went over (the car) as opposed to under it, or I wouldn't have lived. My wife was talking to me and all she heard was 'ahh' and the phone went dead,\" recalls Parker, Garber's 50-year-old managing partner.\n\nIt was an eye-opening experience, Parker says of the accident and subsequent recovery.\n\n\"I think throughout that time I realized how quickly your life can change. It stopped my life for a moment,\" he says. \"That spring the flowers smelled better. The sunshine was brighter.\"\n\nAfter several surgeries and weeks of rehab for his mangled leg, Parker returned to the task at hand: revamping and expanding the auto franchises Garber Auto had purchased and, perhaps more importantly, maintaining the customer loyalty that former owner John Holtz had built in his four decades in the auto business.\n\n\"One of the things we felt passionate about when we bought these stores was to keep as many of these employees as we could because John had a good reputation in a lot of areas and we wanted to maintain that,\" Parker said of the transition. \"Our first ad campaign was 'new name, same faces.'\"\n\nIndeed, the dealerships have changed little in that regard since Garber Auto took over. The company employs 215 in Rochester, up slightly from the roughly 200 Holtz employed. Though Parker declined to discuss local revenue, he noted the Honda facility continues to be the No. 1 volume Honda dealer in Western New York, and locally the firm sold roughly 4,000 new and used vehicles last year.\n\nThe Michigan-based company's 15 dealerships nationwide gross in excess of $400 million annually and employ 1,450 people. Garber Auto ranked sixth on the Rochester Business Journal's most recent list of auto dealers, based on the number of vehicles sold locally.\n\n\"It takes a lot of people to make this company go,\" Parker says. \"My partner's (Dick Garber) favorite saying, and I've adopted it now, is that tall buildings have strong foundations.\"\n\nA century of experience\n\nIn 1907 Guy Garber was a farm implement salesman in Michigan who had been approached by William Durant, General Motors Corp.'s co-founder. Durant had asked Garber to help him take the public from the horse and buggy to the automobile.\n\nGarber became a factory representative for Buick Motor Division and during his first six months with the company he established a dealership in Battle Creek, Mich. In 1910 Garber opened a Buick dealership in Saginaw, Mich., where the company headquarters remains more than a century later.\n\nWhen Garber died in 1965, his son, Richard Garber Sr., took over the company, continuing to build on his father's commitment to service. When the younger Garber died seven years later, his brother-in-law, Norman Geyer, took over as president.\n\nGeyer ran the company until 1980, when Richard Garber Jr. took the reins. Garber was the third generation to run the company and the youngest Buick dealer for a dealership of its size in the nation. He continues as president.\n\nGarber Auto's 15 dealerships nationwide represent 15 manufacturers. The company has a strong presence in both Michigan and Florida, and in Rochester represents Honda, Acura, Porsche and Audi. Garber Auto also has a 30-car showroom in Chicago.\n\nGarber Auto set up shop in New York in 2011, in part as a result of Richard Dorschel touting the region in a Buick Twenty Group the two dealers were members of. Twenty Groups are set up to enable dealer owners from non-competing areas to get together to learn from one another and increase profitability.\n\n\"Rick always spoke so highly of Rochester,\" Garber says. \"I had only heard great things about the community and how diversified and vibrant it was.\"\n\nWhen another friend called Garber and told him there might be an opportunity to move into the region via the acquisition of some franchises belonging to Holtz House of Vehicles, Garber was intrigued.\n\n\"I had the foundation, having known Rick, and also Rochester's reputation speaks for itself,\" Garber says. \"It's truly one of the dynamic communities in the United States, so we were very interested.\"\n\nHoltz had gotten his start in the automotive business working with his father as a youngster. He opened his first dealership -- a Honda store on West Henrietta Road -- in 1977 and spent more than 40 years in the industry. He received the Mercedes-Benz franchise in 1980 and shortly thereafter obtained the BMW franchise.\n\nIn 2010 Holtz had decided to retire from the auto business. He sold his Mercedes-Benz and BMW franchises to Buffalo's West Herr Automotive Group.\n\nHis decision to sell his businesses and retire took some time, Holtz told the RBJ in 2012, but he wanted time to be able to focus on his family and the community.\n\nWhat appealed most to Holtz as he considered selling his five auto franchises was ensuring that his employees would continue to receive paychecks, he said. The Garber Group offered that.\n\nAlthough Mazda was part of the original acquisition, Garber Auto sold the franchise to Marketplace Mazda Suzuki in 2013 when Suzuki stopped selling cars in the United States.\n\n\"We've had some changes over the years, no question about that,\" Parker says. \"But we are very blessed to have the majority of the people we hired the day we took over still here.\"\n\nMerging principles\n\nWhen Parker joined Garber Auto in 2001 he already had 17 years' experience in the industry. He had joined Hank Graff Chevrolet in a suburb of Flint, Mich., as a young adult, working his way through sales and management before meeting with Garber as a potential partner in the firm.\n\nHis first job, though, was working with his father, an entrepreneur who owned a lumberyard and home improvement store in Flint. From his dad Parker learned the importance of hard work.\n\n\"I learned that there is always something to do. Even when that job's done, go do something else,\" he says.\n\nFrom his first two bosses -- his father and the owner of Graff Chevy -- Parker learned a lot about the people end of business.\n\n\"I think I learned more watching my father interact with people -- whether it was the guy who worked at General Motors on the production line who had a rental home who was trying to fix it up or a U.S. congressman who maybe lived in that area -- my dad was fair to both of them,\" Parker recalls. \"That's a tremendous asset that I learned from my father.\"\n\nBut it is Garber, Parker says, who changed his life. He took a chance on him when Parker decided to leave his previous job in 2001.\n\n\"Dick really has done what few people do in business,\" Parker explains. \"A lot of times you're interviewing for a job and they over-promise and under-deliver. He didn't do that at all. In fact, he's exceeded my wildest expectations with opportunities.\n\n\"When I think of a young kid from Flint, Mich., to get the opportunities and be afforded the exposure I've had to some of these brands, I have to pinch myself at times,\" Parker adds.\n\nSince arriving in Rochester, Parker has made it his mission to make sure the dealerships live up to both the Holtz and Garber names.\n\n\"We have a mission statement that says to be the best sales and service operation in all markets we serve,\" Parker says. \"I think in order to grow our company -- because I have a responsibility not only here in Rochester, but also to the organization -- it's making sure we have a world-class relationship with our employees and customers. The expectations are quite high here.\"\n\nAlthough the dealership's short-term goals vary little across the company, Parker has set his own long-term goal: to outperform the other Garber Auto stores.\n\n\"Within our group we all have some egos, if you will. We compare our sales and our growth,\" Parker says. \"We've got an auto mall in Florida that's more established than we are and they do very well. So that's kind of the bullseye that we're aiming for, to make sure our properties here outperform them.\"\n\nParker says what makes Garber Auto successful is that it operates a little differently than some of its competitors.\n\n\"Any company that's survived 108 years has to be a little different than many. All our decisions and plans are guided by our values,\" he explains. \"As you walk my business you'll see lots of mission statements, but you'll never see our values. Because values aren't posted, values are lived.\"\n\nThose values include honesty, empathy, respect, work ethic, integrity and pride.\n\n\"A value's only a value once it's tested. That's the No. 1 thing I bring to this every day,\" Parker says. \"And my responsibility as a partner in this organization is that those values get lived.\"\n\nParker recalls an incident in which those company values were substantiated. A Canadian family was driving through Rochester on their way to New York City for a family gathering. Their car broke down and when they arrived at a Garber Auto facility it was closed.\n\nOne employee was still there and though a part was not available to fix the vehicle immediately, the employee made arrangements for the family to leave their car and take a courtesy vehicle downstate. When the part arrived, Garber Auto fixed the vehicle and drove it to the family and returned with the courtesy vehicle.\n\n\"Our employees are empowered to make decisions. And we never make decisions based on profit or loss,\" Parker says. \"I think the true test is when a customer calls us with a concern. It's a great opportunity to turn that around. Because the true test of a business isn't when things go right, it's when they don't.\"\n\nYou cannot put a price on customer success, says Service Director Billy Buechel.\n\n\"If we made a mistake and it cost us $1,000, we would happily pay that. You're in power to make those decisions,\" says Buechel, who spent two decades with Holtz prior to the acquisition. \"If we're lucky enough to be able to fix that problem, we're allowed to spend whatever to make that customer happy.\"\n\nGarber says the company's success is a result of creating a culture of high employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction.\n\n\"Our mission statement simply says the only time we do our job correctly, properly, is when we create an experience for the customer they return for,\" Garber says. \"The highest priority for us is always doing the right thing.\"\n\nGarber has been blessed to have a great senior leadership team and great partners such as Parker, he says.\n\n\"And this is, candidly, a real simple philosophy that my grandfather started in business over 100 years ago. We're just carrying on his legacy,\" he adds. \"We really don't try to overcomplicate it.\"\n\nUps and downs\n\nDespite its successes, Garber Auto, like most car dealerships, is not without its challenges.\n\nBecause the firm believes in promoting from within, inorganic growth can be problematic, especially as Garber Auto eyes acquisitions outside its home state or region, Parker says.\n\n\"We are a financially sound company. We won't buy a company if we don't have someone who's been part of our culture that we can put in there,\" Parker says. \"I think we've kind of failed the organization by not having more men and women ready to run businesses that are mobile. Some will do it if we buy the store down the road.\"\n\nAnother challenge the company faces is an industrywide problem. New technology has changed the way customers shop for vehicles.\n\n\"Three years ago the average person that purchased a vehicle shopped four to five dealerships before they bought,\" Parker notes. \"That's now 1.2. They're doing most of their work online so there's less people coming through the doors. So oftentimes there's a lot of idle time for our sales staff.\"\n\nBut Parker is comfortable with challenge.\n\n\"The challenges ahead of me every day are amazing,\" he says. \"I don't know who I'm going to meet, the situation I'm going to have. Some of the customers over the years that started with a situation or a concern have turned into some of our most loyal.\"\n\nThe best part of his job is interacting with employees and customers and dealing with the everyday glitches that come with running a business.\n\n\"My philosophy is, and I tell our leaders this all the time, that employees and customers are not an interruption in our day. They're the reason we're here,\" he says.\n\nParker is described as a hands-on manager who takes pride in his relationships with employees and customers.\n\n\"He is a lead-by-example person,\" Buechel says. \"He wouldn't ask you to do something he wouldn't do himself. He's here six days a week and he touches every department every day.\"\n\nParker welcomes ideas and input from employees, Buechel adds, especially when those suggestions will make customers and staffers happier.\n\nTony Tortorella was a Holtz customer prior to Garber's move into Rochester and quickly became friends with the dealership's new manager.\n\n\"I'm in a few times a year for regular maintenance and some of the service people I call by their name. I think for the amount of money we spend on vehicles -- which are rolling computers -- it gives you a high sense of satisfaction that after the sale you're treated as good, if not better, than you were prior to the sale,\" Tortorella says. \"I know that's a real hallmark that he wants to get out there and I think he's delivering it.\"\n\nIt is a great buying experience at Garber Auto, but what really makes the dealership stand out is that the service department goes out of its way to make clients feel comfortable, he says.\n\n\"Whatever your job is, if you're comfortable where you work and you have the proper tools you're going to do a better job. I think he has achieved that,\" Tortorella says.\n\nGarber calls Parker bright, enthusiastic and energetic.\n\n\"Kevin seldom has a bad day. He's one of the most positive people that I've ever met,\" Garber says. \"He understands our business and he's a very inspirational leader.\"\n\nAt home\n\nParker and his wife of 28 years, Kris, live in Fairport with their daughter, Madison. The couple also has a son, Brandon, and daughter, Kassidy. Recently they became first-time grandparents to Zoey.\n\nAlthough he has numerous business and civic achievements -- including serving as the 2011 United Way Capital Campaign chairman and receiving the 2008 Rotary Governor's Award, among other things while in Michigan -- Parker says his greatest achievement is his 28-year marriage.\n\n\"And God love her, because I've moved her several times to new cities,\" he says.\n\nParker enjoys golf in his free time and he and his family have an affinity for the water.\n\n\"I love the Finger Lakes and I love being on the water. My wife and I have a small boat and we are at peace when we're on the boat,\" he says. \"When we raised our kids we boated a lot. When you go to the mall you're separated. When you're on the water on a little boat you're with them. It really brought us together as a family.\"\n\nAlthough he has spent his entire adult life in the automotive industry, Parker at one time aspired to be a comedian.\n\n\"After high school I did some stand-up. It was interesting, but I didn't pursue it,\" he says. \"It might be one of my regrets; maybe I should have gone to New York City, Chicago, L.A, and really given it a try. Who knows?\"\n\nWith his feet firmly planted in Rochester now, Parker plans to become more involved with community and charitable organizations here. Giving back to the community is an important philosophy of both Parker and Garber Auto.\n\n\"I think giving back is an important thing. People want to do business with people they know, like or trust. And they only get to know, like or trust you through time and getting involved,\" Parker says. \"My dad taught me, nothing happens in this world until someone raises their hand and says I'll help. So, giving back is important.\"\n\nKevin Parker\n\nPosition: General manager/managing partner, Garber Automotive Group\n\nAge: 50\n\nFamily: Wife, Kris; son, Brandon, 27; daughters Kassidy, 24, and Madison, 19; and granddaughter, Zoey\n\nHome: Fairport\n\nActivities: Golf, boating\n\nQuote: \"We have a mission statement that says to be the best sales and service operation in all markets we serve.

Oge Author of the book, DRIVING THE FUTURE: Combating Climate Change with Cleaner, Smarter Cars, and former Director of the Office of Transportation Air Quality at the US EPA\n\nOn a sunny Friday in July of 2011, President Obama stepped to a lectern in the Rose Garden and announced the first ever regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. They were ambitious. By 2025, the rules would double the fuel efficiency and halve the greenhouse gas emissions of new passenger vehicles on America's roads. But the President's company on the stage was even more remarkable: 13 auto executives, including the heads of GM, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota and BMW. Industry usually pushes back on any new regulations, but these executives were applauding the tough new measures. They must have known they were getting a fair and flexible deal.\n\nHow have the regulations done since then? Very well. After decades of intransigence, fuel economy is quickly rising. The Economist magazine called the regulations the sixth most effective action to slow global warming ever. Automakers have not only been able to meet, but have consistently exceeded their annual regulatory requirements. Over a quarter of vehicles produced in 2015 already meet the standards for 2018. In 2015, sales topped 17.5 million vehicles. Not only is this a near record high, it is about three million more vehicles than the industry sold when the regulations came into effect.\n\nIn short, the rules seem like a pretty good deal for everyone involved--the automakers, consumers and the planet. But recently, some car companies are starting to push back. Why now? Most likely because this June, as part of the rule, there is a \"Mid-term Review\" where the government has to review the standards, decide to strengthen, weaken or just reaffirm them. As we approach this review, it is appropriate that we separate truth from fiction.\n\nMyth #1: In 2025, every new car will have to achieve the regulation's goal of 54.5 miles per gallon.\n\nNot True. First, the 54.5 miles per gallon number is not an ironclad requirement for every vehicle but a projected average for all new 2025 vehicles sold. There are, in fact, a wide variety of individual fuel efficiency standards based on the size of new vehicles. Thus, cars and trucks have their own individual set of standards, which are quite different.\n\nElementary physics holds that large trucks have a much harder time reaching 54.5 mpg than subcompacts, so the regulation has stricter requirements for smaller vehicles. For example, the Honda Fit is required to get 62 mpg while the GM Silverado is required to get 35 mpg by 2025. The regulation is designed to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions for every vehicle while also understanding that some vehicles can improve more quickly than others.\n\nEven more important is to understand that the 54.5mpg metric is based on an archaic set of laboratory test procedures that Congress has not changed since 1972. In real life, the standards translate into an EPA window sticker mileage of around 35-40 mpg, which many cars can already achieve and surpass today. Sadly, it is unlikely this now 34 year old disconnect will be fixed by Congress any time soon.\n\nMyth #2: With low gasoline prices consumers, are buying more SUVs so the Government should change the standards and not force consumers into small cars.\n\nNot True. There are two huge problems with this argument. First the regulations are very flexible -- designed to give consumer choices to buy any car they want regardless of gasoline prices. If consumers decide they want to buy SUVs instead of compacts, the car companies aren't penalized for producing more SUVs. In fact, a manufacturer, let's say Chrysler, could sell nothing but SUVs, as long as those larger vehicles meet the standards established by the regulation. The bottom line is that the consumer buying an SUV today will have a car that is more fuel efficient and cleaner than a SUVs purchased in 2010. By 2025, it will be even cleaner and more fuel-efficient than today.\n\nSecond, gas prices are extremely variable. In February of 2007, for example, the average pump price was about $2.10 a gallon. Four months later it had risen by a dollar. After another year, it was up to around $4.10 nationwide. Six months after that, it cratered down to $1.59. A little over a year and a half ago, we were paying about $3.60. It is extremely hard to say what we will be paying for gas in 2020, much less 2025.\n\nWe shouldn't base regulations on shot-in-the-dark guesses about fuel prices.\n\nThe environment doesn't care about seesawing gas prices. The one constant in this equation is that weakening fuel efficiency standards will always increase carbon emissions and accelerate the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nMyth #3: Companies are forced to produce electric and hybrid cars to meet the 2025 standard.\n\nNot True: The ambitious regulations are based almost exclusively on the improvements in conventional, gas-powered vehicles. With strategies like engine downsizing and turbocharging, lighter weight materials, mild hybrids with stop/start systems, and higher transmission gears, it is assumed no more than 1-3 % of vehicles sold in 2025 will need to be electrics and hybrids. Guess what? Sales numbers are already there in 2016.\n\nThe good news is that the regulations have encouraged the auto industry to invest heavily in electrification. For example, in September GM announced a near tripling in the size of its Warren, Michigan Battery Lab. GM says it's now the largest in North America.\n\nGM's CEO, Mary Barra recently said \"I think electrification will continue to grow as we go forward.\" \"It's a lot about the technology. As we continue to make breakthroughs in technology I think you will see that advance, but again I think a very important segment of the auto market globally.\"\n\nWhen we cut through the myths, we can see successful and flexible regulations. These rules have led to huge gains in fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction while allowing automakers and consumers plenty of latitude to make their own decisions. The gains in fuel efficiency have saved consumers and businesses billions at the pump. We are on target to achieve 54.5 mpg by 2025, with a healthier auto industry and a cleaner planet and even more savings. We cannot afford to weaken these standards. Fortunately, there is no good reason to do so.", "Hello readers and welcome to today's round of Letters to Doug. I'm your host, Doug, and today I will be responding to Letters.

Just send your letters to me at Letters2Doug@gmail.com, and I'll see to it that it gets a) read, and b) discarded. I say this because only a very small portion of letters from a very lucky group of readers gets answered. I print the rest and then I eat the paper to stay alive.\n\nAnyway, on to today's letter, which comes to us from a reader I've named Rafael. He writes:\n\nDear Doug,\n\nI have a conundrum. I am very stingy, but I have had this dream since I was a pimple-faced high schooler. I have always wanted to own a Honda with a Type-R badge. Unfortunately for me, 2001 was the last time they made one and I had about enough money to buy 6 Jack-in-the Box tacos.\n\nLo and behold, 15 years later Honda announces a new Type-R for model year 2018 and I've been employed 10 years that put me on the right side of the median salary. But life curses me again! Capitalism has this little thing called pent-up demand and I know I'm not the only Fast and the Furious kid who has a job and no more student loans (well maybe there are a lot who still have student loans).\n\nMy question is, how the hell do I avoid being extorted by (based on my experience) the most unwilling to budge dealership group, Honda? I can wait. But it will be fairly limited (2 year run maybe, low production numbers) and used Hondas depreciate about as much as a house in San Francisco. I don't want to miss it like my managers missed out on the 1M (\"I'll buy in 3 years for $30k\"). Am I doomed to pay more than MSRP? Or is there another way?\n\nSincerely,\n\nRafael\n\nYou've asked a very good question, Rafael, specifically: how do I buy a highly demanded car without paying dealer markup? Fortunately, this one is simple: you don't.\n\nHere's the problem, Rafael: we have, in this economic structure, something called supply and demand, where the entity that has the supply gets to set the price based on demand for the good it's peddling. This is why Porsche generally sells its cars for MSRP, while Chrysler dealerships are lucky to get thirty-seven bucks and a makeup mirror.\n\nAlthough automotive prices generally follow the same basic structure when it comes to supply and demand, a hot new car is a different story. There's no haggling. There's no dealer selling the car for invoice just so he can make enough in holdback to buy a lemonade from the nine-year-old girl down the street. Instead, there's something called a \"market adjustment,\" where the dealership takes a look at the manufacturer's suggested retail price, giggles at the appearance of the word \"suggested,\" and then adds four grand to the window sticker.\n\nWill this happen to the new Civic Type-R? Maybe. Maybe not. If I were betting, I'd expect it would. And there is nothing you can do about it.\n\nHere's what I've learned about car dealerships: some are good. Some are bad. But regardless of quality, they're all in business to make money. If someone's willing to pay four grand over sticker and you aren't, they're going to sell it to four-grand-over-sticker guy, even if you are, in fact, the salesperson's mother, and you wash his underwear for him.\n\nAnd so, if you aren't willing to pay four grand over sticker, you're screwed. You basically have three strategies: you can wait. You can pay it. Or you can buy used.\n\nIf I didn't want to pay over sticker, I'd wait. Virtually every car that sells at some huge premium when it first comes out eventually takes a nosedive into \"seen it already\" territory - and that's when deals and incentives start coming out. Sure, there are examples where this never really happened, like the BMW 1 Series M and the LaFerrari. But let's be clear: Honda isn't BMW, and they certainly aren't Ferrari. If they see an opportunity to make money, they'll probably produce as many cars as they can until the well runs dry.\n\nOf course, you can also buy used. Cars like the new Civic Type-R usually follow a predictable pattern: some rich guy gets ahold of it because he's wanted one since he was 14. Then he drives it for a while and realizes it's crashy and loud and not luxurious compared to his BMW 6 Series, and by the way, he forgot how annoying it is to drive a stick shift in the San Francisco Bay Area. So he tires of it quickly and he lists the thing on Craigslist, eager to move on to his next bad idea. That's when you swoop in, Rafael, and buy the car without paying the premium.\n\nThe last strategy is obvious: you could just pay the premium. After all, life is short, and what's a couple grand extra for the car of your dreams? Go for it, Rafael. Do it. You know you want to. Oh, by the way, can I borrow it to film a video?", "ONE of the giants of the US automotive industry is coming to Holden showrooms.\n\nThe gigantic GMC Acadia -- a full-size seven-seat SUV favoured by American families -- is one of 24 new imported vehicles that will fill Holden showrooms by 2020.\n\nThe announcement was made at a top secret meeting at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena, where Holden outlined to its national dealer network its vision for the future after the homegrown Commodore goes out of production in late 2017.\n\nA Holden badge will replace the GMC logo on the chrome grille but it is expected to keep the Acadia name.\n\nIt is one of a number of General Motors vehicles to come from the US, including the next generation Corvette sports-car and other SUVs.\n\nAlthough Holden has previously said the majority of its future cars will be sourced from Europe, the US, Thailand and Korea, the company refused to confirm the Acadia is coming, despite telling more than 400 dealer representatives.\n\nA spokesman told News Corp Australia \"we will not discuss future model plans\".\n\nBut senior executives told Holden dealers the Acadia will fill the void left when the arch rival Ford Territory goes out of production at Broadmeadows in October this year -- and it will also bridge the gap to luxury SUVs, one of the fastest growing segments of the new-car market.\n\nThe Holden Acadia is not due to arrive in showrooms until late 2017 and price is yet to be confirmed, but dealers speculated it would cost between $45,000 and $60,000 and be available with a choice of petrol or diesel power, giving Holden a flagship SUV to challenge the likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.\n\nCar industry research shows the massive growth in luxury SUV sales has come largely from traditional Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon buyers, who have \"upgraded\" to a prestige badge and a roomier vehicle.\n\nHolden hopes to claw back some of that lost ground. Ford is yet to announce which vehicle will replace the Territory which is due to go out of production at the same time as the Falcon when Broadmeadows is shut forever in October 2016.\n\n-- Holden Astra arrives and local Cruze production ends: late 2016\n\n-- Chevrolet Silverado pick-up: Even though the recently released arch rival Ram pick-up has a queue of Australian customers after the appointment of a new distributor linked to Holden Special Vehicles, GM is unlikely to convert the Silverado pick-up for right-hand-drive.\n\n-- Opel van: There is a General Motors version of the Renault Trafic van in Europe (sold as an Opel in Europe and a Vauxhall in the UK) but Holden has ruled it out for now because it wants to focus on the ute market, not the van market.", "Cadillac, General Motors Co's luxury brand, will increase its sales in China this year by 25 percent to more than 100,000 vehicles, Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen said on Friday in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe company sold around 175,000 Cadillacs in the United States in 2015.\n\nCadillac last month began production at a new factory in China of its flagship sedan, the CT6, which is expected to help boost sales. It joins the long wheelbase ATS and XTS sedans already produced in China.\n\n\"China is a very important part of the globalisation of Cadillac, and we actually seek to establish China as a substantial second volume hub for the brand,\" de Nysschen said.\n\nIf China overtakes the United States as Cadillac's top sales market, that would be \"a long way off,\" perhaps five to 10 years, de Nysschen said.\n\nCadillac and Ford's Lincoln are among a second wave of luxury car brands in China that seek to take market share from established brands such as BMW, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen's Audi.\n\nThe brand will expand its product portfolio and \"aggressively\" localize production, de Nysschen said. The new plant that currently only produces the CT6 can be eventually expanded to 150,000 total capacity. The company will next introduce the crossover sports utility vehicle XT5 into local production and plans to launch four additional models in China by 2020, doubling its locally produced product offerings, he said.\n\nCadillac brand cars are produced through GM's joint venture with SAIC Motor. China requires foreign automakers to form joint ventures with local partners in order to manufacture domestically. Cars imported to China face stiff tariffs.\n\n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Bill Trott and Phil Berlowitz)\n\nThis story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.", "The unease Canada's top diplomat in Miami was feeling as her car threaded its way to work that bright, warm early morning was becoming more insistent.\n\nHer phone rang.\n\n\"Are your kids OK?\" a senior official at Canada's Embassy in Washington was asking.\n\n\"And then,\" Roxanne Dube says in her French-accented lilt, \"I knew something was not correct.\"\n\nAs she would later discover, local authorities had contacted the U.S. State Department, which had in turn contacted the Canadian Embassy. Her unease turned to alarm as, at the urging of her embassy contact, she directed her driver to a hospital, where she was ushered into a VIP room. Someone handed her a piece of paper with a phone number to call for information. She did.\n\n\"I'm afraid I have bad news, I think we should meet,\" Det. Rolando Garcia was saying. \"And he said: 'Jean is dead.' I knew it was true because of the way he pronounced Jean's name.\"\n\nDube dropped the phone. Her world had imploded that sunny day on March 31, 2015. Dube could barely stagger outside.\n\nNow 53, Dube had arrived from Ottawa with her two teen sons exactly two months earlier to take up her post as Canada's consul general in Miami. It had been a whirlwind of wrapping up her old job -- she had been director general for North America, helping oversee Canada's consular network in the U.S. and Mexico -- finding housing, moving, unpacking, getting the boys settled in school.\n\n\"I needed a wife, basically,\" she says. \"That's what I needed. It was very demanding.\"\n\n***\n\nDube had thought little of it when her 18-year-old son, Jean Wabafiyebazu, had asked for money to buy a textbook and take his younger brother, Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, to a restaurant and movie. The older teen had been doing well and she thought he could do with a reward. She gave him $80 and allowed them to use her black BMW, its diplomatic licence plate sporting the word \"Consul,\" because Jean's car, which she now drives, was in the shop that day. Instead, that March 30 afternoon, the brothers headed to a dingy apartment, Jean's math homework in a black Jansport backpack on the back seat. He was carrying an American-made .40 calibre Smith and Wesson handgun. His plan, police would allege, was to rob a drug dealer of about 800 grams of marijuana.\n\nJean left Marc sitting in the passenger seat, nearby trees waving in the breeze, as he went into the apartment clutching a green duffel bag emblazoned with a Moosehead beer logo and the words Jean/Marc written in fading ink. Inside, Jean and Anthony Rodriguez, then 19, had a back and forth, according to court evidence, along the lines of, \"Show me the money,\" \"Show me the drugs.\" And then, it went horribly wrong. Within minutes, Jean and another teen, Joshua Wright, 17, had died in an exchange of gunfire. Jean had been shot three times, including in the head. Rodriguez, a bullet wound to his arm, would tell police that he picked up a handgun as he bolted into the sunshine, stopping only to rush back inside to retrieve his drugs. His green iPhone was left inside in a pool of blood.\n\nOutside, an agitated and distraught Marc Wabafiyebazu, who had tried in vain to get some answers from the fleeing dealer, could only watch as Rodriguez drove off to abandon his silver Chevy Malibu at a gas station -- the same place he had been arrested a month earlier with a loaded gun for drug trafficking. Police had released him without charge two weeks before Jean's death. Minutes after the dealer's hasty exit, police ordered Marc to his knees and arrested him on the sidewalk as they swarmed the bloody, casing-riddled crime scene.\n\nFor hours, Marc was left in an interrogation room, handcuffed to a chair. No one read him his rights or warned him about the perils of speaking to the officers. Investigators refused his pleas to call his mother, who would go to bed about 10 p.m. that night wondering why she couldn't reach her kids, but assuming their phone batteries had died or that they were in a movie theatre and had turned their devices off.\n\nIn court the following day, the judge gave Dube, now stricken with the knowledge her older son was dead, 30 seconds to hug her bereft, defeated younger son.\n\n\"He said, 'Jean est mort, Jean est mort.' And I said, 'We're going to be brave now',\" she says. \"I couldn't grieve for Jean at that point. There was no space.\"\n\nMost pressing for Dube was ensuring that Marc survived. The brothers had developed an extraordinarily close bond through his mother's various postings and moves, including a stint as ambassador to Zimbabwe that began in 2005. More of a pliant follower, Marc kept saying he didn't know if he could live without his brother. In the gloom of the courtroom that day, Dube realized she had to shape up for her boy's sake.\n\n***\n\nNeither police nor prosecutors would allege Marc shot or even threatened anyone. Surveillance video at the two-storey apartment complex backs that up. But based on a purported confession he gave over a couple of minutes from the back seat of a cruiser to a rookie officer who was driving, police alleged Marc was in on his brother's planned armed robbery of the drug dealer. \"He says, 'It was a job gone wrong. I know you're a police officer but everyone is going to talk, so I may as well talk',\" Officer Juan Velez testified the accused told him. Marc, the officer testified, also said he and his brother had done such ripoffs before in Ottawa. Dube, however, is adamant that Marc said something quite different: That while Jean might have done something like that, he himself had never done so. Nevertheless, police argued, Marc had now confessed to being a party to the botched robbery and hence was, under Florida's felony law, culpable in the killings.\n\n\"These brothers know the business. They know what they're buying,\" prosecutor Marie Mato declared. \"(Marc) didn't even have to be there at all, but the fact is that he was. He was there to assist his brother in the rip.\"\n\n***\n\nEven though he had turned 15 a mere two weeks earlier and had never been in trouble with the law, Marc would be formally indicted as an adult on seven charges including felony first-degree murder, with its maximum sentence of life behind bars. Also charged separately with third-degree felony murder were the 21-year-old tenant of the apartment where the shooting happened, which police described as a filthy drug den, and Rodriguez, who had turned himself in. Police found an Argentina-made .380 Bersa Thunder handgun and bag of pot on the front seats of his car. Both co-accused would soon be granted bail and later plead out to lesser marijuana drug charges in exchange for boot-camp sentences and probation. The man who admitted to brokering the deal -- he arrived at the scene in his dad's shiny gold Cadillac and fled unhurt when the shooting started -- was never charged.\n\nAt Marc's bail hearing, Dube buried her face in her hands or dabbed at her eyes as investigators described in gruesome detail how her older son had met his violent end. She listened as they described her younger son's arrest, interrogation and confession. And then, as a witness, Dube found herself impugned as a negligent mother who had failed to properly supervise her teenaged offspring. Momentarily combative at one point, she looked the prosecutor in the eye and asked rhetorically: \"You don't have children, do you?\" The judge would later lend an official stamp of approval to the jaundiced view of Dube as a parent by stating that a desperate mother might resort to desperate measures to spare her son a lengthy prison term and, given her status as a diplomat, that made the child a flight risk. In addition, Circuit Court Judge Teresa Pooler decided the mother could not be trusted to supervise him properly. Despite being the only juvenile charged in the case, Marc was the only one denied bail pending trial.\n\n\"My vision for a better world is a world in which greed, jealousy violence etc. does not exist. Where people are not judged by their race...\" Marc had written in a high school essay shortly before the killings. \"This is a world I doubt would ever happen because of human nature.\"\n\n***\n\nAlmost a year later, Dube is still piecing together the shards of her life. At times, she talks with confidence and an unabashed optimism. Other moments, she is clearly close to tears. She stepped down as consul general last August, but remains a Canadian government employee on sick leave. The driver, who allowed her to work en route to the office, is gone, as is the packed schedule of a consul general. She's moved into a more modest rental apartment. The minimally furnished space feels temporary, makeshift, almost empty. \"Everything is completely different,\" she allows. \"Everything has changed.\"\n\nThe unfathomable grief at losing Jean, she says, has begun subsiding. As evidence, she says, she can now look at the many photographs she has of her older son, smile and say to herself, \"Wow, it was a blast for those 18 years.\"\n\n\"I have almost a sense of joy. That he's with me. He's with Marc, and he will live through us. He has managed to tell me somehow that this was meant to happen and he's OK.\"\n\nDealing with the guilt has taken a lot longer.\n\nWhen a child falls ill, the usual reaction from others is one of sympathy. When a child is accused of being a criminal, Dube would soon learn, a more common reaction is that the parents must have somehow failed. It is, she came to understand, a way for other parents to protect themselves, to be able to declare privately that something that awful could never happen to their kids.\n\n\"You really feel the blows,\" she says, growing quiet, her gaze fixed on the living room window overlooking a manicured, suburban lawn.\n\nA counsellor's words offered another revelation: Focus on what she had done right as a mother and show herself compassion for any mistakes she might have made. It was a pivotal turning point on the winding path to healing.\n\n\"It was a very long road to go from 'I am a bad mother' to 'I have made mistakes.' And there's a difference between the two.\"\n\n***\n\nA French-Canadian raised in Quebec, Dube had put herself through university before working for a decade on Parliament Hill for a prominent MP who became foreign affairs minister. Her boys' dad, Germano Wabafiyebazu, was a Congolese refugee who came to Canada in 1992. They met at the University of Ottawa in '93. She was in her early 30s when Jean was born. Marc, the \"son every mother would want to have,\" followed a couple of years later. The photographs spread out on her dining room table show the smiling siblings in various stages of childhood. In most, they sport broad winning smiles, in stark contrast to the perplexed upturned face a taller, gangly Marc would later show as he sat in brown prison garb quietly watching court proceedings.\n\nDube waves her hands as she talks about feeling the need to dig deeper, much deeper, to ask herself what had happened to explain the calamity that had befallen them. Jean had done well in school. He was popular, athletic, smart. She and his father, from whom she separated after her tour as ambassador to Zimbabwe, loved him. They had been strong, supportive, hard-working role models. She had done all the right mom things. She drove him everywhere. They talked. And yet he had drifted into a rougher crowd in Ottawa and had started dabbling in drugs, apparently more with the notion of selling them than using them.\n\n\"He wanted money. He wanted to be rich quickly,\" she says. \"He knew what he was doing.\"\n\nJean had been arrested in Ottawa on a minor drug-possession charge. He talked of dropping out of high school. Dube and his father sat him down to talk about what was happening with him. He agreed to change schools, away from what they considered the bad influence of his older friends. He wept in embarrassment. \"He knew we wanted the best for him,\" she says.\n\nBut there was something yet deeper that Dube now faults herself for not recognizing. She had tried to exercise parental authority by doling out money, by forbidding his unsupervised use of the car _ external things, she calls them. What she might have missed, she says, was the internal: Jean was in the throes of a biracial identity crisis. The son of a black father and white mother, he had started bumping up against the negative views too many people hold of black youth. It destabilized him, she says. Despite what many might see as the wealth of resources available to her, she found it difficult reaching out to family or friends for help in dealing with a troubled, independent-minded son she wanted to protect. In retrospect, she says, she had become isolated as a parent and needed help. She should have done more to find it, she says.\n\n\"He needed help and I needed help,\" she says. \"He could have been saved.\"\n\n***\n\nIronically, Dube has now become a source of wisdom and strength for other parents going through their own versions of child or teenage hell. She has, she believes, become a better mother. She has visited Marc whenever allowed over the past year -- mostly through glass in the juvenile section of an adult prison -- where she was invariably the only white woman among Hispanics and blacks. Everyone, it seems, knows who she is. Despite her own pain, or perhaps because of it, she talks of the strong urge to want to comfort the often bewildered relatives she encounters on visiting days.\n\n\"I want to scream, 'I'm so with you!'\" she says.\n\nDube is acutely aware of the special ridicule reserved for mothers who declare their children \"innocent,\" no matter how heinous their crimes. Jean, she says, most certainly played a crucial role in what happened that fateful March day; he committed a crime, with devastating consequences.\n\n\"You have two young lives, full of talent, full of dreams, who died so unnecessarily for two stupid pounds of marijuana,\" she sighs.\n\nOn the other hand, she insists, Marc was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He knows he should not have been there. He has taken responsibility for his role, she says. But what's equally clear is that he did not commit murder or even an armed robbery. \"He did not participate in the felony. He was sitting in the car in the passenger seat, no means of communicating with his brother, unarmed.\"\n\nStill, rather than submit to the vagaries of a trial at which his co-accused would testify against him, and the potentially severe consequences of a conviction, Marc pleaded no contest on Friday to four charges, including two counts of third-degree felony murder -- one for his brother's death -- as well as aggravated battery. From her seat below a sign reading, \"We who labour here seek only truth,\" and after grilling Dube on whether she would properly supervise her son, Judge Pooler accepted the plea along with the jointly recommended sentence of boot camp, modified house arrest and up to eight years of probation. Crucially, if he completes the sentence without incident, he will have no criminal conviction.\n\n\"Essentially, he is paying the price for Jean. He is also pleading to the murder of his own brother,\" Dube says.\n\n***\n\nIt's been tough, Dube says reflectively. She still doesn't have her car back from police. Her surviving son is still not home. But Marc, who once told her they would get through the ordeal one day at a time, has been doing well, although forced to grow up faster than they might have wished. In his fellow inmates, he has seen first-hand the consequences of parental neglect, abuse and cripplingly broken homes. He speaks with compassion about them, she says. If she has grown as a mother, so has her son. They have started looking forward to the day when they can put this tragic chapter of their lives behind them and really start to move on, to rebuild, although exactly how and where is not clear. The no-contest plea and conditional sentence, at least, has allowed for more certainty.\n\nJean is long buried in Ottawa. He was, his mom says, fiercely protective of his only sibling. At Marc's request, his tombstone carries the epitaph:", "The unease Canada's top diplomat in Miami was feeling as her car threaded its way to work that bright, warm early morning was becoming more insistent.\n\nHer phone rang.\n\n\"Are your kids OK?\" a senior official at Canada's Embassy in Washington was asking.\n\n\"And then,\" Roxanne Dube says in her French-accented lilt, \"I knew something was not correct.\"\n\nAs she would later discover, local authorities had contacted the U.S. State Department, which had in turn contacted the Canadian Embassy.

At times, she talks with confidence and an unabashed optimism. Other moments, she is clearly close to tears. She stepped down as consul general last August, but remains a Canadian government employee on sick leave. The driver, who allowed her to work en route to the office, is gone, as is the packed schedule of a consul general. She's moved into a more modest rental apartment. The minimally furnished space feels temporary, makeshift, almost empty. \"Everything is completely different,\" she allows. \"Everything has changed.\"\n\nThe unfathomable grief at losing Jean, she says, has begun subsiding. As evidence, she says, she can now look at the many photographs she has of her older son, smile and say to herself, \"Wow, it was a blast for those 18 years.\"\n\n\"I have almost a sense of joy. That he's with me. He's with Marc, and he will live through us. He has managed to tell me somehow that this was meant to happen and he's OK.\"\n\nDealing with the guilt has taken a lot longer.\n\nWhen a child falls ill, the usual reaction from others is one of sympathy. When a child is accused of being a criminal, Dube would soon learn, a more common reaction is that the parents must have somehow failed. It is, she came to understand, a way for other parents to protect themselves, to be able to declare privately that something that awful could never happen to their kids.\n\n\"You really feel the blows,\" she says, growing quiet, her gaze fixed on the living room window overlooking a manicured, suburban lawn.\n\nA counsellor's words offered another revelation: Focus on what she had done right as a mother and show herself compassion for any mistakes she might have made. It was a pivotal turning point on the winding path to healing.\n\n\"It was a very long road to go from 'I am a bad mother' to 'I have made mistakes.' And there's a difference between the two.\"\n\n***\n\nA French-Canadian raised in Quebec, Dube had put herself through university before working for a decade on Parliament Hill for a prominent MP who became foreign affairs minister. Her boys' dad, Germano Wabafiyebazu, was a Congolese refugee who came to Canada in 1992. They met at the University of Ottawa in '93. She was in her early 30s when Jean was born. Marc, the \"son every mother would want to have,\" followed a couple of years later. The photographs spread out on her dining room table show the smiling siblings in various stages of childhood. In most, they sport broad winning smiles, in stark contrast to the perplexed upturned face a taller, gangly Marc would later show as he sat in brown prison garb quietly watching court proceedings.\n\nDube waves her hands as she talks about feeling the need to dig deeper, much deeper, to ask herself what had happened to explain the calamity that had befallen them. Jean had done well in school. He was popular, athletic, smart. She and his father, from whom she separated after her tour as ambassador to Zimbabwe, loved him. They had been strong, supportive, hard-working role models. She had done all the right mom things. She drove him everywhere. They talked. And yet he had drifted into a rougher crowd in Ottawa and had started dabbling in drugs, apparently more with the notion of selling them than using them.\n\n\"He wanted money. He wanted to be rich quickly,\" she says. \"He knew what he was doing.\"\n\nJean had been arrested in Ottawa on a minor drug-possession charge. He talked of dropping out of high school. Dube and his father sat him down to talk about what was happening with him. He agreed to change schools, away from what they considered the bad influence of his older friends. He wept in embarrassment. \"He knew we wanted the best for him,\" she says.\n\nBut there was something yet deeper that Dube now faults herself for not recognizing. She had tried to exercise parental authority by doling out money, by forbidding his unsupervised use of the car _ external things, she calls them. What she might have missed, she says, was the internal: Jean was in the throes of a biracial identity crisis. The son of a black father and white mother, he had started bumping up against the negative views too many people hold of black youth. It destabilized him, she says. Despite what many might see as the wealth of resources available to her, she found it difficult reaching out to family or friends for help in dealing with a troubled, independent-minded son she wanted to protect. In retrospect, she says, she had become isolated as a parent and needed help. She should have done more to find it, she says.\n\n\"He needed help and I needed help,\" she says. \"He could have been saved.\"\n\n***\n\nIronically, Dube has now become a source of wisdom and strength for other parents going through their own versions of child or teenage hell. She has, she believes, become a better mother. She has visited Marc whenever allowed over the past year - mostly through glass in the juvenile section of an adult prison - where she was invariably the only white woman among Hispanics and blacks. Everyone, it seems, knows who she is. Despite her own pain, or perhaps because of it, she talks of the strong urge to want to comfort the often bewildered relatives she encounters on visiting days.\n\n\"I want to scream, 'I'm so with you!'\" she says.\n\nDube is acutely aware of the special ridicule reserved for mothers who declare their children \"innocent,\" no matter how heinous their crimes. Jean, she says, most certainly played a crucial role in what happened that fateful March day; he committed a crime, with devastating consequences.\n\n\"You have two young lives, full of talent, full of dreams, who died so unnecessarily for two stupid pounds of marijuana,\" she sighs.\n\nOn the other hand, she insists, Marc was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He knows he should not have been there. He has taken responsibility for his role, she says. But what's equally clear is that he did not commit murder or even an armed robbery. \"He did not participate in the felony. He was sitting in the car in the passenger seat, no means of communicating with his brother, unarmed.\"\n\nStill, rather than submit to the vagaries of a trial at which his co-accused would testify against him, and the potentially severe consequences of a conviction, Marc pleaded no contest on Friday to four charges, including two counts of third-degree felony murder - one for his brother's death - as well as aggravated battery. From her seat below a sign reading, \"We who labour here seek only truth,\" and after grilling Dube on whether she would properly supervise her son, Judge Pooler accepted the plea along with the jointly recommended sentence of boot camp, modified house arrest and up to eight years of probation. Crucially, if he completes the sentence without incident, he will have no criminal conviction.\n\n\"Essentially, he is paying the price for Jean. He is also pleading to the murder of his own brother,\" Dube says.\n\n***\n\nIt's been tough, Dube says reflectively. She still doesn't have her car back from police. Her surviving son is still not home. But Marc, who once told her they would get through the ordeal one day at a time, has been doing well, although forced to grow up faster than they might have wished. In his fellow inmates, he has seen first-hand the consequences of parental neglect, abuse and cripplingly broken homes. He speaks with compassion about them, she says. If she has grown as a mother, so has her son. They have started looking forward to the day when they can put this tragic chapter of their lives behind them and really start to move on, to rebuild, although exactly how and where is not clear. The no-contest plea and conditional sentence, at least, has allowed for more certainty.\n\nJean is long buried in Ottawa. He was, his mom says, fiercely protective of his only sibling. At Marc's request, his tombstone carries the epitaph:", "The unease Canada's top diplomat in Miami was feeling as her car threaded its way to work that bright, warm early morning was becoming more insistent.\n\nHer phone rang.\n\n\"Are your kids OK?\" a senior official at Canada's Embassy in Washington was asking.\n\n\"And then,\" Roxanne Dube says in her French-accented lilt, \"I knew something was not correct.\"\n\nAs she would later discover, local authorities had contacted the U.S. State Department, which had in turn contacted the Canadian Embassy. Her unease turned to alarm as, at the urging of her embassy contact, she directed her driver to a hospital, where she was ushered into a VIP room. Someone handed her a piece of paper with a phone number to call for information. She did.\n\n\"I'm afraid I have bad news, I think we should meet,\" Det. Rolando Garcia was saying. \"And he said: 'Jean is dead.' I knew it was true because of the way he pronounced Jean's name.\"\n\nDube dropped the phone. Her world had imploded that sunny day on March 31, 2015. Dube could barely stagger outside.\n\nNow 53, Dube had arrived from Ottawa with her two teen sons exactly two months earlier to take up her post as Canada's consul general in Miami. It had been a whirlwind of wrapping up her old job - she had been director general for North America, helping oversee Canada's consular network in the U.S. and Mexico - finding housing, moving, unpacking, getting the boys settled in school.\n\n\"I needed a wife, basically,\" she says. \"That's what I needed. It was very demanding.\"\n\n***\n\nDube had thought little of it when her 18-year-old son, Jean Wabafiyebazu, had asked for money to buy a textbook and take his younger brother, Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, to a restaurant and movie. The older teen had been doing well and she thought he could do with a reward. She gave him $80 and allowed them to use her black BMW, its diplomatic licence plate sporting the word \"Consul,\" because Jean's car, which she now drives, was in the shop that day. Instead, that March 30 afternoon, the brothers headed to a dingy apartment, Jean's math homework in a black Jansport backpack on the back seat. He was carrying an American-made .40 calibre Smith and Wesson handgun. His plan, police would allege, was to rob a drug dealer of about 800 grams of marijuana.\n\nJean left Marc sitting in the passenger seat, nearby trees waving in the breeze, as he went into the apartment clutching a green duffel bag emblazoned with a Moosehead beer logo and the words Jean/Marc written in fading ink. Inside, Jean and Anthony Rodriguez, then 19, had a back and forth, according to court evidence, along the lines of, \"Show me the money,\" \"Show me the drugs.\" And then, it went horribly wrong. Within minutes, Jean and another teen, Joshua Wright, 17, had died in an exchange of gunfire. Jean had been shot three times, including in the head. Rodriguez, a bullet wound to his arm, would tell police that he picked up a handgun as he bolted into the sunshine, stopping only to rush back inside to retrieve his drugs. His green iPhone was left inside in a pool of blood.\n\nOutside, an agitated and distraught Marc Wabafiyebazu, who had tried in vain to get some answers from the fleeing dealer, could only watch as Rodriguez drove off to abandon his silver Chevy Malibu at a gas station - the same place he had been arrested a month earlier with a loaded gun for drug trafficking. Police had released him without charge two weeks before Jean's death. Minutes after the dealer's hasty exit, police ordered Marc to his knees and arrested him on the sidewalk as they swarmed the bloody, casing-riddled crime scene.\n\nFor hours, Marc was left in an interrogation room, handcuffed to a chair. No one read him his rights or warned him about the perils of speaking to the officers. Investigators refused his pleas to call his mother, who would go to bed about 10 p.m. that night wondering why she couldn't reach her kids, but assuming their phone batteries had died or that they were in a movie theatre and had turned their devices off.\n\nIn court the following day, the judge gave Dube, now stricken with the knowledge her older son was dead, 30 seconds to hug her bereft, defeated younger son.\n\n\"He said, 'Jean est mort, Jean est mort.' And I said, 'We're going to be brave now',\" she says. \"I couldn't grieve for Jean at that point. There was no space.\"\n\nMost pressing for Dube was ensuring that Marc survived. The brothers had developed an extraordinarily close bond through his mother's various postings and moves, including a stint as ambassador to Zimbabwe that began in 2005. More of a pliant follower, Marc kept saying he didn't know if he could live without his brother. In the gloom of the courtroom that day, Dube realized she had to shape up for her boy's sake.\n\n***\n\nNeither police nor prosecutors would allege Marc shot or even threatened anyone. Surveillance video at the two-storey apartment complex backs that up. But based on a purported confession he gave over a couple of minutes from the back seat of a cruiser to a rookie officer who was driving, police alleged Marc was in on his brother's planned armed robbery of the drug dealer. \"He says, 'It was a job gone wrong. I know you're a police officer but everyone is going to talk, so I may as well talk',\" Officer Juan Velez testified the accused told him. Marc, the officer testified, also said he and his brother had done such ripoffs before in Ottawa. Dube, however, is adamant that Marc said something quite different: That while Jean might have done something like that, he himself had never done so. Nevertheless, police argued, Marc had now confessed to being a party to the botched robbery and hence was, under Florida's felony law, culpable in the killings.\n\n\"These brothers know the business. They know what they're buying,\" prosecutor Marie Mato declared. \"(Marc) didn't even have to be there at all, but the fact is that he was. He was there to assist his brother in the rip.\"\n\n***\n\nEven though he had turned 15 a mere two weeks earlier and had never been in trouble with the law, Marc would be formally indicted as an adult on seven charges including felony first-degree murder, with its maximum sentence of life behind bars. Also charged separately with third-degree felony murder were the 21-year-old tenant of the apartment where the shooting happened, which police described as a filthy drug den, and Rodriguez, who had turned himself in. Police found an Argentina-made .380 Bersa Thunder handgun and bag of pot on the front seats of his car. Both co-accused would soon be granted bail and later plead out to lesser marijuana drug charges in exchange for boot-camp sentences and probation. The man who admitted to brokering the deal - he arrived at the scene in his dad's shiny gold Cadillac and fled unhurt when the shooting started - was never charged.\n\nAt Marc's bail hearing, Dube buried her face in her hands or dabbed at her eyes as investigators described in gruesome detail how her older son had met his violent end. She listened as they described her younger son's arrest, interrogation and confession. And then, as a witness, Dube found herself impugned as a negligent mother who had failed to properly supervise her teenaged offspring. Momentarily combative at one point, she looked the prosecutor in the eye and asked rhetorically: \"You don't have children, do you?\" The judge would later lend an official stamp of approval to the jaundiced view of Dube as a parent by stating that a desperate mother might resort to desperate measures to spare her son a lengthy prison term and, given her status as a diplomat, that made the child a flight risk. In addition, Circuit Court Judge Teresa Pooler decided the mother could not be trusted to supervise him properly. Despite being the only juvenile charged in the case, Marc was the only one denied bail pending trial.\n\n\"My vision for a better world is a world in which greed, jealousy violence etc. does not exist. Where people are not judged by their race\"|\" Marc had written in a high school essay shortly before the killings. \"This is a world I doubt would ever happen because of human nature.\"\n\n***\n\nAlmost a year later, Dube is still piecing together the shards of her life.

Fingers crossed.", "Presidential candidate Donald Trump's prediction that in five years Boeing's S. Carolina jobs could all be shipped to China shows a lack of understanding of the airplane business, experts said. Also, Tim's Cascade marks 30 years of churning out potato chips.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump warned South Carolina audiences this past week that Boeing's prized manufacturing complex in their state could soon be gone, its 7,500 jobs shipped off because \"it will be cheaper to build in China.\"\n\nPeople with a better grasp of the airplane business don't share Trump's concern.\n\n\"I think he's somewhat badly confused about our industry,\" said Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group consulting firm outside Washington D.C. \"If anything there's a trend toward insourcing, moving work back to the U.S.\"\n\nAnother leading aviation observer, Adam Pilarski of Avitas, agreed: \"The whole thing appeals to people who have absolutely, totally no idea about the industry... It's absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nTrump's appearance Feb. 17 in Walterboro, S.C., put him about 50 miles northwest of Boeing's growing industrial complex in North Charleston.\n\nWhat he told the crowd, according to CSPAN's video of the Feb. 17 event:\n\n\"Boeing just had a big order from China, but China is making them build a massive airline facility, right? Massive, like bigger than anything you've seen. You feel good about Boeing right now? Tell me in five years...\"\n\n\"They are going to build that plant, they are going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you're gonna be reading a big front-page story, all over the place, that Boeing is going to leave South Carolina, they're going to make all their planes in China. Because that's what they do.\n\n\"And our leaders aren't smart enough to stop it, OK?\"\n\nOn the other hand, Trump added, if he's president, \"You'll be fine, don't worry about it.\"\n\nAt a later rally right in North Charleston, he doubled down on his dire scenario, according to the local Post and Courier:\n\n\"It will be cheaper to build in China,\" he said. \"Then all of a sudden your Boeing plant in this area will be gone, and we don't want that to happen. And a politician will never be able to stop it. Because they're all talk and no action. They don't have a clue.\"\n\nAboulafia called Trump's scenario of moving airplane manufacturing to China \"bizarre.\"\n\nBoeing did agree in November to establish an interior finishing plant in China where things such as seats will be installed in 737s before they are painted and delivered to Chinese airline customers.\n\nBut unlike Airbus, which is doing final assembly on single-aisle planes in China, \"Boeing gave them some paint work that was embarrassingly trumped up, exaggerated,\" Aboulafia said dismissively.\n\nNobody should be worried that the company gave away any \"strategic carpet-stapling capabilities,\" he joked.\n\nPilarski noted that industries that pursue the lowest-wage workforce are now leaving China in favor of nations such as Vietnam. More importantly, he said, \"In aviation, cheap labor is not the major element because you need technical skills and so on.\"\n\nBoeing's North Charleston complex is proof that outsourcing major aircraft structures and opening new factories is hardly a surefire strategy. On the heavily outsourced 787 Dreamliner, the company was forced to buy out its major supplier partners in South Carolina.

The businessman candidate said that if he were president, he would slap a 35 percent tax on the company's air conditioners shipped back to the U.S.\n\nIt's not clear how the growing number of South Carolina factory workers who are employed by foreign companies may react to Trump's economic nationalism.\n\nFor instance, 100 miles from Walterboro is Camden, where appliance manufacturer Haier became the first Chinese company to open a U.S. factory. Last summer it announced plans to add 410 jobs as it nearly doubles the size of its plant, which makes refrigerators and freezers.\n\nAnd another 125 miles down the road is Spartanburg, S.C., where BMW in 2014 declared it would spend $1 billion to double its capacity, creating the German carmaker's largest factory worldwide.

Kennedy retired in 2005 and sold the company to Birds Eye Foods.\n\nThe flavor did well but the company decided to cycle the flavor out, as it does periodically with some flavors.\n\nThey decided to bring it back for the anniversary because \"it's a fun one,\" Leichleiter said. And \"it's just in time for spring training and barbecues.\"\n\nOver the years the company, which has grown to employ 105 people and uses some 40 million pounds of potatoes a year, has brought out \"special batch\" limited edition flavors each year.\n\nThis year, in addition to the Coney Island flavor, the company is introducing Hawaiian Island Lemon.\n\nWhy lemon-flavored potato chips?\n\n\"It's kind of trendy,\" especially in the food service business where these types of trends start out, Leichleiter said.\n\nThe company has found that different flavors appeal to different parts of the country.\n\nFor instance, a barbecue chip is not just a barbecue chip. Texans prefer a Mesquite barbecue flavor while Pacific Northwesterners prefer a wood smoked, less salty flavor -- resulting in different barbecue flavors named after different regions.\n\nTim's Cascade Snacks is now a subsidiary of Parsippany, N.J.-based Pinnacle Foods. For the quarter ended Sept. 27, 2015, Pinnacle reported that its specialty foods division, which includes Tim's, saw net sales decline 13.9 percent to $82.2 million.

Wabafiyebazu, the 15-year-old son of a Canadian diplomat charged with first degree murder in a double killing in Miami, is expected to plead guilty to reduced charges Friday. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Walter Michot/The Miami Herald via AP, Pool)\n\nAlmost one year on, Canada's former consul general to Miami is still piecing together the shards of a life shattered by the killing of her teenaged son and the grave charges laid against her other boy.\n\nThe grief she says at losing Jean Wabafiyebazu, 18, has begun subsiding. Dealing with her guilt has taken longer.\n\n\"It was a very long road to go from 'I am a bad mother' to 'I have made mistakes,'\" Roxanne Dube told The Canadian Press during a recent interview in her rented Miami bungalow. \"There's a difference between the two.\"\n\nNow 53, Dube stepped down as consul general last August after Jean and another teenager died in a hail of gunfire in a dingy Miami-area apartment. Outside, his brother Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, was waiting in their mother's car.\n\nDube had thought little of it when Jean had asked for money to buy a textbook and take Marc to a restaurant and movie. The older teen had been doing well and she thought he could do with a reward. She loaned him her black BMW, with its diplomatic licence plates, because his car, which she now drives, was in the shop.\n\nInstead, that March 30 afternoon, the brothers headed to the apartment to meet a pot dealer. Jean was carrying a loaded handgun. His plan, police would allege, was to rob the dealer of about 800 grams of marijuana.\n\n\"I didn't know Jean was capable of carrying a gun and entering an apartment and doing drug-trafficking, let alone to steal,\" said Dube, who remains a Canadian government employee on sick leave.\n\nJean left Marc sitting in the passenger seat when he went into the apartment, where the situation went horribly wrong. Within minutes, Jean and Joshua Wright, 17, would die in an exchange of gunfire. Outside, a distraught Marc was arrested. Investigators refused his repeated pleas to call his mom, who would go to bed that night wondering why she couldn't reach her kids by phone.\n\nIt became clearer early the next morning.\n\nAn anxious Dube was on her way to work when a friend at the Canadian embassy in Washington \u00e2\u0080\" alerted by the U.S. State Department, who had been contacted by local authorities \u00e2\u0080\" called to ask if her kids were OK, then directed her to a local hospital. Her unease turned to dread, then horror when the hospital advised her to call police and a detective told her by phone that Jean was dead and Marc was in custody.\n\nIn court, the judge gave the grief-stricken mother 30 seconds to hug her bereft, defeated son, who kept saying: \"Jean est mort. Jean est mort.\"\n\nAt that moment, she said, she knew she had to shape up \u00e2\u0080\" for Marc's sake. \"I couldn't grieve for Jean at that point. There was no space.\"\n\nWhen a child falls ill, people generally react sympathetically. When a child is accused of being a criminal, Dube would soon learn, a common reaction is that, somehow, the parents must have failed.", "As a buyer, a vehicle's safety rating is a crucial and complex component to consider. It concerns not only physical equipment, but also a car's performance in challenging environments.\n\nWith this in mind, AxleGeeks sought to identify the most dangerous car brands by looking at IIHS and NHTSA safety ratings.\n\nAdditionally, AxleGeeks examined the safety features offered across model lines, including blind-spot monitoring, pre-collision and post-collision safety systems, rearview camera, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning systems.\n\nTies were broken based on the percentage of model lines with an IIHS Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick+ award.\n\nA mere 3.4 percent of BMW's models earned IIHS honors, a considerably low score when compared with the 7.8 percent average per lineup of Germany luxury brands. However, 20.7 percent of its vehicles received a five-star NHTSA overall rating, giving it a slight edge over the 16.9 percent standard per lineup of its competitors.\n\nWhile 37.9 percent of BMW's models feature adaptive cruise control, compared to an average 45.5 percent among other German luxury brands, BMW fails to deliver blind-spot monitoring and collision safety systems.\n\nOnly 5.6 percent of Mercedes-Benz's models received an NHTSA overall five-star rating. By comparison, German luxury brands averaged 16.9 percent with five-star overall ratings. However, the IIHS awarded 11.1 percent of its models with safety awards, a slight jump from the average of its competitors, which stands at 7.8 percent per lineup.\n\nThe manufacturer falls behind its competitors in its safety features as well: Only 8.3 percent of Mercedes-Benz model lines feature blind-spot monitoring, while German luxury brands average 17.5 percent across their model lines. Pre- and post-collision safety systems, however, are more commonly found in Mercedes-Benz vehicles than among its competitors (5.6 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively), though they remain rare features.\n\nApproximately 42 percent of Cadillac's model lineups achieved a five-star NHTSA overall rating, a fall from the 48.5 percent standard per lineup of American luxury brands. Furthermore, Cadillac equips fewer vehicles with safety features such as a rearview camera, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control than its American luxury brand competitors.\n\nThough Jeep doesn't possess the safety ratings of Subaru or Volvo, it stands out among other American non-luxury brands: Jeep equips 28.6 percent of its vehicles with a post-collision safety system, while the average for American non-luxury brands with this capability is 21.1 percent.\n\nGMC falls behind its fellow American non-luxury brands: Only 15.8 percent of its vehicles received a five-star NHTSA overall rating while an average of 32.7 percent of American non-luxury model lineups earned the same rating. The IIHS ratings further illustrate this: A mere 10.5 percent of GMC's vehicles earned IIHS honors while the average per lineup of its competitors was 16.4 percent.\n\nJust over 44 percent of Mitsubishi's models received IIHS awards, a fall from the 47.1 percent average per lineup of Japanese luxury brands. Furthermore, Mitsubishi equips only 11.1 percent of its vehicles with a pre-collision safety system, whereas the average of all Japanese non-luxury brands that have this capability is 21.4 percent.\n\nOnly 10.3 percent of Nissan's models achieved a five-star NHTSA overall rating, placing it well below the 38.6 percent per lineup standard of other Japanese non-luxury brands. Additionally, 25.7 percent of its models earned IIHS accolades while its competitors averaged 47.1 percent per lineup.\n\nA mere 16.7 percent of Ram's models received a five-star overall NHTSA safety rating, a far fall from the rates of its competitors like Ford and GMC. However, it equips more of its models with great safety features: Over 38 percent of its vehicles come with a post-collision safety system, while American non-luxury brands with this feature average 21.1 percent.\n\nJaguar falls far behind its luxury brand competitors, including Acura, Infiniti and Lincoln, for its lack of safety features and credentials -- only 14.3 percent of its vehicles feature adaptive cruise control while the average per lineup of all British luxury brands with this capability is 20 percent.\n\nMini earns the title as the most dangerous car brand, as only 10 percent of its 2015-2016 lineup received IIHS awards. By comparison, the average per lineup of non-luxury brands earning IIHS honors is 30.6 percent.\n\nIts models lack blind spot monitoring and pre-collision safety systems; only 10 percent of its models feature post-collision safety features, while 16.3 percent of all non-luxury brands boast this component.", "MIAMI - A Canadian diplomat's teenage son will attend a military-style boot camp and serve up to eight years' probation under a plea agreement approved Friday that spares him a lengthy prison sentence for his role in a drug-related shootout that killed his older brother and another teenager.\n\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler accepted the deal worked out by prosecutor Marie Mato and Curt Obront, the attorney for 15-year-old Marc Wabafiyebazu.

But she and her ex-husband, whom she describes as a loving and supportive father, sat the youth down, persuaded him to change schools, to clean up his act. Jean had wept with embarrassment, she said.\n\nThere's no doubt, she said, that he committed a crime that day in Miami -- with devastating consequences.\n\n\"You have two young lives, full of talent, full of dreams, who died so unnecessarily for two stupid pounds of marijuana,'' she said.\n\nOn the other hand, she insisted, Marc was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. He knows he should not have been there and has taken responsibility for his limited role, she said. But what's equally clear is that he did not kill or even threaten anyone.\n\n\"He did not participate in the felony. He was sitting in the car in the passenger seat, no means of communicating with his brother, unarmed.''\n\nPhotos of Marc Wabafiyebazu, left, and his brother Jean, right, are shown at their mother's home on Feb. 4, 2016 during an interview in Miami. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nStill, rather than submit to the vagaries of a trial and the potentially severe consequences of a conviction -- two co-accused agreed to testify against him and plead guilty to minor drug charges in exchange for bootcamp and probation sentences -- Marc Wabafiyebazu pleaded no contest on Friday to four charges, including two counts of 3rd-degree felony murder.\n\nIn exchange, the court handed down what is essentially a conditional sentence: boot camp, community supervision, and up to eight years of probation.\n\n\"Marc has his future,'' Dube told The Canadian Press after the plea terms were finalized. \"He's going to be saved.''\n\nNow living in a cheaper rental in Miami, Dube still doesn't have her car back. Her surviving child has yet to come home. But Marc has been doing well, and they have started looking forward to the day they can put the tragic chapter of their lives behind them and truly move on. At the very least, she said, she can now look at photographs of her dead boy and smile.\n\n\"It goes away eventually,'' she said of the grief.\n\n\"I have almost a sense of joy. That he's with me. He's with Marc, and he will live through us. He has managed to tell me somehow that this was meant to happen and he's OK.''", "The BMW M2 has been road tested by a number of automotive publications following its debut at the Detroit auto show.\n\nExperts had been worried about how the car would perform given the lukewarm reception given to the standard 2-series. The M performance version is tuned up by BMW engineers to improve performance.\n\nMotor Trend so impressed by the BMW M2 that it gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating. The publication said that the M2 exceeded its expectations. It was especially impressed by the choice of engine, with BMW using a single-turbo engine also seen in the M235i but with pistons from the S55.\n\nAccording to Motor Trend, the choice allows the M2 to \"sing like a BMW should.\" The unit produces 365 horsepower and 343 lf/ft of torque, which are impressive figures.\n\nHowever the publiction also said that the BMW M2 was \"shockingly overweight.\" The criticism has also been leveled at the standard 2 series. By way of comparison the M2 weighs just 100 pounds less than the larger M4.\n\nThat does not mean that the car doesn't move, with performance still strong. The BMW M2 gets from 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds and takes 12.8 seconds to reach 107.5 mph over a quarter mile. These figures put the M2 in similar territory to the M4.\n\nMotor Trends believes that the M2 is \"far more entertaining\" than its larger cousin, and even called it a \"worthy successor\" to the 1 Series M Coupe. SlashGear was also impressed with the car, with pricing a particular strong point.\n\nThe M2 starts at $51,700, which is around $14,000 less than the M4 Coupe. SlashGear called it \"super responsive\" and praised the fact that its power lets you \"whip around a tight bend or throttle out of a turn.\"\n\nOther reviewers praised its track performance. PCWorld reviewer Jon Phillips even went so far as to say that the BMW M2 should be a track-only vehicle. \"I suggest you only drive it to, on, and from race tracks,\" he wrote. \"Beyond that, keep it garaged, and in the most pristine condition possible. It's a marvelous track toy, and 50 years from now, when the rest of America has abandoned automobiles for road-going gondolas, you'll still have one of history's funnest (and most flickable) cars.\"", "This week's automotive aberrations include liability lies, age concern, parking madness, rising damp, surplus cylinders and many more that could not be accommodated elsewhere.\n\nAs usual, emails to Honest John should be addressed to: letters@honestjohn.co.uk Please try to keep them as short as possible.\n\nMy brother is in the process of buying a 5-year old Fiesta Titanium auto, immaculate condition, 20k miles, from a Ford dealer for his wife. However, they will only give 3-month warranty. I thought they had to give 6 months?\n\nGB, Edgware\n\nNo. The dealer remains responsible for any major fault that may have been present or developing on the date of sale for 6 months, but that is not the same as giving a warranty. An insured warranty cannot legally cover anything that predated the warranty being taken out.\n\nI have been looking to buy a new Mazda 6 for the last 5 weeks and following negotiation agreed and signed paperwork and paid in full yesterday. When I studied the paperwork more closely at home it seems that the car may have been manufactured in 2013. Had I known that, I would never have agreed as I think that it has been sitting around too long. From the start I was interested in a new car. No mention was ever made of an older car. I feel I have been duped. Any advice would be appreciated and thank you for your time.\n\nMB, via email\n\nThere were significant updates to the Mazda 6 from February 2015, when it acquired an electric parking brake, a quieter ride and lighter, less satisfying steering. But if you have been sold a 2013 as new in late 2015, unless it was significantly discounted you need to secure either a substantial discount of \u00a33,000 or more on list price or your money back.\n\nI have been sent a parking notice from Lidl's car park on Christmas Eve when I did my shopping at Lidls. I was actually in the store for an \"overstay\", which I didn't know existed until I received the penalty for 38 minutes. I think it is atrocious to charge someone this amount for using a supermarket car park. What can I do about it?\n\nLH, via email\n\nUnfortunately, if the parking period and terms are clearly posted at the carpark, The Supreme Court ruled on 4th November 2015 that the carpark operator is entitled to demand a \"reasonable\" penalty for an overstay. You are therefore legally obliged to pay. I tried to warn the public about Clause 56 of the Protection of Freedoms Act that covers private parking penalties for 2 years before it became law in October 2012 but no-one paid any attention. The chart shows how the income of private parking enforcers rose between 2006 and 2014.\n\nI am writing as I have just received a parking charge notice from Smart Parking. I parked in the Ashdown Road car park in Kingston on 20th December 2015. I parked in a proper bay. The machine nearest to my car was broken, so I walked to the machines in the same carpark by the entrance, joined a long queue of people in the same predicament, and bought a ticket from the only machine working: the one on the far left. I remember this clearly as there were loads of people and also because I was unable to pay with a card as that option wasn't available so my mum and I between us had to scrabble round in our bags to find the right amount of coins and so I paid cash. I then walked back to my car and displayed the ticket clearly while parking. My mum and I kept to the time allowance and did not return late to collect my car. I want to challenge this notice as it feels like a scam as the company is now saying I have to prove I paid. I have looked in my car and I am unfortunately unable to find the ticket. Is there an obligation to keep car park machine tickets after you have left the car park site? There must be hundreds of people similarly affected by this. One other point I'd like to make is that on the notice there are 2 video photos showing the time my car went into and out of the carpark. However, this does not relate realistically to the time I was actually parked and, as it was very busy, I had to wait to get a space, and the machine at the end where I found a parking space wasn't working so I had to wait in line to buy the ticket, walk right across the carpark for a ticket and walk back with it so this will all have taken lots of time.\n\nSP, via email\n\nThe parking period is normally from entry of the carpark to leaving because that is the amount of time you are on the carpark owner's property. You can check the notices. But if on the day it was impossible to find a parking space and get to the machine, you can appeal on the basis of entrapment. Here are the details: /faq/private-parking-penalties/ You may lose because you lost your ticket. Anyone parking anywhere by ticket should always keep the ticket.\n\nRegarding JW's problem with condensation in his little used Focus, there's a very simple and effective solution. Anti-damp desiccant crystals, as used by millions of caravan owners. (They also work very well in our jointly owned light aircraft.) Made by Kilrock, the 'Gel-safe' variety come in a sealed, leak-proof pouch. They cost about \u00a34 for two and are widely available in shops and online. Also, you are spot on about insurers and speed awareness courses. A couple of years ago whilst reading my renewal offer from Admiral (I wrote to you at the time), I noticed they had now included that question. I rang them and they loaded me by 25%. This did me a huge favour as I declined their offer, went to Tesco and saved almost \u00a3200 on my X5 policy (off the original, unloaded quote). I'm still with Tesco and so is my wife's MINI Cooper S. According to a recent article written by a motoring lawyer in one of the motorbike mags, you are also correct in saying you don't have to volunteer information not requested by insurers.\n\nBG, via email\n\nGood suggestion. But no car should be damp inside unless it is leaking, so better to fix the problem rather than leave the car leaking and mitigate its effects. Nevertheless, over winter, those crystals are a good idea for storing a car when condensation from the low temperatures leaves a little moisture inside a car left in an unheated garage.\n\nLocally we have a specialist BMW workshop (in fact, we have two: one in Totton, the other in Christchurch). One of the mechanics working there suggested to me, if buying a BMW, buy one with a 6-cylinder engine. He maintains all the 6 pot engines are infinitely superior to any of the 4 pot engines Interesting? What please is the HJ opinion?\n\nPH, Lyndhurst\n\nThe sixes have been proving more reliable. Nevertheless, I was in a 330D taxi in December and two of its three timing chains had failed at 160k miles. The owner had all 3 replaced for \u00a31,600 and the car is now purring like a kitten. (Smaller N47 and M57 2.0 litre 4 cylinder engines have two chains and the tensioners for the top chains fail. There is currently a partial manufacturer TSB over this issue.)\n\nI have a 2011 Mercedes C200CDI estate car with 36,000 miles and a 2.1 litre diesel engine. I have had the car from new. Never had a moment's trouble with the car, and I drive it hard. However, I now find (after a warning on the dash display) I have to top up the coolant with about a half a pint of water every 1,500 miles. Like my excellent local garage, I cannot find any trace of a leak. Can you help, any ideas?\n\nGW, Lymm\n\nIs it an automatic? If so, the problem could be the transmission heat exchanger installed in the radiator. If coolant is getting into the transmission fluid that could mean big trouble. Otherwise, it could be an airlock and the way to purge that is to take the pressure cap off the coolant reservoir, run the engine up to temperature until the thermostat opens and the cooling fan starts turning, watch the level as it bubbles and gurgles, top it up with coolant, then re-seal. There is also a possibility of a hidden leak from the waterpump or a leak via the EGR cooler that ends up in the exhaust system.\n\nWhat you have taught me finally sunk in. This time around for a car change I did not need to email you for advice, I used my brain and your web page. I looked at roughly what I wanted, read your reviews. Couldn't think of any good reason to pay extra for a Golf GTi over an Octavia VRS. Test-drove. Got a price from the local dealer inc. P/X. Looked online at what I could get the car for and what mine should be worth. Realised the local dealer was way off (no discount off list and poor P/X). Approached John Robertson at www.new-car-discount.com/ (I had bought from him before a few years ago), Offered me \u00a3500 more than the dealer for P/X but also quite happy if I sold privately between factory order and delivery (3 months). So I sold privately the day before the new car arrived and made a few \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 extra. Car arrived on the back of a single transporter straight from the dealer - 5 miles on the clock. Now proud owner of 65 plate Skoda Octavia 2.0 TSi VRS hatch. List price was \u00a324,100 I paid \u00a319,155 saving \u00a34,945 saving 20.5%. It's a great car, very capable, very practical, and very, very fast.\n\nMA, via email\n\nThat's excellent. Puts http://www.new-car-discount.com/ back on the list. Assuming you did get immediate 'keepership' of the car? Not a 6 month wait for the V5C?\n\nI am starting a small business and need to buy a small van. I want to buy new, but am struggling to come up with something that will be reliable, but also cool. Any ideas?\n\nTC, via email\n\nThe best is probably the new Transit Courier. That's the smallest (Fiesta size) of four sizes of Transit and you can get a Tourneo version with windows in the rear sides (http://vans.honestjohn.co.uk/van-reviews/ford/tourneo-courier-2014/). A retro Nissan S-Cargo is getting a bit old to be 100% reliable.\n\nAfter reading many used car horror stories in your column, I thought I would pass on a more positive one. With some reservations, my daughter bought a MINI coming to the end of its 3 year warranty from an independent dealer, 4 hours away, that said it traded on reputation (The Driving Range in Bridgend). Car soon showed a warning light for abnormal battery discharge and local MINI dealership recommended a new battery (not covered by MINI warranty). Driving Range paid their bill direct and then, when a few delays later that fix didn't work and a failed Tracker was found to be the cause, necessitating a 3 hour job to remove the dashboard and Tracker, that was also settled directly with no dispute at all. No need to mention legal obligations just a nice stress-free resolution. Would that all motor traders were the same.\n\nPT, via email\n\nThey merely conformed with the law. But the fact they did so promptly and without question says a lot for them and means that they will deservedly gain reputation and customers.\n\nI've watched your reviews on YouTube. I want to sell my 1985 Mercedes 190 and was hoping you would have some tips on the best places to advertise to a collector. It's a gold 1985 Mercedes 190 manual with only 35,000 miles. Its condition is mint inside and out and it drives like new. Gearshift very smooth. It has beige fake leather with black trim all perfect. It is one owner from new and has 12 months MoT with no advisories. I would be grateful for any help\n\nRS, via email\n\nYou could try markcosovich@btconnect.com at W123World. He's really into W123s but likes 190s and seeks perfection. The 190 specialist dealer is: http://www.mtsv.co.uk/w201.htm\n\nI would be grateful if you would enlighten me on the effects of the VW emissions scandal on a 2013 Audi A6 S-line 2.0 TDI. I have heard that even though this is a very efficient engine with no need for falsification, nevertheless the Vehicle Excise Duty has gone up to the \u00a3400+ level and thousands of pounds has been wiped off the resale value. I do hope that my information is incorrect and that you can set the record straight for me.\n\nJH, Timperley Cheshire\n\nWhere did you hear that? Not true. No increase in VED because that would be illegal, and even if legislation was passed that made it legal, Audi would then be liable for the increased cost for the rest of the car's life. Yes, used values will have softened a bit because the shine has gone off VAG's reputation. But the software will be updated later this year and A6 used values will be affected more by the introduction of the new A6 than by anything else.\n\nI have been looking at VW Golf 1.6TDI deals and have seen them through Barnet to Dundee for \u00a3209 per month inc. VAT and entitled to cover 10,000 a year. Do you think it's a good engine and does this seem a good deal for a 2015 car with around 8,000 on the clock?\n\nTJ, via email\n\nThe EA288 1.6TDI is certainly much better than the EA189 1.6TDI that had a lot of EGR trouble as well as being recalled for modifications to solve its NOx emission problem. \u00a3209 a month inc. VAT is very reasonable for this car. It should do 60mpg.\n\nSomeone drove into the side of my car last Saturday. I was on a roundabout; he was waiting to join the roundabout. As I passed him he drove onto the roundabout and hit the rear of my car. He leapt out and started to shout and bawl at me. A police car arrived and took his details and mine. The police stated that he was in the wrong. He should have given way to me because I was on the roundabout and he was about to drive onto it. I told my insurance company within half an hour. Today, Monday 4th January, a company called Kindertons Accident Management telephoned me. They say they have been contacted by Esure, my insurers. They want to discuss a hire car while my car is being repaired. My insurance includes a courtesy car for instances like this. I've been driving since 1963 and never had a bump or an insurance claim, so I don't really know how to handle all this. I know nothing about Kindertons, but having read the Telegraph for 40 years, I've read so much about people \"milking\" accident victims insurance companies resulting in increased premiums I'm wary of cold calls from anybody in these circumstance. Can you offer any advice, please?\n\nPG, Stirling\n\nThis will almost certainly be an accident management company seeking to put you into a credit hire car at a higher than normal rate in order to make money out of the situation. The reason your insurer put them onto you is that it must get a financial interest out of the arrangement. Read your policy document very carefully. If it states you will automatically be entitled to a courtesy car, then refuse the credit hire car and demand a free courtesy car. If it makes a vague promise that could cover a credit hire car then first ask Kindertons the precise charge they will be making for the credit hire car, then check with three different car rental companies in an attempt to get a lower quote. They cannot legally question this because if the other driver's insurer refuses to pay for the credit hire car you will be directly liable for it and if the case goes to court you will find you have been required to \"mitigate\" your expenses.\n\nI am in desperate need of some expert impartial advice please. I have seen what I believe to be a good deal on a 2015 Peugeot 2008 1.6 diesel, top-spec car. The dealer is not budging on price at all. The car is currently at \u00a310,893. Would I be sensible to grab the deal now, or to wait until March before the 16 plates come out? When is the best time of year to buy a used car? I need to act in the next 24hours, though, before the lower 13,000-15,000 mile cars go. My idea had been to buy a 15/65 plate in March once the new 16s were out. I do not want a 'new' car. What would your advice be?\n\nCR, via email\n\nCR wrote to me in December 2015. The best time of year to buy a used car at trade price trade is late October, early November. The best time to buy retail could be December if a dealer needs cashflow, but the smart ones have banked on a lot of cars bought cheaply in November to sell expensively in January. If you wait until March you will be buying a new 16 reg, probably for \u00a33k-\u00a34k more than the 15 reg 2008 you have seen, and in a year's time it will be worth \u00a32k - \u00a33k more than the 15 reg you have seen. Depends how much you need a car now. If you need the car now, buy it now. No point in suffering without a car for 3 months for the sake of a few hundred quid. And definitely not worth hiring a car until then.\n\nI have been told that when the weather is very cold and your car engine chatters a bit on starting you should switch it off for a few minutes and start it again to allow the oil to drain back into the system. Is this right or just someone's idea? I find my 25-year old car does make some noise when cold starting, which soon disappears and is then as quiet as new.\n\nMS, Brokenhurst\n\nDoesn't make sense. In the bad old days when I was running what are now called 'classics' with crank handles, I used to crank the engines over a dozen times to circulate some oil before starting them in below zero temperatures. But what you describe would have the effect of washing out the bores with petrol not just once (briefly) on the initial start, but twice so the engine actually starts with the oil washed off the bores. Not a good idea.\n\nWe run a 2014 BMW X3. Up North we got \u00a34k off, but local London dealer just quoted list. We told the dealer we will upgrade once they talk X3 Hybrid delivery dates. The i3/i8 are the right way forward. I guess, when they apply the technology to the heavy X3/X5 brigade they won't cope with demand.\n\nAG, via email\n\nSome plug-in hybrids have small petrol engines: BMW i3, BMW i8. Other plug-ins, such as the new VW Passat GTE, the BMW 330e and the BMW X5 xDrive40e have normal size petrol engines and that has turned out to be the most efficient way to go. Non-plug-in hybrids usually need a bigger engine because they are actually running on it for most of a long journey. What's more interesting to me is what kind of IC engine they put in. A diesel hybrid rather defeats the object. Toyota got it right originally with the Prius. And I was hugely impressed by the VW Passat GTE: honestjohn.co.uk/road-tests/volkswagen/volkswagen-passat-gte-2015-road-test// (Which helps to confirm I am not anti-VW. I merely reflect the complaints I receive.)\n\nDo you know (or know of) Charis Whitcombe? She writes in the CSMA \"Club Life\" magazine, in NewCarNet.co.uk and is associate editor of ClassicDriver.com/ On page 52 of the January/February 2016 edition she writes: \"we are left wondering who exactly knew about this VW NOx emissions scam and why it was not spotted before millions of consumers were swindled. And have other manufacturers fitted \"defeat devices\" to their cars, too? I will quote what some industry insiders told me 5 years ago, when we highlighted the existence of such chicanery in this very magazine. I had rung a mate. He revealed that some manufacturers are sneaky enough to programme the car's ECU to sense when it is being put through an NEDC. The car then defaults to a \"leaner\" fuelling programme. If I knew about \"defeat devices\" being used 5 years ago, how can the industry not have known?\" These are verbatim extracts.\n\nPD, Lyndhurst\n\nYes, I know Charis. There have been lots of unattributable whispers about this and other VAG nasties for years. VAG is continuing to obfuscate. Of course the senior executives knew because they gave the orders to meet the US EPA NOx limits without spending any significant money. If a lie is repeated often enough, people will start to believe it or otherwise just give up arguing. What tells you that Charis is writing the truth is the lack of any attempt at libel action against her. The latest excuse VAG has issued in the USA is that its people did not understand the rules, so did not realise they were breaking them. However, no VW owner has actually lost out over this. Their cars run exactly the same as they did before the scandal broke. VAG should be compensating owners for the unusually high clogging rate of EGRs on its EA189 engines, but people haven't been \"swindled\".", "We've already seen the exterior of the rear-wheel drive Opel GT concept, and now we're getting a look at the sports car's interior ahead of its debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show next month.\n\nThe interior is styled to mirror the exterior, with the same combination of dominant silver with red and black accents. The instrument panel is made from brushed aluminum as a visual reminder of the GT's lightweight construction, and is also a structural member, Opel says. Following in the footsteps of automakers like BMW and Tesla Motors [NSDQ:TSLA], Opel also ditched exterior mirrors. The GT features a pair of monitors at the extreme ends of the dashboard that show feed from cameras mounted behind the front wheel arches.\n\nALSO SEE: 2017 Maserati Levante Leaked\n\nThat's not the only thoroughly modern touch on this sports car concept. There are no buttons anywhere in the cabin; everything is controlled by voice or through the central touchpad. Opel claims the car can gradually learn a driver's preferences by analyzing things like commands and control inputs, and eventually predict what he or she wants.\n\nThe instrument cluster includes two round re-configurable displays that mimic traditional gauges. The left display always shows speed and engine rpm, while the right display can be changed to show other information like a navigation map, or even g-force readouts. Based on technology that debuted on the Opel Monza concept at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, both displays can be backlit in different colors depending on the driver's mood, and display certain things in 3D.\n\nThe GT can even channel a bit of KITT and issue warnings like \"Don't overlook the motorcycle behind us!\" It takes backseat driving to a whole new level.\n\nStay tuned for the debut on the March 1 opening day of the Geneva Motor Show.

It's the Week in Reverse, right here on Motor Authority.\n\nWe finally slid behind the wheel of the new 2016 BMW M2. The questions weighing on everyone's mind were: Does BMW still have its magic? And, can BMW still build an exciting car? After some hot laps at Laguna Seca and time on California back roads, we found our answer.\n\nMaserati just started to tease the upcoming 2017 Levante SUV before its introduction at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show, but photos of the production model have been leaked.

Dealing with her guilt has taken longer.\n\n\"It was a very long road to go from 'I am a bad mother' to 'I have made mistakes,\"' Dube told The Canadian Press during a recent interview in her rented Miami bungalow. \"There's a difference between the two.\"\n\nNow 53, Dube stepped down as consul general last August after Jean and another teenager died in a hail of gunfire in a dingy Miami-area apartment. Outside, his brother Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, was waiting in their mother's car.\n\nDube had thought little of it when Jean had asked for money to buy a textbook and take Marc to a restaurant and movie. The older teen had been doing well and she thought he could do with a reward. She loaned him her black BMW, with its diplomatic license plates, because his car, which she now drives, was in the shop.\n\nInstead, that March 30 afternoon, the brothers headed to the apartment to meet a pot dealer. Jean was carrying a loaded handgun. His plan, police would allege, was to rob the dealer of about 800 grams of marijuana.\n\n\"I didn't know Jean was capable of carrying a gun and entering an apartment and doing drug-trafficking, let alone to steal,\" said Dube, who remains a Canadian government employee on sick leave.\n\nJean left Marc sitting in the passenger seat when he went into the apartment, where the situation went horribly wrong. Within minutes, Jean and Joshua Wright, 17, would die in an exchange of gunfire.\n\nOutside, a distraught Marc was arrested. Investigators refused his repeated pleas to call his mom, who would go to bed that night wondering why she couldn't reach her kids by phone.\n\nIt became clearer early the next morning.\n\nAn anxious Dube was on her way to work when a friend at the Canadian embassy in Washington -- alerted by the U.S. State Department, who had been contacted by local authorities -- called to ask if her kids were OK, then directed her to a local hospital.\n\nHer unease turned to dread, then horror when the hospital advised her to call police and a detective told her by phone that Jean was dead and Marc was in custody.\n\nIn court, the judge gave the grief-stricken mother 30 seconds to hug her bereft, defeated son, who kept saying: \"Jean est mort. Jean est mort.\"\n\nAt that moment, she said, she knew she had to shape up -- for Marc's sake. \"I couldn't grieve for Jean at that point.

Dealing with her guilt has taken longer.\n\n\"It was a very long road to go from 'I am a bad mother' to 'I have made mistakes,'\" Dube told The Canadian Press during a recent interview in her rented Miami bungalow. \"There's a difference between the two.\"\n\nNow 53, Dube stepped down as consul general last August after Jean and another teenager died in a hail of gunfire in a dingy Miami-area apartment. Outside, his brother Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, was waiting in their mother's car.\n\nDube had thought little of it when Jean had asked for money to buy a textbook and take Marc to a restaurant and movie. The older teen had been doing well and she thought he could do with a reward. She loaned him her black BMW, with its diplomatic licence plates, because his car, which she now drives, was in the shop.\n\nInstead, that March 30 afternoon, the brothers headed to the apartment to meet a pot dealer. Jean was carrying a loaded handgun. His plan, police would allege, was to rob the dealer of about 800 grams of marijuana.\n\n\"I didn't know Jean was capable of carrying a gun and entering an apartment and doing drug-trafficking, let alone to steal,\" said Dube, who remains a Canadian government employee on sick leave.\n\nJean left Marc sitting in the passenger seat when he went into the apartment, where the situation went horribly wrong. Within minutes, Jean and Joshua Wright, 17, would die in an exchange of gunfire. Outside, a distraught Marc was arrested. Investigators refused his repeated pleas to call his mom, who would go to bed that night wondering why she couldn't reach her kids by phone.\n\nIt became clearer early the next morning.\n\nAn anxious Dube was on her way to work when a friend at the Canadian embassy in Washington - alerted by the U.S. State Department, who had been contacted by local authorities - called to ask if her kids were OK, then directed her to a local hospital. Her unease turned to dread, then horror when the hospital advised her to call police and a detective told her by phone that Jean was dead and Marc was in custody.\n\nIn court, the judge gave the grief-stricken mother 30 seconds to hug her bereft, defeated son, who kept saying: \"Jean est mort. Jean est mort.\"\n\nAt that moment, she said, she knew she had to shape up - for Marc's sake. \"I couldn't grieve for Jean at that point.

I'm sure Lexus knows this is transmission technology perfected in an '89 Corolla. But what makes the LC 500h interesting is the way Lexus applies the 4-speed.\n\nThe Multi Stage Hybrid system marries a 3.5-liter, 220-horsepower V6 engine, an electric motor, a lithium-ion battery pack and the 4-speed auto box to the customary continuously variable transmission (CVT).\n\nThe presence of what is essentially two transmissions is supposed to give drivers a closer correlation between throttle input and engine RPM.\n\nFurthermore, the Mutli Stage Hybrid System features an \"M\" mode manual gear shifting function -- making this the first time the driver of a Lexus hybrid has been able to change his own gears.\n\nLexusLexus Multi Stage Hybrid System.\n\nThink of this as an admission from Toyota that its highly efficient and effective hybrid drive system with a CVT is truly dreary to drive (although BI's Matt DeBord, a Prius owner who likes to kick his hybrid into \"Power Mode\" and sling it around corners might disagree).\n\nAccording to Lexus, the 500h's multi stage system generates a total of 354 horsepower, resulting in a 0-62 mph time of less than 5-seconds.\n\nThese figures fall in the same neighborhood as BMW's 357 horsepower i8 hybrid sports car. OK, so it's quite a lot faster than a Prius.\n\nIn addition to its innovative hybrid system, the LC 500h is the first car to be equipped with Lexus' new premium rear-wheel-drive platform that will serve as the basic underpinnings for all of the company's upcoming front-engine-rear-wheel-drive cars.\n\nLexus\n\nFor those with more conventional driving tastes, the standard LC 500 is available with the old school, 5.0-liter, 467-horsepower V8 engine found shared with the RC-F coupe and the GS-F sedan. Lexus claims the V8-powered LC will be able to hit 60 mph in under 4.5 seconds.\n\nThe LC 500h will make its official world debut at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show in March.\n\nLexus hasn't released pricing or fuel economy information for the LC 500h, which is expected to hit showrooms some time in 2017.", "The new 2016 BMW M2 is the much-awaited successor to the 1 Series M Coupe, which was last sold in 2012. It's a slightly smaller alternative to the M4 coupe, with a wheelbase 120 mm shorter, but it uses lots of chassis and engine parts from the M3 and M4.\n\nIt's intended as a more \"pure\" sports coupe than the M4, more focused on the track experience and on the lightweight driving dynamics than its bigger brothers, which is quite the claim. Its head of engineering calls it \"something like a motorcycle on four wheels.\"\n\nWalkaround\n\nThe M2 looks like a compact BMW coupe, with its twin-kidney grill and side \"swage\" line that adds a horizontal crease below the windows between the front and back wheels. Paintwork is exemplary, as it should be for a $61,000 car, though the only colour available at that price is Alpine White. If you want the tester's Long Beach Blue metallic, or Black Sapphire metallic or Mineral Grey metallic, that'll be an extra $850.\n\nThat's it for options, though, other than a standard or automatic transmission, and a Bluetooth choice for two phones. Literally everything else comes as standard.\n\nAccording to the press bump, \"the sculptural wing extensions at the front and rear axle ... immediately bring to mind the image of a muscular athlete with broad shoulders in a figure-hugging race suit, and visually enhance the car's standout dynamic abilities.\" I include that statement more for the entertainment value of its hyperbole than anything else. You can look at the pictures and make up your own mind.\n\nInterior\n\nThis is no CSL stripper, with a cardboard trunk and no air-conditioning or radio. It might be intended as a track missile, but the M2 is still comfortable and well-equipped. The seats adjust and extend at the knees, and the side bolsters can squeeze in for Canadians and out for Americans.\n\nThere's real carbon fiber on the door trims and the centre console and dash, as well as embossed \"M\" designs on the black leather and signature blue stitching. It's one of the more attractive of the otherwise Spartan BMW interiors, and all falls readily to hand.\n\nNone of this applies to the rear seats, though. Their leather is thick and accommodating, and leg room isn't too bad if the front passengers slide their seats forward a bit, but headroom is only good for kids who still have some growing to do. I'm just under six feet tall and I had to kink my head to one side to fit in the back. Fortunately - and BMW knows this very well - most 2 Series drivers could not care less about the back seats and the people who might one day need to sit in them.\n\nTechnology\n\nThere's full connectivity in the M2, as there should be with all cars these days, but the real tech is under the hood and between the wheels. The 3.0-litre inline-six engine now makes 365 horsepower, a 43-hp bump from the M235i Coupe. Its torque seems less dramatic, 343 lbs-ft compared to 332, but that bumps up to 369 lbs-ft on overboost.\n\nThe extra power is found by integrating the Twin Scroll Turbo into the manifold, and by borrowing performance parts from the M3 and M4, including the pistons and crankshaft main bearing shells. It has additional cooling too, to let it spend more time on the track without blowing up: an extra water cooler for the engine and a separate oil cooler for the transmission. As well, the oil sump's been modified and fitted with a suction pump to make sure everything stays properly lubricated as the engine gets flung around through the corners.\n\nThe M2 is 95 kg lighter than the smaller M235i, despite sharing the same engine size.\n\nIt's all about lightness for the M2. It's heavier than the M235i, but it's much beefier. It finds the savings through aluminum suspension and stiffening plates from the M3 and M4, as well as via aluminum wheels and lightweight steel used in the rear axle subframe.\n\nIn the end, all that really matters for an M2 owner is the driving experience. BMW engineers here called it \"chuckable\" for its agility and ability. I switched the Drive Mode to Sport Plus and threw it around the track for lap after lap and never once got into trouble.\n\nOf course, I'd have got into trouble with BMW if I'd pressed the \"M Dynamic\" button that allows a lot more oversteer before the differential's traction control kicks in. I watched a video that showed M2s sliding around the asphalt in clouds of impressive smoke, but then the track marshal imposed a blanket ban on drifting. They wanted to save the Michelin Super Sports, apparently, which were developed especially for the car.\n\nThe Drive Mode selector offers a choice of Comfort - which is still pretty stiff - or Sport or Sport Plus. Basically, everything tightens for the sportier drive, including the suspension, steering, gearing and brake and throttle response, and loosens for the time on the highway.\n\nThe differential is clever enough to monitor the steering angle, accelerator position, brake pressure, engine torque, wheel speed and yaw rate to know exactly what's going on with the rear driving wheels, and can adjust them within 150 milliseconds to keep everything under control. It will even anticipate slippage in some conditions, including around \"enthusiastically driven corners,\" to even out the allowed traction between the wheels.\n\nSteering is everything you could want, which is high praise for an electric steering system. It grows firmer with speed and adjusts with the drive mode setting, but feeds back lots of input to the driver without being tiring in any way. This is a considerable improvement over just five years ago.\n\nTransmissions\n\nOn the track, I drove an M2 equipped with the seven-speed automatic double-clutch transmission, which was simple and effective. Blip the paddles up or down and the car punches you in the seat of the pants with each accelerating upshift, then takes care of business going down. When launch control is activated, BMW claims a 4.3-second time for the zero-to-100 km/h run.\n\nIt's slightly slower with the six-speed manual transmission, clocking in at 4.5 seconds for the same sprint. I used a stickshift M2 to drive sedately down the Pacific Coast after my time on the track and enjoyed it immensely. It's not too short a shift and it snicks confidently through the double-H gate. It even matches the revs to smooth out the whole process, blipping the throttle on downshifts and lowering the revs on upshifts. You can turn this off if you want, when you're driving alone, but chances are you won't be any better at it.\n\nFuel\n\nFunnily enough, BMW made a big deal of talking about the M2's improved fuel consumption, but never once actually said what it is. North American figures have not yet been released. In its European literature, BMW claims a city consumption of 11.6 L/100 km and a highway consumption of 6.7, for a combined rating of 8.5 L/100 km. This is truly impressive, especially given the RWD M235i has an official Canadian combined consumption of 9.9 L/100 km. On my gentle drive down the coast, I saw an average consumption of 8.9 L/100 km -- premium gas, of course. That's good for an engine with such racing prowess.\n\nNot that most owners really care about fuel consumption, though it will ease their conscience at a cocktail party and it helps BMW reach overall fleet targets. \"Everyone expects for M to achieve a good fuel consumption, even though it's an M,\" says Frank Van Meel, BMW's president of the M Division, \"but I think for the typical M customer, more important is vehicle dynamics, precision, agility and track performance.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nAll of which begs the question: If that's what you want, what are your other choices?\n\nIn its size bracket, the only comparable premium performance compact coupe is the Mercedes-Benz CLA 45 AMG, which retails for $51,800. That seems a lot less expensive, but it quickly becomes a similar price once you start adding options that come as standard with the BMW. The two coupes come down to personal preference -- indeed, the M2's head of chassis development, the manager of the department where the magic happens, came to BMW two years ago from Mercedes-AMG.\n\nYou could wait another year for the Audi RS3 to come to Canada, but although it's been unofficially confirmed, there's no date yet for its arrival that's even been whispered. It could be a long wait.\n\nOr you could go down in size to the Volkswagen Golf R, but that's a whole different beast and BMW owners tend to sneer at VWs. Other than the Benz, the only real competition is the slightly larger M3 sedan and M4 coupe. So the decision's up to you: How much space do you really need? And how much purity do you really want?", "Yesterday, Audi announced a new all wheel drive system it says is more efficient than its traditional Quattro system. Quattro has been available on Audis in one form or another for 40 years. The Audi Quattro Ultra system is said to improve efficiency by 5% in normal driving and more in steady state highway driving. It works by adding clutch packs just after the transmission and before the rear differential that decouple the rear driveshaft from the rear differential.\n\nThe system needs about a quarter of a second to react and couple everything back together when the computer senses a need for all wheel drive such as wheel spin at the front of the car or a demand for full acceleration from the driver. It says upcoming autonomous features will give the system better predictive powers to ensure all wheel drive is available when needed.\n\nCar and Driver recently got to test drive a car equipped with Quattro Ultra in the mountains of Austria. It says it was impossible to detect when the system coupled and uncoupled while driving aggressively. The system was developed by automotive supplier Magna. It took five years to get everything to work the way Audi thought it should. It will be offered on all Audis with 4 cylinder engines and some with lower power V-6 units. It cannot currently handle the torque generated by the engines in Audi's performance models.\n\nWhile a 5% gain in efficiency is laudable, it begs the question: Isn't there a better way than with a mechanical system that is so costly and complex? The folks at GKN, another automotive supply house, think the answer is yes. It is showcasing its new electric eTwinster axle for automakers this week at its Wintertest proving ground in Arjeplog, located in Northern Sweden.\n\nThe eTwinster is a plug-in hybrid module that makes it simpler for vehicle platforms to offer electric all-wheel drive and torque vectoring. The driveline combines eAxle technologies proven in the Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine, Porsche 918 Spyder, and BMW i8 plug-in hybrids and the twin-clutch torque vectoring technology that features in the Ford Focus RS and Range Rover Evoque, according to a company press release.\n\nThe GKN system features a 60 kW electric motor with 177 lb-ft of torque through a 1:10 reduction gear. A system of clutches distributes the power to each wheel according to how much grip it has on the road surface, a process known as \"torque vectoring.\"GKN head of technology Peter Moelgg says, \"We believe our prototype torque-vectoring eAxle system represents the next step forward for the industry: a production-ready way to create higher performance hybrids that are more rewarding to drive.\"\n\nMoelgg adds, \"GKN is focused on developing technologies that can achieve this crucial tipping point for electric drives in mass production. More powerful, dynamic electric drives from GKN will help put batteries in the driving seat and create new electric driving experiences for customers. The success of our eAxle systems in cars for Porsche, BMW and Volvo demonstrated how the right kind of hybridization creates new value propositions for the driver. Torque vectoring is the next step and we are excited to be demonstrating this technology during Wintertest.\"\n\nBy 2025, GKN forecasts that 40-50% of vehicles will have some level of electrification, with a greater proportion hybrids' power delivered from the electric motor. The eTwinster could be programmed and integrated into a vehicle platform for production within the next three years.\n\nAll wheel drive used to be a rare and expensive option. Within a few years it may be as common as cell phones. Audi's Quattro Ultra may be nothing more than a stop gap measure on the highway to vehicle electrification.", "Quirky industry outsider Morgan is ready to cause a stir with its first-ever all-electric model\n\nMorgan has been defying the critics for years, and is about to shock the motoring world with its first electric car. For a firm accused of living in the past and using outdated production methods to build its classic sports cars, Morgan says its electric venture will prove it is very much at the cutting edge of technology.\n\nThe Government clearly believes in Morgan, because it has awarded the company a \u00a36million grant to develop its electric model and a range of heavily downsized fuel-efficient petrol engines with the latest electrification.\n\n* The best sports cars to buy right now\n\nChief executive Steve Morris says the Government grant was \"a big vote of confidence\" in Morgan, and added: \"This will help make us one of the greenest car companies in the world for CO2 emissions.\n\n\"We may make classic British sports cars using traditional hand-built methods, but we have our eyes wide open when it comes to cutting-edge technology and we are working with some of the biggest names in the industry.\"\n\nMorris reveals that Morgan's new EV3 all-electric version of its three-wheel model and its hybridisation plans will help it double sales from 800 cars last year to 1,600 within five years. The firm will also look to double its workforce in the same period from 180 to 360, and create hundreds more jobs with its suppliers.\n\nThe EV3 three-wheeler will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show at the start of March, and Morris says production will start in the last quarter of this year, with first sales in early 2017 and an expected price of around \u00a330,000.\n\nThe electric Morgan will be powered by an 18kWh battery to give it a range of 120 miles, and the model will be the firm's first to use carbon fibre parts. Morris says a key factor in developing the electric version was to retain the \"emotion and drama\" of a sports car that is crucial to Morgan's DNA. He stressed: \"I love the roar of a V8 engine in our sports cars, and when I first drove the electric three-wheeler, the silence was very different. But it still has a wow factor... just a very different wow factor.\"\n\nMorris is reluctant to go into detail about the firm's hybridisation plans, but says it will start with a three-cylinder engine and also retain a new version of its 3.0-litre straight-six twin turbo supplied by BMW. He insists any downsizing of engines will always result in an improvement in performance and fuel economy, plus lower CO2 emissions.\n\nWalking around the ageing Morgan factory tucked away in the Worcestershire hills is like taking a trip down memory lane, with the company still using traditional wooden frame bodies and workers beating body panels with a hammer. There is a charm and organised chaos about the building, alongside a highly skilled workforce you won't find in the rest of today's hi-tech automated car industry. It's fair to say that Morgan is a slightly eccentric one-off.\n\nMorris is quick to stress that the workforce is pivotal to the success of Morgan: \"Everything revolves around our highly skilled workforce. We rely on our people and we are investing heavily in training and creating new apprentices.\"\n\nOne of those apprentices who are the long-term future of Morgan is 21-year-old Luke Smith, now in his fourth year as an apprentice sheet metal worker. Luke's training is very much hands-on, as he explained: \"I am learning all the skills needed from the old boys in the factory who have years of experience and knowledge.\n\n\"I love working for Morgan because we are hand-building traditional sports cars, and it's a small British car firm that is famous all over the world.\"\n\nAnd Morgan's youth policy extends across the business. Chief designer Jon Wells is a youthful 29-year-old, with the heavy burden of designing the Morgans of the future. \"We make traditional classic sports cars that are unashamedly nostalgic, and I think we can continue to evolve the design.\"\n\nCritics say there should be no place in the modern motoring world for a firm like Morgan, whose models look like they belong in a bygone age. But Morgan has been successfully defying the odds for most of its history. Such is the lure and magic of the brand that over 30,000 owners and friends took an official tour around the factory in Malvern last year.\n\nMorris concedes that finding the right balance between making traditional sports cars that embrace the latest tech is challenging, but believes it is what makes Morgan different from much of the sterile, run of-the-mill modern car industry.\n\nMorris, who has worked his way from the shop floor to the top job in a 32-year career at Morgan, says his long-term goal is to make it a robust company that achieves sustainable growth, and not be a 'boom or bust' business. But he accepts that being such a small player presents ongoing challenges: \"The real challenge in developing new models is always cash. We are a small independent company and we have to get the most out of our limited budget.\n\n\"But we remain in control of our own destiny and we represent a small business with great British workers who have real skills and produce cars with a difference that people all over the world want to buy.\"\n\nMorgan is becoming more efficient, too, as it has reduced the waiting list for a car from five years in the nineties down to nine months now. And, as we left the factory, a car transporter arrived to collect Morgans to be shipped around the world, including a vivid green Plus 4 model on its way to a waiting owner in New Zealand.\n\nMorgan may be small in size but its appeal stretches across the world - and it is every inch a very British affair.", "MUMBAI: Maruti Vitara Brezza emerged as a showstopper not just at the recently concluded Auto Expo, but also in the digital world, drawing the highest buzz on social media, while German luxury car manufacturer, BMW generated the maximum excitement online. Other models like the Hyundai Tucson and Honda BRV also generated a fair amount of online buzz, says an analysis done for the period February 3 to 9, by Nielsen, shared with TOI exclusively.\n\nThe 'Social Media Buzz Analysis' for the Auto Expo indicates a trend where such shows have also become social events, through which consumers are sharing and engaging with the automobile sector. In fact, the analysis could pose learnings for companies on how to engage socially with consumers, and how to get more bang from the buck, in the digital space.\n\nThe analysis studied the buzz generated on digital media in the form of content submitted to a social networking site -- a blog post, Facebook status update, a tweet, video upload to YouTube or photo upload to Flickr, etc. It took into account the buzz which was consumer generated and spontaneous, as well as that through company-driven media activities that led to consumer interaction on content.

This trend, as India continues to get digital, cannot be ignored. Our studies and analyses clearly shows that owned media activity triggers earned media i.e. word of mouth. Since media-led publicity is far more influential, it makes sense for brands to take that route since this would have greater resonance among the general audience\".\n\nWhile individual posts made are still the highest on Twitter, the larger number of interactions on Facebook, made latter more popular for marketers, the analysis adds.", "HONG KONG -- New car sales in China rose by more than 9 percent last month as strong demand for SUVs offset a decline in sales of sedans, an industry group reported Friday.\n\nSales of cars, SUVs and minivans in the world's biggest auto market totaled 2.23 million vehicles in January, up 9.3 percent from a year earlier, according to figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nTotal vehicle sales last month, including buses and trucks, rose 7.1 percent to 2.45 million.\n\nChinese auto sales were hit by an unexpectedly sharp contraction in the summer but government tax cuts on small-engine vehicles have helped sales rebound since then. The strongest demand is for cheap sport utility vehicles by Chinese brands, which is helping them claw market share away from long-dominant foreign brands such as Volkswagen and General Motors.\n\nSales of sport utility vehicles jumped 60.5 percent to 784,900 while the number of basic passenger cars sold dropped 9 percent to 1.1 million, the association said.\n\nChinese-brand auto sales rose 16.6 percent from the year before to just over 1 million.\n\nThe data is likely to be distorted by the Lunar New Year, with car buyers moving up their purchases before dealerships shut for the weeklong holiday, which this year fell in February.\n\n\"Normally it is always good in the beginning of the year\" for auto sales, said Zhang Xin of Guotai Jun'an Securities in Beijing. \"People get their annual bonus and the long vacation encourages their purchases,\" he said.\n\nZhang said he would wait for more data before making a judgment on the longer-term trend in sales.\n\nAmong individual brands, Ford Motor Co. sales rose 36 percent last month to 130,832 vehicles thanks to strong demand for its SUVs lineup as well as Mondeo and Escort models.

Dean Kirby leases a vehicle, pays for auto insurance and gasoline, and buys Braves season tickets with money from his campaign account.\n\nHe spends thousands a year on a campaign credit card, despite having no opponents for re-election for most of his 25 years in office. He says much of this spending is to cover expenses from serving as a lawmaker.\n\nBut he also receives thousands of dollars a year from taxpayers for expenses. He received $19,440 last year to cover travel, food and other costs beyond the $23,575 considered salary for the part-time legislative job. Kirby lives in Pearl, just a short distance from the Capitol in Jackson.\n\nA Clarion-Ledger investigation shows that for many Mississippi politicians, campaign funds have become personal expense accounts or a second income -- potentially tax free. The spending is largely paid for by lobbyists and special interests doing business with state government. They otherwise would not be allowed to lavish cash, gifts or a second income on politicians.\n\nCampaign funds are shielded from taxes, ethics and other laws because they are ostensibly to be used only for campaigning and records of them are -- ostensibly -- open to the public.\n\nMost states and the federal government, in efforts to reduce the corrosive influence of money in politics, have stringent reporting requirements. Mississippi doesn't.\n\nMost states also have prohibitions against personal spending of campaign money.\n\nIn Mississippi, the practice is common.\n\nState Rep. Mark Formby has bought suits and an $800 pair of cowboy boots with campaign funds. He says they're a legislative expense -- he doesn't wear them at home in Picayune. He also pays for an apartment in Jackson year-round and legislative travel from his campaign account. He appears to spend very little on anything remotely related to campaigning from his campaign funds.\n\nBut taxpayers also pay Formby for expenses, including $26,598 last year for travel, lodging and other costs. Coupled with his legislative salary, his total from the state for the part-time job is $50,172, according to a state auditor's report.\n\nFormby's campaign account is filled almost exclusively with donations from lobbyists, big business representatives and PACs. At last report he had more than $100,600 on hand.\n\nFormby questioned whether he is being singled out because he reports expenditures such as clothing, boots and rent. He said others don't properly detail spending. He appears to be correct about the absence of detailed reporting.\n\nPoliticians are supposed to detail the money moving into and out of their campaign funds in regular reports available to the public. But many reports don't add up.\n\nHouse Speaker Philip Gunn loaned himself $25,000 from his campaign his first year in office, with public records showing he paid back only $11,000. Even though he didn't report it, he says he paid the rest back over time, personally eating many small campaign expenses until the balance was nil. But he also spends tens of thousands of dollars a year on a campaign credit card with no explanation of what he bought.\n\nCampaign expenditures of $200 or more are supposed to be itemized. But many politicians just list lump-sum payments to a credit card or themselves with no detail of the spending.\n\nAttorney General Jim Hood has paid himself and two credit cards a total of $268,180 from his campaign account over nearly four years, with no details of the spending.\n\nMany campaign finance reports are incomplete, incorrect, illegible or missing from the secretary of state's public website.\n\nState Rep. Deborah Butler Dixon's campaign reports indicate she spent $7,200 on gasoline over just a few months last year, including $1,200 in June.\n\nOtherwise, her reports don't show much at all. Dixon filed a blank form covering 2012, and her report covering 2014 is missing from the website. Explanations for one of her disbursements of $1,000 lists \"Auto GAS-Travel\" as the payee, \"CASH\" for the address and \"Auto GAS (CASH)\" as the purpose. A $5,000 expense is listed as \"Casual Labors,\" with no other info.\n\nDixon said she spent so much on gasoline because she lives in Hinds County so she doesn't get legislative mileage reimbursement from taxpayers. She said she had a blank report because she spent her own money that year. She would not answer other questions.\n\nEnforcement of state campaign finance laws is nearly nonexistent, and past reform measures have been snuffed out quickly in the Legislature. The issue came to the fore recently, when The Clarion-Ledger reported that multiple sources, including one of his former campaign staffers, confirmed the FBI is investigating State Auditor Stacey Pickering's campaign-finance records.\n\nPickering has paid himself, his wife and credit cards more than $170,000 from his campaign account over nearly four years, most listed as travel reimbursement during off-years for election.\n\nPickering bought a BMW 325i, listed on his campaign finance report as a \"fundraising fee expense,\" that he gave to his daughter. Pickering also purchased an RV that he initially said was to save on hotels while campaigning. His wife, in a column she writes for the Disney Parks Moms website, said that after her family got an RV, \"We now consider Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort & campground our second home.\"\n\n'Recipe for ethical disaster'\n\nMississippi law lacks a clear prohibition on politicians using campaign donations for personal expenses.\n\nCombine this with weak campaign finance reporting regulations, weak ethics laws and almost nonexistent enforcement, and Mississippi has what some experts and politicians say is an invitation to corruption.\n\n\"It seems like you have a recipe for an ethical disaster -- bad reporting with the ability to turn it into personal use,\" said Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, D.C. \"And if the laws you do have aren't being enforced, that could lead people down very bad roads.\n\n\"When you have virtual nonreporting, very lax or nonexistent laws about personal use and add to it that some candidates are virtually living off the money, that's really adding pressure on candidates to listen to the lobbyist donors because it's not just for a campaign, but the ability to live. Also, it becomes hard to tell the difference between a campaign contribution and a bribe. If a candidate wants to live well, and everybody knows his campaign is used for living expenses, a lobbyist could take advantage of that.\"\n\nThe Rev. J. Curtis Pace, after his first, unsuccessful foray into state politics running for a Neshoba County state Senate seat last year, has a more definitive take on Mississippi's campaign finance setup.\n\n\"It's legalized bribery,\" Pace said.\n\n\"You hear about the power and influence of money in politics, but you don't really see it as concrete until you start to look into it directly,\" Pace said.\n\nFormer Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had a similar takeaway from his unsuccessful run for attorney general against Hood.\n\n\"What really put it on my radar was I heard our attorney general was handing out contracts to various attorneys in state and out of state,\" Hurst said. \" I looked at campaign finance reports, and there were all these recipients of contracts making donations. Then, there's $7,000 or $8,000 a month in totally nonitemized (campaign account) spending in nonelection years.\"\n\nHurst, who as a federal prosecutor handled some of Mississippi's biggest public corruption cases, said, \"It made me immediately think about money laundering.\"\n\n\"It really raised suspicion in my mind,\" Hurst said. \"We're talking about three nonelection years before a campaign, and it added up to almost a quarter of a million dollars over three years, completely nonitemized.\"\n\nHurst made this a campaign issue. He also made his campaign credit card statements and his personal income tax forms public online, challenging Hood to do the same. Hood did not.\n\nHurst said he tried during his race to file credit card documents itemizing his campaign spending with the secretary of state's office, but \"they refused,\" saying they weren't required and wouldn't be posted.\n\nHood has refused to answer specific questions about his campaign spending.\n\nTaxes and 'double dipping'\n\nThe widespread contention among Mississippi politicians that using campaign funds for personal expenses is \"legal\" is based on the absence of a clear prohibition and on a 1978 attorney general's opinion.\n\nBut that opinion includes warnings about legal, ethical and tax implications of such practice.\n\nThe opinion says, \"Simply put, a campaign contribution is not a gift to be used as a person may please.\"\n\nThe opinion notes that conversion of campaign funds for personal use \"could be considered income and subject to income tax.\"\n\nState Department of Revenue spokeswoman Kathy Waterbury said politicians using campaign funds on expenses for which the state reimburses them could pose a problem with \"double dipping.\"\n\n\"If you are being reimbursed by the state for your costs and also pulling it out of your campaign, one or the other would be taxable income,\" Waterbury said.\n\nIt's unclear whether Mississippi politicians are generally paying taxes on any spending from campaign accounts. Some say they don't because they don't consider any of their spending personal. Others say they do, while others say both. None of numerous elected officials asked have supplied credit card or tax documentation to date.\n\nKirby said, \"Anything I've even doubted, I pay taxes on.\" His CPA sent a statement to The Clarion-Ledger that said, \"Dean Kirby included personal use of the auto leased through his campaign as taxable income on his income tax return.\"\n\nHood declined an interview did not answer numerous emailed questions about his campaign finances. Instead his campaign manager, Jonathan Compretta, sent a statement that said, \"Campaign finance laws are clear as to the reporting requirements for candidates seeking public office. General Hood has met those requirements. He has paid all state and federal taxes that are owed as prepared by a certified public accountant.\"\n\nPickering has said, at turns, that he hasn't used campaign funds for personal expenses and that he has paid taxes on any personal spending.\n\nHe has said he paid \"tag, taxes and title\" for the BMW and RV. For a $3,000 garage door for his Laurel home, Pickering said, \"I filed it on my personal taxes, following the law.\"\n\nIn a recent interview at The Clarion-Ledger, Pickering said, \"No,\" when asked if he has used campaign money for personal expenses, but when asked about the RV and Disney said, \"When we have we've reimbursed. There has never been an outright expenditure. We've paid taxes on it or reimbursed ourselves. I have paid the taxes on those issues we thought would be.\"\n\nHe said, \"We have complied with state law, federal law every step of the way. Our statements have been very clear and concise.\"\n\nWaterbury said DOR has recently received numerous questions about campaign finances and taxes. She said that in lieu of clear state laws on what constitutes personal or taxable spending, she tells people the state would follow federal law and sends them a copy of pertinent code.\n\nFederal law says in general, \"Using campaign funds for personal use is prohibited\" but does allow some spending for \"individual's duties as a holder of federal office.\"\n\nBut federal law also considers as personal \"a home mortgage, rent or utility payment,\" clothing purchases, noncampaign-related auto expenses or noncampaign-related trips or vacations.\n\nAnd, Waterbury reiterated, \"You're not supposed to be making money on reimbursements, or else it's taxable.\"\n\nCalls for reform\n\nFor several years, Rep. Hank Zuber, R-Ocean Springs, has been a lone voice calling for campaign finance reform. He's filed bills to prohibit personal use of campaign money and to prohibit politicians \"cashing in\" their campaign accounts when they leave public office.\n\n\"Public servants shouldn't have a golden parachute when they leave office,\" Zuber said.\n\nZuber said he first proposed such legislation years ago after a constituent at a town hall meeting gave him an earful about politicians using campaign money for personal expenses.\n\n\"I didn't know it was allowed,\" Zuber said. \"I checked on it and found out you could do it.\"\n\nZuber said he hasn't recently pushed for an outright ban on personal use and has lowered his expectations -- he's only pushing for the ban on cashing in when leaving office. He said a total ban \"gets into a lot of gray area\" when politicians use their campaign money for political activity not directly related to campaigning.\n\nHood and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann are pushing for reform this legislative session. Both are pushing measures to require itemization of campaign credit card expenditures.\n\nHood further wants a prohibition on personal spending from campaign accounts.\n\nBoth Gov. Phil Bryant and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves said they would not oppose such reform.\n\nReeves said, \"If you look at my campaign finance reports, what you will find, I would argue, is that we provide more information than anybody else in state government. For the expenditures we make, we outline what those expenses are for We only spend money on campaign related expenses. I think that's what my donors expect of me, and we spend a significant amount of resources ensuring that.\"\n\nBoth Reeves and Bryant's campaign reports do generally provide more detail, and their travel expenses while running large statewide campaigns are in some cases lower than those of politicians far down-ticket.\n\nBut Reeves' campaign over nearly four years did have more than $80,000 in nonitemized credit card spending. Bryant's for the same period had about $8,400.\n\nReeves said, \"My general thoughts on campaign finance are -- and I've said this for years -- I'm for unlimited contributions and for unlimited disclosure. I don't think we ought to limit corporate contributions or limit what is disclosed to the public. I'm fine with showing every contribution that's made and every expenditure.\"\n\nHood also declined an interview or to specifically answer questions about state campaign finance laws and regulations or about what prompted his call for reform.\n\nBut in a written statement Hood said, \"As previously stated, current Mississippi law does not prohibit the use of campaign funds for non-campaign related expenditures. The law is clear as to the reporting requirements that must be followed.\n\n\"That said, voters want and deserve more transparency in this process and a new standard that every candidate must follow to alleviate the unnecessary speculation and innuendo that arises every four years,\" Hood said. \"That's why the Office of Attorney General is asking the Legislature to reform the law as it pertains to the reporting of campaign finances.\"\n\nNoble said reporting transparency should be the bedrock of any state campaign finance reform, to earn the public's trust.\n\n\"To me one of the biggest problems with a system like this would be lack of public confidence in the Legislature and government,\" Noble said. \"Even if people are voting their conscience and not influenced by money, a system like this would leave too much room for doubt.\n\n\"Campaign contributions are supposed to subsidize your campaign, not your lifestyle.\"", "If you're anything like me, when you're buying a car, you have to have the version with the most performance potential. For example, when my dad bought what I now refer to as his midlife crisis car, a 2003 Infiniti FX35, back when I was in eighth grade, I remember being disappointed that he left the dealer with the V-6 version instead of the burly 320-hp, V-8-powered FX45. I imagine this existential crisis plagues many a Corvette Stingray buyer; after all, if the 460-hp Corvette Stingray Z51 is great, wouldn't the 650-hp Corvette Z06 be even better? Having been daily-driving our long-term 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z51 for almost a year now, I spent a week doing my thing in a Corvette Z06 to find out.\n\nOver the past year, the MT long-term Corvette Stingray Z51 has seen its fair share of traffic, commuting, and open road. For a low-slung two-door sports car, there are worse things to commute in than our long-term Corvette. Although not necessarily ideal for my city-heavy slog through Los Angeles traffic, the 'Vette has a great ride for a sports car, good clutch feel, and great brakes. I find throttle response in the default Touring drive mode to be pretty slushy, so I instead drive everywhere in Sport mode. Hey, it's a Corvette. The manual transmission is mostly up to the task, too. Once the gearbox is warmed up, shifts are light and slick. While it's still cold, though, the gearbox has a tendency to fight being put into first gear or pop out of second gear; it's annoying, but my old Mustang did the same thing.\n\n2/18 11/18\n\nWith the keys to a bright yellow Corvette Z06 in hand, I sought to replicate how I'd been driving our long-term car as faithfully as possible. At first prod of the start button, things in my Z06 tester felt the same as the Z51, save for the extra loud staccato from the LT4 V-8. After a couple dozen miles or so, the differences start to reveal themselves. For starters, although the LT4 is great at making power, it's not so great at putting it down. In the regular Stingray, you can pretty easily use all 460 hp on tap without overwhelming the rear tires. The massive powerband of the supercharged Corvette Z06 is less accessible in every day driving -- gotta get ahead of the bus about to pull out in front of you? Need to avoid the Prius meandering aimlessly between lanes? Better be mighty careful with that throttle pedal because it's quite easy to get the rear end to step out, even with traction control on.\n\nTruthfully, the mode I chose could partially be to blame. As is the case in my long-term Corvette Z51, I spent most of my time in Sport mode in the Z06 because I wasn't happy with the non-linear throttle response in the street-oriented Touring mode. In addition to changing the throttle and traction control parameters, Sport mode also firms up the Corvette Z06's Magnetic Ride Control suspension system. The ride isn't at all objectionable on L.A.'s poorly maintained streets, but I preferred the ride in Tour mode and in our Corvette Z51 long-termer without MRC. It's too bad Chevy doesn't give you an additional customizable drive mode where you can adjust throttle response, steering feedback, suspension settings, and exhaust to your liking like BMW does with M mode on cars such as the M3.\n\nUltimately, as good as the Corvette Z06 is, I think I've found the rare exception where I'd rather have the \"slow\" version of a car rather than the high-power version. For me, driving a car where all the horsepower on tap is easily accessible far outweighs having performance potential that I'll never use.\n\nMore on our long-term 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Z51:\n\nArrival Update 1: Daily-Driver Performance Update 2: Practically Speaking Update 3: New Perspectives on our Long-Term 'Vette Update 4: A Week at the Dealer", "In a somewhat rare interview, Fortune's Adam Lashinsky sat down with Apple CEO Tim Cook for a wide-ranging discussion that touched on a number of topics, from Apple's floundering stock price, the proliferation of Apple Pay and the notion that we've reached 'peak' iPhone. But without question, the most interesting portion of the interview centered on Apple's somewhat mythical Apple Car.\n\nAs has become plainly evident over the past few months, Apple seems incredibly and genuinely interested in developing an electric car. Over the past few months, Apple has hired a number of auto executives and engineers with vast technical and business experience across all areas of the car development and manufacturing process. Notably, many of these hires have come from companies such as BMW, Tesla and other luxury automakers. Not only that, but we've also seen reports that Apple has a secret automotive testing facility up and running in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nTypically, when there's a lot of smoke there's fire. But Tim Cook, as is to be expected, did his best to say a lot without saying anything at all when pressed for more information about Apple's car plans.\n\nWhen asked flat-out why Apple doesn't just admit that they're researching an electric car, Cook coyly answered:\n\nYeah, I'm probably not going to do that. The great thing about being here is we're curious people. We explore technologies, and we explore products. And we're always thinking about ways that Apple can make great products that people love, that help them in some way. And we don't go into very many categories, as you know. We edit very much. We talk about a lot of things and do fewer. We debate many things and do a lot fewer.\n\nLashinsky, to his credit, didn't simply digest Cook's non-answer and move on. Instead he asked if Apple would really spend huge sums of money on a project (developing a car isn't cheap, after all) if it wasn't actually planning on commercializing it. In his next answer, Tim Cook was a tad more forthcoming.\n\nWell, could we? Yes. But would we? We don't have to spend large amounts to explore. So I can't talk about this certain area that you're talking about. But when we start spending large amounts of money, we're committed at that point. But we explore things with teams of people. And that's a part of being curious. Part of exploring technologies and picking the right one is becoming so familiar with it you can see ways that it can be used. And for us, we've never been about being first. We've been about being best. So we explore many different things, many different technologies. And at first we might not know what product it might wind up in. And then later we'll see that that really cool technology enables maybe things that we're doing today to take on something bigger, maybe something new. But once we start spending gobs of money -- like when we start spending on tooling and things like that -- we're committed.\n\nWhat's more, Cook also explained that he can envision a day where manufacturers make \"an automobile on a contract basis for someone else.\"\n\nHit the source link below for Cook's full interview. It's not necessarily mind blowing, but given how infrequently Apple executives tend to grant public interviews (relative to other tech companies), it's always worth seeing what they have to say when they do decide to speak up.", "This month belongs to the new BMW M2. The highly-awaited sports coupe made its world entrance last month at the Detroit Auto Show, followed just ...\n\nThis month belongs to the new BMW M2. The highly-awaited sports coupe made its world entrance last month at the Detroit Auto Show, followed just a few weeks later by the first press drives hosted at the Laguna Seca race track in Monterey. Last week we were on site to sample the M2 and first impressions have been nothing short of spectacular. There is likely no other car in BMW's current portfolio that gets so much love and words, and based on the response of the BMW community, the M2 will build a cult in the upcoming years.\n\nThough the M2 isn't the hardcore as its BMW 1 Series M predecessor was, the M2 feels overall as a more refined sportscar. It grips better, is faster and is more controllable than the 1M which will cater to a wide range of customers. Many readers have already reached out with questions regarding the M2 versus the M4, and which one makes more sense to purchase. And the answer is far from a simple one.\n\nBut what we can say is that the M2 is not a replacement for the M4 nor a poor man's M car. The M2 was born to fill a gap in the M lineup and to offer customers a great, sporty compact car. The decision won't be whether you can afford the M2 or the M4, the decision will be based on what type of driver you are and the type of fun you'd like to have. The M4 has that more raw power, while the M2 has the best balance between proportions and power. On a technical track, the M2 will be the fun car to drive, while on a faster track, the M4 will take you closer to the top speed.\n\nWhen it comes to the M235i and M2, the decision is solely based on your budget. If you have the money, the M2 is a no-brainer. But if those deep pockets are not so deep this year, then the M235i Coupe is certainly an entertaining compact coupe with very few competitors on the market.\n\nDesign wise, the M2 is a monster. While the car doesn't photograph too well - even though the photo gallery embedded here might contradict that statement - when seen from up-close, the M2 has fantastic proportions and a muscular appearance that only the 1M can match.

And aside from the tech hurdles currently being ironed out, there's still plenty of legislative details to sort through as well.\n\nAP Photo/Tony AvelarThis May 13, 2015 file photo shows the front of Google's new self-driving prototype car during a demonstration at the Google campus in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nIn any case, you can call the proliferation of connected cars a precursor to the self-driving revolution. Everything is at play. The internet-of-things, remote software updates and the tethering of home automation services in the car.\n\nMajor automakers have apparently realized that smartphone makers were beating them in the innovation game. While innovation in the mobile space burns hot and fast, the automakers, by comparison, were intent on developing their own technologies, partially out of fear of letting Silicon Valley in.\n\nBut that's changing now.\n\nAT&T, for example, now has relationships with 10 automakers, including Porsche, Audi, Tesla, Jaguar Land Rover, and Volvo -- all of which will implement AT&T's technology in their vehicles.\n\n\"As of last year, over fifty percent of new vehicles rolling off assembly lines were equipped with AT&T connectivity,\" Chris Penrose, who heads up connected cars at AT&T, said.", "Sick nine-year-old would bite and scratch but she cared for him without complaining: Son\n\nFor the past three years, Madam Tan Powi Kim, 62, cared tirelessly for her nine-year-old grandson, who suffers from a rare autoimmune condition .\n\nLooking after him was not an easy task, as he would bite, scratch and hit others involuntarily, said the boy's father - Madam Tan's son, - Mr Goh Cherk Wui, 35.\n\n\"But no matter what happened, she never complained,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Madam Tan's family - she also has two daughters - lost their pillar of strength when a black BMW car crashed into her and her husband in Collyer Quay.\n\nShe was taken to hospital where she died soon after.\n\nIt is understood that a 45-year-old man was arrested for causing death by a negligent act. He was not found to have a blood alcohol level above the legal driving limit.\n\nThe couple were loading cardboard boxes onto their lorry parked at a loading bay near the OUE Link Bridge when the accident happened just before 7am.\n\nShe had stood at the rear of the lorry to hand the boxes to her husband, Mr Cheng Kiat Yan, 68, who had climbed into the back.\n\nIt was a weekend routine the couple shared for the past 10 years, as Mr Cheng - her second husband - works as a rag-and-bone man.\n\nThe impact threw Mr Cheng off the lorry onto the ground and left him with a fractured knee.\n\nHe went home with his left leg in a cast, but yesterday was warded at Changi General Hospital after suffering from high fever, swollen arms and severe pain in his body through the night.\n\nSpeaking at the wake yesterday morning, Mr Goh broke down as he recalled his stepfather's phone call on Saturday morning.\n\n\"I remember clearly that I had just woken up. My phone rang and my stepfather was crying when he said, 'Mummy got hit, die already.'\n\n\"I knelt down and burst into tears. I couldn't accept it,\" said Mr Goh, who works in the shipping industry.\n\nHe went to the scene and learnt that she was already on the way to the hospital.\n\n\"I was very happy then. I thought that it meant there was a chance (of surviving),\" he said.\n\nNow, he wants to know how the accident happened.\n\n\"She was a victim of someone's actions.

Dubbed i3s, the electric vehicle is not only rumored to deliver a higher driving range, but also offer a sportier ride. The whole sporty angle of the i3 was also planned for the i3 Shadow Sport Edition, but the sport-tuned suspension was eventually nixed from U.S.-bound i3s. Not many other details are known at the moment, including the launch date, but the i3 could deliver additional power compared to the current i3. The i3's electric drivetrain generates output of 125 kW/170 hp and peak torque of 250 Newton meters, which is immediately available from a standing start.\n\nIn July 2016, BMW will also refresh its i3 electric car with a higher energy density battery. The current model consists of 8 x 2.7 kWh packs cells - each containing 12 x 3.75 volt, 60 Ah actual cells - wired in series for a nominal capacity of 21.8 kWh, 360 volts, of which 18.8 kWh are usable. The new battery is expected to have a 94Ah battery and the higher energy density will give the i3 an expected range of 120 miles. The actual rating will be issued by EPA after testing. EPA currently rates the i3 BEV at 81 miles.\n\nBMW hinted at the possibility of current owners to retrofit the battery, but the cost and process won't be revealed until we get close to the market launch.\n\nIt also remains to be seen if BMW will bundle the battery upgrade with the sports upgrades of the i3 and sell it as a single package.", "U.S. auto safety regulators are examining whether an additional 70 million to 90 million Takata Corp airbag inflators should be recalled because they may endanger drivers, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThat would nearly quadruple the 29 million inflators recalled so far and linked to nine deaths in the United States.\n\nIn all, as many as 120 million Takata inflators in U.S. vehicles contain the same volatile chemical - ammonium nitrate - used in inflators that automakers have recalled, according to company documents reviewed by Reuters and verified by two former Takata managers. The total number has not been previously reported.\n\nThe Japanese supplier, one of the world's largest airbag manufacturers, has said some inflators can rupture and explode with excessive force, spraying metal shards at vehicle occupants.\n\nThe number of vehicles affected remains unclear because many have more than one inflator, and not always from the same manufacturer. Before recent recalls of 5.4 million inflators, federal regulators said about 24 million defective Takata inflators were used in about 19 million vehicles that have been recalled since 2004.\n\nFor a graphic on how inflators work, see http://tmsnrt.rs/1JDZ4vq\n\nThe former managers described \"chronic\" quality failures at Takata's North American inflator plants, an assessment reflected in dozens of company emails and documents dating back to 2001. Those problems, the former managers said, make it difficult for the company and regulators to pinpoint which inflators - among tens of millions - pose a danger.\n\n\"You have no way of knowing,\" said one of the former Takata managers, who has direct knowledge of the company's history of manufacturing problems.\n\nThe former Takata managers, who still work in the industry, spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTakata declined to comment when asked about the possibility of massive additional recalls and whether another 70 million to 90 million inflators still in vehicles could endanger drivers. A torrent of new recalls could cost the company billions of dollars and add years to the replacement process.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it is \"cooperating fully with regulators and our automotive customers and continues to take aggressive action to advance vehicle safety.\"\n\nTakata cited its agreement with regulators in November to pay a $70 million penalty to NHTSA in a settlement that included its commitment to stop making inflators that use ammonium nitrate by 2018. It also pledged to declare all remaining ammonium nitrate inflators defective by 2019 unless it can demonstrate they are safe.\n\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration continues to investigate all Takata inflators using ammonium nitrate, but it has not yet found sufficient evidence to direct automakers to recall the remaining inflators, said spokesman Gordon Trowbridge.\n\n\"This issue will take years to resolve,\" Trowbridge said.\n\nTakata produced between 260 million and 285 million ammonium nitrate-based inflators worldwide between 2000 and 2015, of which nearly half wound up in U.S. vehicles, one of the former Takata managers told Reuters, citing the company's production records.\n\nTakata supplied those inflators to more than a dozen automakers, according to company documents reviewed by Reuters. Its single largest client was Honda Motor Co, which still owns a minority stake in Takata and has recalled more than 8 million defective Takata inflators in the U.S.\n\nTakata produced most of the inflators that regulators are now investigating at its main inflator plant in Monclova, Mexico or at plants in Georgia and Washington state, according to company documents. The documents noted persistent quality failures at those plants, which a former Takata official said contributed to inflator ruptures.\n\nLast month, Takata told NHTSA in a filing that \"manufacturing variability\" may have contributed to the ruptures.\n\nThe manufacturing problems are detailed in dozens of internal Takata emails, spreadsheets and presentations reviewed by Reuters. The records show the problems are more pervasive and continued for a longer period than those previously reported. They extended beyond the Mexican plant to the factories in Georgia and Washington state, and they continued until at least 2014, company records show.\n\nAmong the issues: metal shavings inside some inflator parts; improperly welded inflator casings; bad propellant wafers, and bent or damaged parts.\n\nThose problems eventually could allow moisture to contaminate the ammonium nitrate propellant, which in turn could lead to an inflator rupture, one of the former Takata managers told Reuters.\n\nA 2006 internal log of quality issues noted problems with inflators sold to Mazda Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, and Toyota Motor Corp. The log listed problems including metal shavings and contamination, broken or missing clips, and deformed or misaligned parts.\n\nIn a 2010 memo, a Takata manager expressed concern about \"how to control moisture\" in some inflators and worried that the company would not be able to assure the safety of the devices.\n\nIn an email the same year about pre-production quality testing of inflators built at the Monclova factory, a Takata manager expressed confusion to colleague about the causes of pervasive defects.\n\n\"I do not understand why we are failing every lot,\" he wrote.\n\nIn company documents, Takata engineers referred to the failures - when exploding inflators ruptured into metal fragments - as \"ED,\" for \"energetic disassembly.\"\n\nThe long-running scandal has overwhelmed the company's ability to furnish replacement parts as fast as automakers are forced to recall vehicles. A Takata competitor, airbag supplier Autoliv Inc, is also making replacements for recalled Takata inflators and recently told investors it expects to continue making those parts through 2017, one year longer than originally planned. More recalls would add more delays.\n\nRegulators have so far tried to direct replacement inflators to older vehicles that were operated in hot, humid parts of the country, because ammonium nitrate becomes unstable when contaminated by moisture and can cause the inflators to rupture.\n\nNHTSA officials have said the agency prioritizes recalls for the inflators it believes are most dangerous because the company has limited capacity to replace them. Customers often wait months to get the vehicles fixed after a recall notice.\n\nThe inflators already recalled are considered among the most dangerous because they do not contain a drying agent, NHTSA officials have said. All nine U.S. deaths linked to Takata airbag failures so far have involved those highest risk airbags, according to NHTSA records.\n\nTakata Chief Executive Shigehisa Takada last year apologized to victims and claimed responsibility for the dangerous defects.\n\nThe most recent death report came on Dec. 22, when Joel Knight, 52, drove his 2006 Ford Ranger pickup into a cow on a rural road near his home in Kershaw, South Carolina. He died after shrapnel from a ruptured airbag inflator pierced his neck, the family's attorney wrote in a filing with NHTSA.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, Takata confirmed the inflator ruptured in the crash and that it was made in Monclova in 2005, but the company did not specifically link the failure to Knight's death.\n\nShortly after the crash, the company declared 5.4 million more inflators defective.", "I happen to be a BMW fan and have owned kept an M car in the garage for many years now, in addition to extensively driving all consumer M vehicles. Many folks have made claims to BMW losing its way when it comes to the purist definition of an enthusiast vehicle that doesn't let modern-day technology and excessive weight diminish its road-connected traits. While I mostly understand some of the recent gripes, BMW probably deserves some merits on their latest M car, the all-new M2 - which is said to bring back some of that enthusiastic driving passion we loved in the late 80's up through the mid-2000s.\n\nAfter looking over the many reviews from the recent BMW M2 press days where journalists from all over the world got a hands-on experience with the M2 at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, the results have all concluded positively in favor of the old spirit of M returning.\n\nLet's face it; we will never see the E30 M3 restitution in any shape or form. As we inch towards full automation when it comes to our transportation, technology is getting a place in the driver's seat - literally. What BMW has done with the M2 is put their best efforts forward to bundle up a 3,450-pound package that can permit rowing of your own six forward gears and thrash around a track with some sense of where the front and rear end is pointed. With 365 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque (at 1,450 rpm up to 4,750 rpm) at its beckon, thanks to a nicely-tuned 3.0-liter dual-scroll turbocharged inline 6-cylinder engine with as much as 369 lb-ft of torque from a temporary overboost feature, the new BMW M2 is something different from the 1M coupe. The M2 is its own unique character, as some have put it, one that touts superb handling and faintly twitches at the touch of its relatively lightweight steering rack thanks to such a short wheelbase.\n\nThe new M2 also makes it to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds with the 6-speed manual transmission, and 4.2 seconds when equipped with the 7-speed DCT (dual-clutch transmission). Top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph.\n\nI will go out to say that the new BMW M2 is the return of true BMW Motorsport for public roads and weekend track thrashing in a compact but stout wrapper.\n\nThe question remains, is the all-new BMW M2 what we want over the M3/M4? Check out some of the latest test drive review videos on the new M2 and make up your mind before you strap behind the wheel of one.\n\nThe 2016 BMW M2 starts at a price of $52,695 and is on sale in April 2016.\n\nMore from Automotive Addicts to Check Out", "Wheelbase stretch and extra doors could hold key to production green light.\n\nRating\n\nStar Star Star Star No-Star Buick\n\nBuyer's Guide Get Quote\n\nIf Buick's glamorous Avista concept is approved for production, it will be as a four-door coupe. That's the hot tip from insiders who confirm a model of a four-door Avista exists inside GM's design studios in Warren, Mich.\n\nAfter the Avista concept's reveal on the eve of the 2016 North American International Auto Show, GM execs were quick to point out any decision to put the car into production would depend on developing a viable business case. The Avista concept has a lot of enthusiastic supporters inside GM, including chairman and CEO Mary Barra, but many believe stretching the wheelbase and adding a couple of doors is key to getting the car approved for production.\n\nMore practical than a regular coupe and less staid than a regular sedan, four-door coupes, pioneered in the modern era by the 2005 Mercedes-Benz CLS, have proven to be more than a short-lived fashion statement, having attracted a growing number of players since, from Porsche with the Panamera, to Volkswagen's CC, Audi's A7, and BMW's 6 Series Gran Coupe, which accounted for almost two-thirds of 6 Series sales in 2015. And more are coming: Jaguar is said to be working on a four-door coupe to replace the XK now that it has the F-Type to offer its sports car customers.\n\nCompared with a conventional coupe, a four-door offers the prospect of relatively stable sales volumes over a longer time period, plus the opportunity to position Buick alongside premium brands in one of the few non-SUV vehicle segments that has shown growth over the past decade. An Avista four-door coupe is therefore seen by supporters inside GM as a safer bet than the two-door.\n\nMaking the Avista a four-door coupe would also give Buick a vehicle format that's unique in the GM product portfolio. \"I think we've earned the right to have the halo car in the Buick range,\" says Duncan Aldred, vice president of Buick and GMC. Buick marketing manager Rob Peterson says, \"A lot of smart people are looking at it.\"\n\nWith sales of 1.25 million vehicles last year, Buick is now GM's second-best-selling brand worldwide after Chevrolet, and with the addition of the Envision SUV to the lineup, the Buick range is now composed of three sedans and three SUVs in the largest-volume segments in the industry. Significantly, Aldred makes it clear that when the Opel Insignia-based Cascada convertible, Buick's current halo car, reaches the end of its lifecycle -- probably three years from now -- it will be replaced with a new car.\n\nAlthough the two-door Avista show car is built on a mashup of GM Alpha and Omega parts, a production version would likely use the Alpha architecture that underpins Cadillac's ATS and CTS and the new Chevy Camaro. Alpha gives GM a lot of flexibility in terms of powertrains and vehicle dimensions.\n\nExterior designer Chip Thole says the Avista bubbled out of the studio to explore Buick's bandwidth after the Avenir sedan went after the elegant end of the spectrum. Thole says the Avista concept was created to be a lightning rod for the brand and stretch the sporty side of Buick \"for here and abroad.\" Although its 110-inch wheelbase makes it smaller than the full-size Avenir, Thole insists it would still be possible to add two more doors. He wanted the purity of a two-door coupe for the concept and says it was designed that way from the outset.\n\nChina, which accounts for about 80 percent of total Buick sales, is a critical factor in any decision to build the Avista, be it a two- or four-door. But GM does not have to rely solely on demand from China and North America, the only two markets in which Buick is sold, to make a production car viable. The Alpha architecture and Avista's design language, including the reimagined Buick grille, mean it could easily be marketed in Europe as an Opel and right-hand-drive versions sold in Britain and Australia as Vauxhalls and Holdens.\n\nThe Avista concept featured GM's new 400-hp, twin-turbo, 3.0-liter V-6 under the hood mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. This would likely be the default powertrain choice for the U.S. market and for premium versions of the car elsewhere, with all-wheel drive available as an option. GM's 275-hp, 2.0-liter turbo-four could be the base engine for all markets outside the U.S., and performance versions could use a variant of the 464-hp, 3.6-liter V-6 from Cadillac's ATS-V. Alpha also means a six-speed manual could be made available.\n\nThere'll be no V-8 Avista, though. GM sources say the Avista engine bay has not been protected for the 6.2-liter small-block even though it's used in the Alpha-based Camaro.", "BMW DTM drivers Timo Glock and Augusto Farfus take the BMW M2 Pace Cars at Laguna Seca for a drifting session.

The previously rumored BMW X3 M and ...\n\nOur source in Munich says BMW is preparing two launch two model M SUV models in the future. The previously rumored BMW X3 M and X4 M are in the planning stages and will join the X5 M and X6 M high-performance SUVs. The X3 M carries the F97 internal designation while the F98 codename was assigned to the X4 M.\n\nBMW X3 M\n\nTo compete with the Audi RS Q5 and Mercedes GLC 55 AMG, the X3 M is based on the next generation midsize SUV. The new X3 has grown in size and strives for a more powerful appearance. Compared to the current model, the 2017 X3 is expected but slim down almost 100 kilograms, thanks to a new rear-wheel drive platform and lightweight materials.\n\nSources say the front-end present itself flatter, yet beefier than the current model and with a new set of LED headlights. A character line runs from the front wheel arch on both door handles to the rear lights, which - are finally running used full LED technology.\n\nThe F97 X3 M will sport the typical M design, with an aggressive front fascia including a sculpted bumper and large air curtains, along with flared wheel arches and a lower stance.\n\nThe driving dynamics and exterior design have always been a selling point for the X3 family, but the interior somewhat lacked that premium feel many customers requested. BMW seems to have learned a lesson here and the new X3 is likely to be not only technologically advanced, but also more luxurious.\n\nThe true M variant would be powered by a 3.0 liter inline-six turbocharged engine delivering close to 500 horsepower. The G01 X3 will be introduced before the end of 2017 and it's currently being tested in the Northern parts of Europe.\n\nBMW X4 M\n\nThe F98 X4 M will be based on the current generation X4 and will sit above the recently unveiled - and fun to drive - BMW X4 M40i. Just like the X3 M, the M version of the X4 will sport a beefed-up design with aggressive lines and the usual M iconic design elements. Same powerplant is likely to end up under the hood with a similar 500 hp output. Both compact M SUVs will cater to a small niche of customers looking for practicality, performance and all-wheel drive experience in a compact Sports Utility Vehicle.", "Police arrested a man at the scene of an incident in the Glengormley area of Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, in which four people were injured.\n\nOfficers had been in pursuit of a silver BMW, after it failed to stop on the Ballyclare Road around 1.30am on Sunday.\n\nThe driver turned on to the Antrim Road, and ended up colliding with a silver Peugeot at the Hightown Road junction.\n\nFour people were taken to hospital for treatment for a range of injuries - none of which were believed to be life threatening.\n\nThe PSNI said: \"We are appealing for anyone who was travelling between the Ballyclare Road and the Antrim Road/Hightown Road areas during the early hours of Sunday and saw a silver BMW 3 series, to contact us on the non-emergency number 101.\"", "Ducati brass are not quite ready to confirm next year's bike offerings, but they are saying that the Scrambler Ducati line is not done yet and they're looking to go big or go home.\n\nhttp://lanesplitter.jalopnik.com/first-ride-the...\n\nThis week is the world launch of the Scrambler Sixty-Two, the 400 cc version of Ducati's Scrambler, in Barcelona. We Americans are getting our own even at the end of March, so you'll have to wait until then to hear about the bike.\n\nBut Visordown, which happens to be in Barcelona, is reporting that project manager Federico Sabbioni had some very interesting things to say during the trip:\n\nWe've got the engines, there is room to make something bigger. We'll see, we have a number of ideas and we're thinking about it... there is a volcano of ideas.\n\nI think we will continue to apply this kind of engine, we have in the past made a number of different displacements of this engine so we have experience and room to do a different version in terms of engine sizing. There's great possibility to stretch the brand with the 800cc engine, then of course there's also the possibility to make the bigger engine.\n\nSo why assume an 1100 cc Scrambler? Ducati isn't likely to develop an all-new motor for a bike like this, which means their options are sparse. The 1000 cc motor from the Sport Classic 1000 is an absolute gem but, with the current landscape of competition, they'd likely go bigger.\n\nThe 1100 cc from the 2012 Monster Evo makes more sense against the BMW R nineT, Moto Guzzi Griso, and new Triumph Bonneville T120/Triumph Thruxton. Obviously, they'll still need to do some tinkering to make it Euro 4 compliant and tune it more appropriately for the application, but it would be a good fit.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't want anything bigger than the 803 cc motor in the current Scrambler, but that's not very American of me. Would you?", "2 user comments | Views : 538 | Category: Spy News | Source: | SOURCE: www.autocar.co.uk\n\nThe BMW 8 Series name will be resurrected on a new flagship model as part of moves to provide greater competition to long-time adversary Mercedes-Benz and its S-Class coup\u00e9, as well as the Bentley Continental GT .\n\nThe new 8 Series, tentatively due in 2020, is planned to be a technological flagship with driveline components, multi-material architecture, electrical system and connectivity solutions closely related to those used by the recently introduced sixth-generation 7 Series. It will be built at BMW's Dingolfing factory in Germany from 2020, according to sources with knowledge of the German car maker's future production plans.", "Cadillac has a dealer problem. It has three times as many of them as Mercedes or BMW but sells less than half as many cars as either one. About 400 of Cadillac's more then 950 dealers sell 50 cars or less a year. Their Cadillac operations are combined with selling Chevrolets, Buicks, and GMC trucks. In many cases, the sales staff is poorly trained to sell Cadillacs and Caddy owners are forced to rub elbows in the service department lounge with people who have just finished hauling a load of manure in their Jimmies.\n\nCadillac President Johan de Nysschen has a better idea. According to Automotive News, he wants those small dealers to shut down their regular sales operations entirely and transition to a \"virtual showroom\" model. Instead of stocking Cadillacs on site, new cars would be delivered from regional inventory centers. Trained salespeople would routinely visit prospective buyers at their homes or workplaces. They would bring with them touch screen vehicle configurators or virtual reality units supplied by Cadillac.\n\n\"We want to work with those small dealers to give Cadillac a competitive advantage in terms of reach into their local communities,\" de Nysschen said in an interview last week, \"but do so in a way that's more closely aligned with what we think the Cadillac luxury brand experience should be.\"\n\nOne advantage De Nysschen sees it that many of the lowest volume dealers are located in small towns, places where Mercedes, BMW, and Audi usually have no presence at all. De Nysschen wants to leverage that local aspect while dramatically improving the sales experience. He doesn't like the idea of selling Cadillacs as an afterthought out the back door while more popular GM brands are featured up front.\n\nIt's a way to \"immerse customers in a virtual brand experience, so that our dealers need not concern themselves with investing in showrooms and brand-element requirements, which clearly are cumbersome if you're such a small dealer,\" de Nysschen says. He believes customers will appreciate the personal and high-tech treatment and dealers will like not paying local property taxes and floor plan interest on a dozen of more slow selling cars.\n\nNot all dealers are thrilled with the idea. Some see the plan as yet another nefarious scheme to prune dealers from GM's bloated sales distribution network, just as it tried to do when the company went bankrupt in 2009. \"How does having fewer Cadillacs on display at dealerships in all of these communities help sales?\" asked Byron Hansen. His dealership in Brigham City, Utah sold about 30 Cadillacs last year, along with a few hundred Chevys, Buicks and GMCs. \"It makes you wonder what they're trying to accomplish.\"\n\nJim Stutzman, owner of a Chevrolet and Cadillac dealership in Winchester, Va., is more upbeat but still has questions. He is leery of being left with no inventory and the prospect of having to tell his high end customers they have to wait. \"In this day and age, with customers' propensity to want immediate gratification,\" Stutzman said, \"I don't know how you can compete if you don't have product available.\"\n\nApparently, Stutzman has not heard of Tesla Motors, whose customers are happy to order cars online and wait months for them to be manufactured and delivered. The problem with De Nyssschen's plan may not be that it goes too far but rather that it doesn't go far enough.", "It was a Kawasaki Racing Team 1-2 on day one of the two-day test at Phillip Island with Tom Sykes leading his teammate Jonathan Rea in the final shakedown test prior to the start of the World Superbike season on February 26 in Australia. Even though it's supposed to be summer Down Under, the weather was more like England as it rained on and off, making it difficult for most of the riders to get some solid testing in.\n\nAs to how he fared on day one of the test, Sykes said: \"Better than the weather. It's been hit or miss in both of our sessions, lost a lot of track time.\"\n\nIn the end, the former champ wasn't too bothered by it, leading the way with a 1:31.097. Sykes felt that the homework they did leading up to the pre-race test at Phillip Island had them in a good spot.\n\n\"The saving grace is that the Kawasaki racing team have had a good winter test schedule,\" Sykes said. \"We're definitely ahead of the game and the beauty is that we've got a good base setting and we were able to work around the weather today. So overall I'm happy.\"\n\nSyke's teammate Jonathan Rea agreed that the team was at a good level, but cautioned that there he still had work to do, especially since he was coming to terms with the new machine. He has received a little help in Australia, though.\n\n\"The bike and team's at a really good level, but we have a new bike let's not forget,\" Rea said. \"I'm still learning how to get the best out of that. We arrived here with a slightly different engine character for me, which is the biggest thing for me, I'm finding the bike much more manageable, lets me do a little bit more my style, like I want to ride. That's given me confidence.\"\n\nAlso confident was the young Michael van der Mark on the Honda World Superbike Team. The Dutchman led the way in the morning session, a time that held up as third overall.\n\n\"I love this track, it suits the bike,\" Van der Mark said about his surge in confidence. \"I also think it's the one-year experience I have from last that makes me more calm and more relaxed.\"\n\nIn fourth was last year's Rookie of the Year Jordi Torres on the Althea BMW, ahead of American Nicky Hayden on the other Honda World Superbike. Hayden was .461 of a second off of Sykes' fast time.\n\nNext up was the Pata Yamaha duo of Sylvain Guintoli and Alex Lowes, finishing the day in sixth and seventh, respectively. Barni Racing Ducati's Xavi Fores bested the factory duo in eighth, while Aruba.it Ducati's Chaz Davies and Davide Giugliano completed the top 10.\n\nThe weather promises to be quite hot tomorrow, so many are hoping to get some race simulations in as well as test the bikes in hot conditions.", "Motor dealer Peter Vardy is launching a portfolio of classic cars with values of up to \u00a3250,000 at its Heritage dealership in County Durham.\n\nThe rarely-seen vehicles, considered among the finest examples of manufacturing excellence, are being sold at www.petervardyheritage.co.uk , as the company positions itself within the world of prestige and classic car retailing.\n\nA new Heritage service is also being launched, featuring a dedicated concierge department offering personalised expert advice on investment, value creation, restoration, storage, maintenance and transportation.\n\nThe Peter Vardy Heritage team is being headed up by renowned classic car specialist Paul Cummings, who worked for Sir Peter Vardy for 16 years as a dealer principal in the company's Rolls Royce and Bentley, Ferrari Maserati and Jaguar franchises.\n\nHe said: \"This is an exciting new departure for the Peter Vardy Group, which is one of the most trusted names in the automotive industry.\n\n\"The Heritage team has assembled an absolutely fantastic collection of truly great cars, backed by the ultimate VIP service to ensure that every detail of our clients' motoring desire is fulfilled.\n\n\"Classic cars not only offer great investment benefits, but can be driven and enjoyed without affecting their value.\n\n\"You could buy a classic car for \u00a370,000 and in five years' time it could be worth \u00a3145,000.

While that car is probably viewed through rose-tinted glasses, as it wasn't as fantastic as it's made out to be, it's still a fan-favorite and a replacement has been strongly lobbied for. BMW has been toying with our emotions on the subject for the past few years, teasing us with rumors and concepts only to later deny the plans for such a car.\n\nHowever, this may all change, as Autocar has some new information from BMW's R&D center in Munich that suggests an 8 Series replacement may be on its way and make a debut in 2020.\n\nA new BMW 8 Series would likely serve as the brand's flagship, in terms of both technology and luxury, being the ultimate in luxury grand touring. According to some insiders in Munich, BMW has two different layout ideas for the upcoming 8 Series and both of them have been put in front of Harald Krueger, BMW's CEO, who is currently in the works of expanding BMW's model lineup near the top, with the addition of new luxury vehicles to compete with Mercedes-Benz's S Class Coupe.\n\nThe two different layouts include one that is similar to the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe that we all know and love, but bigger and far more luxurious. This would actually be an interesting idea, because it would be something different that the S Class Coupe and would look unbelievably good. There's also a traditional Coupe and Convertible layout, to compete directly with the S Class Coupe, with even higher levels of luxury than the 7 Series.\n\nBut the need for such a car is real for BMW, as Mercedes pushed 125,000 S Class models last year, many of them Coupes. Having an additional model for BMW to compete with the S Class Coupe would help considerably, as without one, BMW is losing potential sales with every single S Class Coupe sold. Such an 8 Series vehicle would be a low-volume, high-profit car that would be the face and flagship vehicle for BMW. According to a source inside BMW, \"With the decision to bring back the 8 Series, Krueger is looking at a potentially lucrative revenue stream with high profitability on a per unit basis,\"\n\nRegarding which direction BMW decides to take with the upcoming 8 Series, we will likely find out in 2018 with a concept. Such a car would have large shoes to fill, as the 8 Series has become almost immortalized in the eyes of many enthusiasts. However, if the new 7 Series is anything to go buy, being that the upcoming 8 Series will share architecture, technology and luxury with the 7er, it should be one helluva car.

However, one thing is glaringly absent from ...\n\nBMW M GmbH is a subsidiary of BMW AG and is well known for its high performance Bimmers. However, one thing is glaringly absent from the firm's portfolio and that is a BMW with only two wheels. Particularly at this time, when Mercedes' sport division, AMG, is strengthening its relationship and association with MV Agusta, now might be the right time for an ///M motorcycle to make its debut.\n\nBMW Motorrad has, in the past, offered higher performance or more track oriented machines but BMW has yet to capitalize on the ///M brand's powerful reputation on a motorcycle model. The latest 'High Performance' vehicle from BMW Motorrad was the HP4. The HP4 was a highly exclusive and track oriented version of the greatly successful S 1000 RR. It utilized upgraded materials when compared with the standard version, as well.\n\nWhereas the HP4 could have been considered as a full ///M model, a vehicle like the K 1300 S Motorsport Edition could be thought of as being more akin to an ///M sport model. Point being, BMW already sees that its customers want sportier versions of its motorcycles. Offering ///M versions of existing models, as well as specifically ///M exclusive models, much like the HP2 or, for example, a vehicle like the M1 where there isn't a non-M version of the vehicle, would not only be the proverbial genesis of the association between BMW M and BMW Motorrad but it would also open up the opportunity to begin to offer ///M badged parts and upgrades for previous models.\n\nCreating a relationship between the two subsidiary brands appears, to me, to be a no brainer. Both brands represent, to the greatest extent, the true essence of the BMW brand, which is performance, riding/driving pleasure. As both brands have become legendary in their own right, I'm rather surprised that there hasn't been an ///M motorcycle as of yet. Hopefully, that will change.", "If you were to take a look at the BMW lineup at the end of the 20th century, you probably couldn't have guessed that the ...\n\nIf you were to take a look at the BMW lineup at the end of the 20th century, you probably couldn't have guessed that the Germans would end up having more than twice the number of models available just 15 years later. And yet, here we stand, with all sorts of niches and new segments that were hard to imagine a few years back.\n\nYou might've also noticed that the Bavarians seem to stay true to their heritage and DNA, and that they prefer to refine a product over many incarnations rather than coming up with something radically new. This strategy has allowed them to rise to success, with cars like the 3 Series, 5 Series and 7 Series that have a long history behind them and carried the heavy burden of success over decades. It was thanks to them that the premium image, brand and BMW moniker became what it is today - a highly respectable marque around the world.\n\nThis proves that innovation and taking bold steps is sometimes the only way forward. And if we were to take a closer look at the Germans' history books, we'd notice that bringing out new ideas isn't necessarily something new or atypical.\n\nWhen the Neue Klasse range was launched, it was absolutely stunning and non-conventional - ahead of its time if you will. It was the same with the 3 Series, which was the first sports sedan of its kind back in the late 1970s. If you're familiar with the history of the brand, you would see that these indeed rose to incredible new heights in terms of popularity and success. So BMW isn't doing anything special these days since they've been delivering niche models since the early days of its existence.\n\nJust like the Gran Coupe version of the 4er, the X4 is - for the moment - fairly criticized by pundits. Being marketed as a Sports Activity Coupe model doesn't help either, especially since it is relying on the bad name the BMW X6 received when it was originally launched. However, just like the new F16 model is showing us, there may be hope out there for the X4 too. Even though the original Coupe SUV from BMW was booed early on by 'old fans of the brand', it did sell in over 250,000 units over the course of its first production run.\n\nThe second generation launched last year is a great improvement and that only goes to show that the age-old recipe of refining a product through the years, is still in play. The X4, on the other hand, is a first but it's a promising proposition.\n\nBased on the F25 X3, the F26 X4 is, by all possible definitions, a Sports Activity Coupe too, with a sloping roofline and a more complicated rear end than the model it's based on. Up to the B-Pillar, you'd have a really hard time distinguishing between the two but after that things get a lot easier. The rear doors have a completely different profile up top, to adhere to the sloping roofline therefore offering less headroom for rear-seating passengers.\n\nViewed from behind, you start to see why it came alive. Its brother isn't ugly either, the typical BMW ethos in design being applied to it as well but the X4 takes a bold step towards a more chic proposition. It is, if you will, the fashionista choice. The celebrities that already bought it so far seem to confirm it but there's more essence to this car than you may think. This is also part of a new way of building autos, one that pays more attention to efficiency, as it downright should.\n\nIf we're to ignore the recently launched M Performance version of the X4, the BMW M40i, the xDrive35d we had for testing purposes is the fastest in the range with a sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) that takes just 5.2 seconds. That's a measly 0.3 seconds slower than the top of the range version and a whole lot more efficient. Unfortunately, the BMW X4 xDrive35d isn't available in the US right now. The BMW X4 xDrive35d comes with a 3.0 liter twin-turbo diesel engine that makes no less than 313 HP and 630 Nm (465 lb-ft) of torque, numbers clearly outranking those of the xDrive35i.\n\nOur tester, just like any other X4 you can buy right now, used the old N57 engine that is about to be replaced by the B57 units found in newer models like the 730d we sampled a while back. Even so, the inline 6-cylinder heart of the thing is a thing of finesse, with a silky smooth feel to it that will simply make you fall in love. Forget about the old 2.0 liter four-cylinder diesels, this is completely different. You can also erase from your mind other 3.0 liter V6 diesels from rivaling manufacturers, the inline-6 configuration makes a whole lot of a difference.\n\nIdling is refined - whenever you get to experience it, because the automatic Start/Stop feature will make sure you don't - and accelerating hard brings out a hum that will make you appreciate the fine engineering that went into it.\n\nThis beast doesn't play around. Even though the SAC tips the scale at 1,860 kg (4,101 lbs), it's not a slouch. Get the M Sport Package and the 8-speed gearbox with Launch Control will put you back in the seat. It's not just straight line performance that impresses either. It's the all-round package. Even though under the sheet metal, the X3 and X4 should be identical, somehow the Coupe feels a bit sharper and more planted than its more utilitarian brother. We were rather impressed with how sure-footed this thing was. The xDrive system sends the power to either corner of the car, depending on the needs of the vehicle and the driving conditions, but when you push it hard, the electronic nannies keep you in check, offering a rather disappointing understeering feeling when you're at about 6 tenths.\n\nTake things to the limit and everything starts falling into place. Even though this was a diesel, it felt alive and agile all the time. The torque is abundant and BMW claims you get access to all of it from 1,500 RPM which is almost as low as idle. Driving the X4 xDrive35d certainly emphasizes that feeling, as the back-breaking force makes its way from the engine bay to your spine.\n\nOf course, that doesn't apply to driving in Eco Pro mode which in return will get you 24.7 mpg (9.5 l/100 km) around town which is downright impressive. Cruising on the highway, we saw that figure rise to over 30 mpg (7.7 l/100 km) with an average speed of 75 mph (120 km/h) which is respectable considering the size of the car and the engine.\n\nTake the X4 through a set of tight bends and you'll notice that it's as stable as it gets without the M letter stuck on the boot - the true M letter, not the one that comes with the M Sport package, by the way. It will do great in most driving situations, but what's a bit disappointing is that the rear differential has torque vectoring only thanks to a gimmick that brakes the inside wheel when needed. That's more and more often used in the industry these days and while it's decent, it doesn't come close to the feeling the old xDrive systems had, pushing the rear end outwards and the nose into the corner.\n\nEven so, if you're looking for more driving thrills, you should go for the M40i model that will surely cater to those needs.\n\nJust as the Bavarians claimed from the get-go, the X4 wants to be nothing more than a smaller, cheaper alternative of the X6, for people that want to make an impression. And that's just what it is.\n\nUnfortunately, you can see it inside, as the interior is dated, being stuck in 2010, and basically identical with the one used on the X3. The materials used are of the premium selection but the look of the whole cabin shows somewhat outdated. Another downside is the rear visibility being drastically limited, an issue fortunately helped by the inclusion of parking sensors as standard.\n\nWhat surprised us, in a good way, was the fact that you have plenty of room in the back. If you ever rode inside a BMW E71 X6 you probably know that if you were close to or taller than 6 feet (184 cm) you'd have a hard time traveling in comfort in the back. Well, that's not an issue inside the X4, the wizards in Munich addressed this inconvenience and headroom is fairly acceptable.\n\nNo matter how you look at it - considering the compact size of this SUVish - plenty has been achieved with little at hand. For those looking to make a statement, the BMW X4 xDrive35d is a good compromise between driving dynamics, premium looks and pricing. If there was ever a car out there that appealed to a niche of a niche, this is it. Success will be hard to come by but those that will buy an X4, will surely be madly and absolutely in love with it.", "(Bloomberg) -- Carmakers are becoming a familiar sight at tech shows, where theyre rolling out new models to woo a generation of consumers who question the need for a car that only gets them from A to B.\n\nAt this weeks Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Ford Motor Co. unveiled a new vehicle for Europe as well as in-cockpit technology, Volvo is showing off a keyless car and Mercedes-Benz Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton will appear on a panel with the president of chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nEager to win over millennials who may care more about the latest Apple Inc. iPhone than a redesigned Mustang, automakers are trying to become more tech-savvy and shed their image as 20th century metal benders. The pivot toward the younger set comes amid a slowdown in China, competition from Tesla Motors Inc. -- which sends automatic software updates to the cars command center -- and a boom in ride-sharing services such as Uber that have left car companies anxious about growth and eager to try out a new crop of digital products and services.\n\nCarmakers have a very narrow window of opportunity to win over Generation Y,said Richard Viereckl, an analyst at PwC in Frankfurt who co-authored a 2015 study on connected cars. Theyre at these technology shows to portray their brands as hip, and with mounting competition from the likes of Apple, Panasonic and Sony, theyre fighting to keep the attention of and access to their customers.\n\nBy 2022, 345 million autos worldwide will be connected to the Internet, nearly four times more than last year, according to IHS Automotive. In six years, 98 percent of the cars sold globally will be connected, up from 30 percent last year, the consulting firm said. The trend is driven by customer demand: Three in four consumers said they consider connected car services an important feature in their next vehicle purchase, AT&T Inc. and Ericsson said in a report in October.\n\nThe risk for carmakers is that Apple, Google and Microsoft Corp. will conquer the connected-car business with operating systems and apps that people are familiar with. Google and Apple already offer in-car infotainment systems with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and Google is at the forefront of developing self-driving cars.\n\nGoogle and Apple have a good chance as anyone at grabbing the car ecosystem, said Kevin Curran, a computer science professor at Ulster University in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. \"Cars today are computers with wheels, and tech companies know that field all too well.\n\nTo fend off the threat, carmakers are set to make big decisions over the next 24 months, striking cooperation pacts and increasing spending on research and development as well as M&A to get ahead, said Thilo Koslowski, who heads the auto practice at researcher Gartner Inc. Those who dont are at risk of being left behind, he said.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. debuted its Chevrolet Bolt electric car at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, before taking it to the Detroit auto show a week later. Such moves are aimed at highlighting vehicles software and Web features, with carmakers adding iPad-like dashboard touch screens and moving beyond to even more futuristic systems.\n\nGerman automakers BMW AG, Audi AG and Daimler AG last year teamed up to buy Nokia Oyjs HERE map business, a response to Google and Apple. BMWs iDrive system brings apps, radio and navigation to the dashboard, reducing knobs and buttons for a user experience thats closer to that of a smartphone. Porsches Mission E concept car unveiled last year features eye-tracking and gesture-control functions, which include holograms that allow the driver to grab apps out of the air.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress, Ford introduced a new model of the Kuga sport utility vehicle for the European market with updated communications, entertainment and driver-assistance features. It also outlined its latest plans under the umbrella of Ford Smart Mobility, the companys initiative encompassing areas such as connectivity, autonomous vehicles and big data.\n\nWe are transitioning from an auto company to an auto and mobility company, Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fieldssaid in a Bloomberg TV interview at the event on Monday. The company is tripling its engineering investment in technologies making cars more semi-autonomous, Fields said.\n\nIts a tall order for automakers contending with fleet-footed tech companies. The disruption brought by the connected car is similar to what happened 100 years ago, when the automobile successfully challenged the horse and carriage industry, Koslowski said. Engineering excellence isnt enough anymore, but to appeal to the next generation of buyers a carmaker needs to show how it can enrich a consumers digital lifestyle, he said.\n\n\"Automakers have an opportunity to make cars even more compelling and spark a renaissance of the car,\" Koslowskisaid. \"They are being challenged and they have to be careful that they dont turn into a horse and carriage industry.\n\n--With assistance from Richard Weiss and David Welch To contact the reporters on this story: Stefan Nicola in Berlin at snicola2@bloomberg.net, Keith Naughton in Southfield, Michigan at knaughton3@bloomberg.net.

Contemporary passengers cars are safe, fast, reliable, and everything else except for one thing - they're full of technologies that separate the driver from the act of driving. It's no secret that keen drivers with enough room in the garage prefer to enjoy those brief moments of freedom behind the wheel of older cars such as the ones included in the following list.\n\nRetro automobiles made in the '50s and '60s are getting more and more expensive with each passing day, the reason why most people in the market for a blast from the past tend to opt for cars built in the late '80s and early '90s. The best argument, however, is that cars built right after George H. W. Bush was elected the 41st President of the United States don't cut back on creature comforts.\n\nThink about the prospect of using a 1960s MG or Alfa Romeo as a daily driver or for longer journeys than driving to the nearest supermarket for a carton of milk. Given the circumstances, it's a given that cars made in the 1990s offer just the right balance between the burnished old school and the new kids on the block.\n\nThe cars featured in the following list are at least 25 years old, which means that they're legal to import in the United States. People living in Cali have to think twice before spending their money on this kind of car because there's an additional hurdle of making your import CARB compliant. And as you can imagine, compliance work is very costly.\n\nOf the 10 cars that made our list, two are German, one was born in Italy, one is British, one is Italian, and five are Japanese. And no, I'm not a JDM fanatic. Japanese automobiles account for half of the list because every manufacturer from the Land of the Rising Sun churned out fascinating products in that era.\n\nPropelled by the asset price bubble that was succeeded in 1991 by the so-called \"Lost Decade,\" Japan's automotive industry was a boiling kettle of wild and innovative ideas. Those and the European entries in the list are currently available at reasonable prices, and that's the ticket to ride for most prospective buyers. Without further ado, let's get going:\n\nNissan Skyline GT-R (R32)\n\nYou've seen this coming, and sure enough, the Nissan Skyline GT-R is a thoroughly special beast. After all, Australian publication Wheels coined the term \"Godzilla\" to describe the Japanese grand tourer. The R32 generation is similar to the 1980 Audi Quattro in an aspect. To be more specific, it's been built to dominate motorsport.\n\nThe race-prepped R32 GT-R never lost a race in the All Japan Championships series, and that racing pedigree shows in the road-legal configuration of the damn thing. 276 horsepower from 2.6 liters, motorsport-oriented all-wheel-drive, and blistering performance is the name of the game here. A good example of the R32 will set you back at least $20,000. If you fancy the R33 GT-R more than the R32 GT-R, you'll have to wait until 2020 to legally import one in the U. S. of A.\n\nBMW 850i\n\nFew grand tourers are as aesthetically stimulating as the BMW E31. When it was launched, the 8 Series was the flagship model in the German manufacturer's stable. The M70B50 engine of the 850i is a real treat considering that an evolution called S70/2 is the engine that motivates the fastest passenger car of the '90s - the McLaren F1.\n\nBMW doesn't make an 8 Series anymore because of the global recession of the 1990s. Only 7,232 units were sold in the U.S. over seven years, and the price for an entry-level 840i started at just over $70,000. These days, an 850i in tip-top condition starts at $30,000.\n\nHonda Beat\n\nBrace yourselves because this is one weird car. Despite its size and the fact that it's underpowered, the last model to be approved by Soichiro Honda is a genuine modern classic. As a rear-wheel-drive, mid-engined, two-seat roadster, the Honda Beat ticks the right boxes for a kei car with sporty credentials. Have a wild stab in the dark with guessing the kind of engine that gets the Beat to 84 mph (135 km/h).\n\nYup, it's a 0.6-liter three-cylinder with 63 horsepower on tap. But then again, the Honda Beat doesn't need much oomph to lug around a curb weight of 1,675 pounds (760 kilograms). Around 33,600 units were made from 1991 to 1996. These things are hard to find for sale in the United States, yet a low-mileage example can be bought from Japan for the equivalent of 10,000 bucks. Cheap thrills? Hell yeah.\n\nMercedes-Benz S-Class (W140)\n\nThe W140 series Mercedes-Benz S-Class is widely considered to be the final generation of the old-fashioned S-Class brood. North American sales started in 1991, which is why it's easy to find one on eBay or Craigslist. A 1993 Mercedes-Benz S600 Guard Edition was bought by Matt Farah from The Smoking Tire for $2,500. What that means is a luxury sedan that lost 98 percent of its original retail price.\n\nWith a top speed of 179 mph (288 km/h) with the limiter removed and a 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) sprint of 5.5 seconds, the W140 S600 is a lot of car for a handful of green dollar bills. If you find one with the AMG aftermarket power upgrade, your right foot will control whatever is left of the original 439 horsepower and 460 lb-ft (623 Nm) of torque.\n\nNissan Figaro\n\nWhere do I start with this neo-retro midget? Though not a kei car, the Nissan Figaro is on the small side of 2-door convertibles. Around 20,000 units were manufactured in 1991. In recent years, the Figaro has become a popular second-hand bargain in the U.K., Asia, and the United States to some extent. And yes, its name comes from the play and main character in The Marriage of Figaro by Pierre Beaumarchais.\n\nThe lightweight Japanese convertible boasts air conditioning, CD player, leather seats, the lot. Not bad for a car based on the first-gen Nissan Micra. The 987 cc inline-4 turbo engine isn't bad either, though don't expect blistering performance from it or the matching 3-speed automatic. $20,000 is the right price for one titled in the United States.\n\nLancia Delta Integrale 16-valve\n\nThe Delta needs no introduction thanks to its success in the WRC. The Fulvia won the International Championship for Manufacturers title in 1972, the Stratos won it three times, and the rear-wheel-drive 037 dominated the all-wheel-drive Audi Quattro in 1983. The Lancia Delta, on the other hand, won the WRC manufacturers' title six times in a row.\n\nThe rallying pedigree can be found in the 16-valve Delta Integrale model, which produces 200 horsepower from a 2-liter turbo. The AWD system of this Italian masterpiece is set up to split the engine's torque 47 percent front and 53 percent rear. Pricing can get ridiculously high provided that the car is in perfect working condition and highly original in terms of appearance. Those on a tighter budget can find one for $25,000, the price of a Chevrolet Camaro with the 2.0 turbo engine.\n\nMitsubishi 3000GT\n\nRemember the Dodge Stealth? It was a captive import with minor differences over the Mitsubishi 3000GT though the two were identical regarding mechanical features. For the early 1990s, the 3000GT was a highly impressive sports car thanks to wizardry such as AWD with all-wheel steering, active aero in the form of automatically adjusting front and rear spoilers, and an electronically controlled suspension system.\n\nThe downside to the 3000GT is that a fully loaded model tips the scales at approximately 3,800 pounds (1,723 kilograms). On the plus side, the 3.0 twin-turbo V6 engine with 320 horsepower and 315 lb-ft (427 Nm) aided the 3000GT with blasting the quarter mile in 13 seconds. Desirable examples such as the 3000GT VR-4 are hard to find in the United States. Given the circumstances, you're better off searching for a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T twin-turbo. I've found one on eBay with 943 miles (1,517 kilometers) on the odometer and a buy it now price of $32,800, which is top dollar for a highly original example.\n\nVauxhall Lotus Carlton\n\nautoevolution readers from Great Britain need no introduction to the Lotus Carlton. Manufactured by Vauxhall (and Opel) from 1990 to 1992, the Lotus Carlton could outgun the supercars of that era thanks to a 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) time of 5.1 seconds and a maximum speed of 177 mph (285 km/h). Based on the Vauxhall Carlton (Opel Omega) family sedan, the Lotus Carlton was sold in Imperial Green, which is a dark shade of green that appears black in anything but direct sunlight.\n\n950 units were made at \u00a348,000 a pop. That's $67,905 at current exchange rates, which is more than a BMW M3 costs in North America ($63,500). Searching through the British classifieds, good examples of the Lotus Carlton start at \u00a320,000 ($28,295). Compared to other hero cars of the 1990s, the Lotus Carlton is still relevant today thanks to the eye-watering performance offered by its 372 horsepower twin-turbo 3-liter straight-6 engine and world-renowned handling characteristics.\n\nMazda Eunos Cosmo\n\nLook at this thing. Look hard at this thing and try to guess what is so special about it. Let me help you with a little hint - the Mazda Eunos Cosmo is related to the RX-7. Yes, it's got a rotary under the hood, but not just any Wankel engine. Better still, it's the only Mazda model powered by a three-rotor engine. As if that wasn't enough to get you weak at the knees, the engine uses a pair of turbos for maximum smiles per gallon.\n\nOn the performance front, this luxury coupe from Japan was the bee's knees when it started production in 1990. The downside to the Eunos Cosmo is that it came with a sluggish 4-speed automatic. Fun fact - the Eunos Cosmo is the first production car to get built-in GPS navigation. 8,875 units were made and servicing this thing is a pain in the arse. The equivalent of $13,255 will buy you a tidy example of the breed. Vector in the shipping feer from Japan to the United States and the hardships that come with legal imports and you'll understand why you rarely see these things roaming the streets of North America.\n\nRenault Alpine A610\n\nIn 1991, the Renault Alpine GTA received its mid-cycle facelift and a new nameplate in the form of Renault Alpine A610. Alpine has been affiliated with the French manufacturer for many years, but the A610 was built and designed with Renault know-how. Compared to the exterior design of the GTA, only the glasshouse is carry-over. Abiding by the most purist Alpine creed (Alpine A110 Berlinette, anyone?), the French 2+2 coupe has its engine at the rear and the drive sent to the rear wheels.\n\nIn its most powerful tune, the turbocharged PRV V6 churned out 276 horsepower and 304 lb-ft (412 Nm) of torque. Full boost hits hard when the tachometer shows 2,500 rpm, translating into a surge of get-up-and-go. While mid-range acceleration was great, turbo lag is the defining character of all turbocharged cars of the late '80s and early '90s. A well-maintained Alpine A610 currently sells for nigh on \u20ac25,000 in the Old Continent, which translates to $27,530 at current exchange rates. The Porsche 944 Turbo S fetches $50,000 on eBay if it's in exceptional condition, making the Renault Alpine A610 a bargain by comparison.", "Cadillac Expects Chinese Sales To Grow 25 Percent In 2016 To Over 100,000 Vehicles\n\nGeneral Motors' prestige-luxury brand, Cadillac expects to increase its sales in China by 25 percent this year to over 100,000 units, Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen shared in a recent interview with Reuters.\n\nIn January, Cadillac commenced production of its CT6 full-size flagship sedan at a new factory in China. The CT6 joins the XTS and long-wheelbase ATS (called ATS-L) as the third Cadillac produced in China for sale in the local Chinese market.\n\n\"China is a very important part of the globalization of Cadillac, and we actually seek to establish China as a substantial second volume hub for the brand,\" de Nysschen said.\n\nde Nysschen believes that the possibility of China overtaking the U.S. as Cadillac's top sales market is \"a long way off\", possibly five to 10 years. That's understandable, given that Cadillac sold 175,267 new vehicles in the United States in 2015, nearly twice the amount it plans to sell in China this year.\n\nIn China, Cadillac faces stiff competition from well-established luxury brands from Germany -- BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi. Together, these brands account for the overwhelming majority of sales and, by association, market share.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the 2016 Cadillac CT6, Cadillac will introduce the 2017 XT5 midsize crossover. Like the CT6, the XT5 will be built locally in China for the Chinese market. The brand plans to launch four additional models in China by 2020, thereby doubling its locally-produced product offerings, said de Nysschen.\n\nGoing forward, de Nysschen explains, Cadillac plans to expand its product portfolio and \"aggressively' localize production. The new production facility, which currently only builds the CT6, can be expanded to produce 150,000 vehicles a year.\n\nIn China, Cadillac vehicles are manufactured and sold through a joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. (SAIC). Chinese commerce regulations require foreign automaker to form joint ventures with local automotive firms to produce vehicles inside the country. By contrast, importing vehicles into China results in high tariffs.\n\nGM has been importing the majority of Cadillac vehicles into China since commencing operations in the country, resulting in higher prices for the vehicles compared to the competition, sometimes by as much as 50 percent. The circumstance priced the vehicles out of the range that most Chinese luxury car buyers were willing to pay, thereby pushing them to Cadillac's rivals from Germany.", "The European markets ended the first session of the new trading week solidly in positive territory. The strong performance of the Asian markets and rising crude oil prices provided an early boost to investor sentiment. Mining and resource stocks also jumped due to rising iron ore prices. Investors largely shrugged off \"Brexit\" fears, but will keep a close eye on recent developments.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron struck a reform deal at a European Union summit on Friday that would give the UK \"special status\" in the EU. Meanwhile, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced over the weekend that he would campaign for a British exit from the EU. Cameron has set a June 23 date for referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.\n\nMarkets in Asia climbed Monday, as investors cheered news over the weekend that China's top securities regulator has been replaced. China removed the head of its securities regulator, Xiao Gang, and replaced him with Liu Shiyu, a veteran of China's central bank and chairman of Agricultural Bank of China, to oversee the world's second-largest stock market in the wake of last summer's slump that saw Xiao blamed for mismanagement.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chip stocks increased 2.19 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, added 1.66 percent.\n\nThe DAX of Germany climbed 1.98 percent and the CAC 40 of France rose 1.79 percent.

That soon may change, though, as Mini looks to build new volume models in addition to the Cooper Hardtop, Clubman, and Countryman.\n\n\"It is a question you have to look at economically, and around the world you could say the sedan has the biggest potential, volume-wise,\" Peter Schwarzenbauer, BMW board member in charge of Mini, told Automotive News. If Mini does offer a compact sedan, it would help add more compact models to the automaker's lineup made almost exclusively of subcompact vehicles. The redesigned 2016 Mini Clubman, which came out in January and grew a whopping 12 inches in length, is the automaker's first foray into the compact segment.\n\nWe heard previously that Mini wants its lineup to be leaner, consisting of four or five primary models. Mini has cut some fat over the last couple years, axing the Mini Coupe, Roadster, and Paceman. Mini is still considering a car based on the Superleggera electric roadster concept that debuted in 2014. A while back, we heard that Mini would bring the car to market in 2019. Schwarzenbauer does admit there are challenges in bringing the concept to production, namely when it comes to sales and price.\n\n\"As you know, halo cars are economically not always great. It is a trade-off: How much does it do for the brand, and how do you make it feasible?\" he said.\n\nWe do know Mini plans to launch a plug-in hybrid over the next two years. At this time, Mini won't say which model will receive the new system, though. In the longer term, Mini is also plotting an electric car, something \"Mini definitely needs,\" Schwarzenbauer said.\n\nSource: Automotive News (Subscription Required)", "This Audi leaked video reminds me of the Warcraft movie teaser they showed at behind closed doors and didn't want anybody to see after. Blizzard Entertainment hired lots of people to hunt down every copy on the Internet, and now Audi seems to be doing the same. Of course, the RS3 sedan is not as important as the movie, but it's the first creature of its kind and spearheads the new RS market offensive.\n\nDoes the picture taken by the monkey belong to the animal or the human who's camera he too? We don't know, but Audi is protecting the shape of it sports sedan. Last week, a couple of snapshots from this video were released. But now we have motion footage that also reveals the back end of the car. The low-resolution footage makes us feel as though we're back in 2005, but at least we have new details to show you.\n\nSpecifically, it's clear that RS3 sedan is influenced by the Audi Prologue coupe concept. Inside the front lower air intakes are smaller intakes with blades painted in red. The grille is also inspired by the prologue and from some angles it makes the car look squashed and wide.\n\nAround the back, the trunk features a discreet black or carbon fiber spoiler that won't scare the Subaru STI away. The diffuser is painted the same shade of silver as the front splitter, and the trademark dual oval exhaust tips come out a little more than they do on the RS3 hatchback.\n\nAs for the fender flares, they are there, but we totally understand why Audi fans say they let the car down. Compared to the BMW M2, this sedan looks too Jetta-like. Perhaps known the RS3 would be at a disadvantage, the Audi of America official said on stage that the 2.5-liter TFSI will have up to 400 horsepower. That suggests there will be two models, one with 360 and another one with a better tune.\n\nSpearheaded by the all-new 2017 R8, Audi will launch an entire line of performance cars under the RS badge. These will include replacements for the RS5 and TT RS, new body styles and even an SUV. Figuring out which seven RS models will be introduced is tricky unless we include the RS6/7 Performance. With money tight, Audi could be forced to scale back its performance lineup, but for now, their conviction is contagious.\n\nPlay Video", "Discreet, understated, quiet.

The company's Sensus touchscreen infotainment system in the Volvo XC90, S90, and V90 will now offer a built-in interface for the Spotify streaming-music service.Spotify is already available in Volvos and many other vehicles through Bluetooth streaming or via Apple CarPlay integration, and several automakers have apps allowing the Spotify smartphone app to connect with the in-car infotainment system. But Volvo's update is unique in that Spotify is integrated directly into the infotainment system, meaning it will work even without a paired smartphone, so long as the infotainment system itself has an internet connection. Volvo says its in-car interface will be very similar to that of other Spotify apps, and that Spotify will be available in Volvos in any country where the music service exists. The system will also have a feature called Spotify Connect, allowing any passenger in the car to control the music playlist. Users must have a paid Spotify Premium account to use the function. Volvo says that using the built-in Spotify function will allow even greater music fidelity through the cars' optional Bowers & Wilkins surround-sound system.Other cars with some form of Spotify integration include Ford Sync 3, Tesla, BMW and Mini, and any Android Auto- or Apple CarPlay-compatible infotainment system.\"Anyone that has used Spotify knows how great it is -- you have access to your favorite music, all the time,\" Volvo Cars senior vice president of marketing Bj\u00f6rn Annwall said in a statement. \"You can still play music from your Spotify smartphone app in your car, or you can use the in-car app, which will contain all of your favorite playlists, artists and albums.\"", "US auto safety regulators are examining whether an additional 70 million to 90 million Takata Corp airbag inflators should be recalled because they may endanger drivers, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThat would nearly quadruple the 29 million inflators recalled so far and linked to nine deaths in the US.\n\nIn all, as many as 120 million Takata inflators in US vehicles contain the same volatile chemical - ammonium nitrate - used in inflators that automakers have recalled, according to company documents reviewed by Reuters and verified by two former Takata managers. The total number has not been previously reported.\n\nThe Japanese supplier, one of the world's largest airbag manufacturers, has said some inflators can rupture and explode with excessive force, spraying metal shards at vehicle occupants.\n\nThe number of vehicles affected remains unclear because many have more than one inflator, and not always from the same manufacturer. Before recent recalls of 5.4 million inflators, federal regulators said about 24 million defective Takata inflators were used in about 19 million vehicles that have been recalled since 2004.\n\nThe former managers described \"chronic\" quality failures at Takata's North American inflator plants, an assessment reflected in dozens of company emails and documents dating back to 2001. Those problems, the former managers said, make it difficult for the company and regulators to pinpoint which inflators - among tens of millions - pose a danger.\n\n\"You have no way of knowing,\" said one of the former Takata managers, who has direct knowledge of the company's history of manufacturing problems.\n\nThe former Takata managers, who still work in the industry, spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTakata declined to comment when asked about the possibility of massive additional recalls and whether another 70 million to 90 million inflators still in vehicles could endanger drivers. A torrent of new recalls could cost the company billions of dollars and add years to the replacement process.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it is \"cooperating fully with regulators and our automotive customers and continues to take aggressive action to advance vehicle safety.\"\n\nTakata cited its agreement with regulators in November to pay a $70 million penalty to NHTSA in a settlement that included its commitment to stop making inflators that use ammonium nitrate by 2018. It also pledged to declare all remaining ammonium nitrate inflators defective by 2019 unless it can demonstrate they are safe.\n\nThe National Highway Transportation Safety Administration continues to investigate all Takata inflators using ammonium nitrate, but it has not yet found sufficient evidence to direct automakers to recall the remaining inflators, said spokesman Gordon Trowbridge.\n\n\"This issue will take years to resolve,\" Trowbridge said.\n\nMANUFACTURING FAILURES\n\nTakata produced between 260 million and 285 million ammonium nitrate-based inflators worldwide between 2000 and 2015, of which nearly half wound up in US vehicles, one of the former Takata managers told Reuters, citing the company's production records.\n\nTakata supplied those inflators to more than a dozen automakers, according to company documents reviewed by Reuters. Its single largest client was Honda Motor Co, which still owns a minority stake in Takata and has recalled more than 8 million defective Takata inflators in the US.\n\nTakata produced most of the inflators that regulators are now investigating at its main inflator plant in Monclova, Mexico or at plants in Georgia and Washington state, according to company documents. The documents noted persistent quality failures at those plants, which a former Takata official said contributed to inflator ruptures.\n\nLast month, Takata told NHTSA in a filing that \"manufacturing variability\" may have contributed to the ruptures.\n\nThe manufacturing problems are detailed in dozens of internal Takata emails, spreadsheets and presentations reviewed by Reuters. The records show the problems are more pervasive and continued for a longer period than those previously reported. They extended beyond the Mexican plant to the factories in Georgia and Washington state, and they continued until at least 2014, company records show.\n\nAmong the issues: metal shavings inside some inflator parts; improperly welded inflator casings; bad propellant wafers, and bent or damaged parts.\n\nThose problems eventually could allow moisture to contaminate the ammonium nitrate propellant, which in turn could lead to an inflator rupture, one of the former Takata managers told Reuters.\n\nA 2006 internal log of quality issues noted problems with inflators sold to Mazda Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, and Toyota Motor Corp. The log listed problems including metal shavings and contamination, broken or missing clips, and deformed or misaligned parts.\n\nIn a 2010 memo, a Takata manager expressed concern about \"how to control moisture\" in some inflators and worried that the company would not be able to assure the safety of the devices.\n\nIn an email the same year about pre-production quality testing of inflators built at the Monclova factory, a Takata manager expressed confusion to colleague about the causes of pervasive defects.\n\n\"I do not understand why we are failing every lot,\" he wrote.\n\nIn company documents, Takata engineers referred to the failures - when exploding inflators ruptured into metal fragments - as \"ED,\" for \"energetic disassembly.\"\n\nRECALL TRIAGE\n\nThe long-running scandal has overwhelmed the company's ability to furnish replacement parts as fast as automakers are forced to recall vehicles. A Takata competitor, airbag supplier Autoliv Inc, is also making replacements for recalled Takata inflators and recently told investors it expects to continue making those parts through 2017, one year longer than originally planned. More recalls would add more delays.\n\nRegulators have so far tried to direct replacement inflators to older vehicles that were operated in hot, humid parts of the country, because ammonium nitrate becomes unstable when contaminated by moisture and can cause the inflators to rupture.\n\nNHTSA officials have said the agency prioritizes recalls for the inflators it believes are most dangerous because the company has limited capacity to replace them. Customers often wait months to get the vehicles fixed after a recall notice.\n\nThe inflators already recalled are considered among the most dangerous because they do not contain a drying agent, NHTSA officials have said. All nine US deaths linked to Takata airbag failures so far have involved those highest risk airbags, according to NHTSA records.\n\nTakata chief executive Shigehisa Takada last year apologized to victims and claimed responsibility for the dangerous defects.\n\nThe most recent death report came on December 22, when Joel Knight, 52, drove his 2006 Ford Ranger pickup into a cow on a rural road near his home in Kershaw, South Carolina. He died after shrapnel from a ruptured airbag inflator pierced his neck, the family's attorney wrote in a filing with NHTSA.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, Takata confirmed the inflator ruptured in the crash and that it was made in Monclova in 2005, but the company did not specifically link the failure to Knight's death.\n\nShortly after the crash, the company declared 5.4 million more inflators defective. - Reuters", "Already a subscriber, but don't have a login?\n\nActivate your digital access.\n\nLast year, identity thieves stole my cousin's tax refund. How can I keep that from happening to me?\n\nThieves only need your name and Social Security number to file a false tax return in your name and get your refund. It's so easy, the IRS pays out billions of dollars to thieves every year. Your safest option is to file your tax return as early as possible before they can file a fake one.\n\nASBURY PARK PRESS\n\nWATCH: 7 tips first-time tax filers must know\n\nI heard something on your national radio show about a smart fridge. What's that?\n\nSeveral manufacturers were showing off smart refrigerators at this year's Consumer Electronics Show. LG's model included SmartDiagnosis to help LG's techs pinpoint and fix any problems. Samsung's Family Hub fridge has inside cameras so you can remotely check what food you're out of.\n\nI'm thinking of buying a gun and my wife wants it to be a \"smart\" gun. Are there any good ones?\n\nMost smart guns, such as the Armatix iP1, haven't done well on the market because they're a lot more expensive than non-smart models. There's also concern about whether they'll work correctly in high-stress situations. You might be better off with a smart gun lock or smart safe.\n\nASBURY PARK PRESS\n\nLETTER: Smart guns won't thwart criminals, terrorists\n\nI'm looking for a new family car and I'd like it to have a Wi-Fi hotspot for everyone's gadgets. What are my options?\n\nThe 2016 BMW 7 Series is going to feature BMW Car Hotspot that can support up to eight gadgets. You will need to pay for a cellular data plan, however. You can also find something similar on GM cars like the Corvette, Volt and Impala. These use OnStar 4G for Internet access.\n\nI'm training as a paralegal and a colleague joked that soon we'll be replaced by robots. Is that possible?\n\nSome law offices are employing so-called \"e-discovery software\" that uses artificial intelligence to find and analyze documents at lightning speeds. It can even find concepts relevant to a case, not just specific words. So, yes, you could have some tech-based competition in the future.\n\nI'd like the convenience of filing my taxes electronically, but isn't it expensive?\n\nIf you make less than $62,000 a year, you can file your federal tax return for free.

Rob Griffin sees how to share in the spoils\n\nIt's been a great few months for gold. With widespread fears about the global economy fuelling enthusiasm for what is seen as a \"safe haven\" asset, its price has rocketed 20 per cent - from $1,049 an ounce last December to more than $1,250 now, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nThis remarkable bounce has caught everyone by surprise and led to investors reappraising their attitude to both direct holdings in the precious metal and the funds that buy into goldminers, according to Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at the spread-betting firm IG.\n\n'The long-term downtrend in gold was the established fact in financial markets on the assumption that interest rates would rise and global economic improvements would continue making it less relevant,\" he said. \"That has been rudely interrupted as gold has raced away.'\n\nMr Beauchamp believes there are a number of reasons for gold's surge, pointing out that the weakening of the dollar has helped boost the precious metal's reputation as a safe haven during periods of financial uncertainty.\n\n\"Investors always increase allocations to gold when they fear for the global outlook and this then takes on a momentum of its own, with strong inflows into exchange-traded funds [ETFs] and goldmining companies from people trying to play the rise,\" he explained.\n\nBusiness news in pictures 50 show all Business news in pictures 1/50 United goin down\n\nManchester United's absence from the Champions League hurt more than the fans' pride last year - it also dented the bottom line.

Investor enthusiasm for the metal has risen 8.57 per cent over the past month, according to the Lloyds Bank Investor Sentiment Index - at a time when the desire for equities has fallen 6.88 per cent to its lowest level since the index began in March 2013.\n\nThis means that gold has overtaken UK equities in 2016 as the second-most favoured asset class in Britain behind property, said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer at Lloyds Bank Private Banking. \"Both the understanding of risk and the appetite for it have changed,\" he explained. \"Investors seem to be adopting an increasingly negative attitude, even towards lower- risk assets such as government bonds. This shows the current levels of uncertainty among investors.\"\n\nThere are a number of ways to gain exposure to the precious metal - including holding actual gold, buying into ETFs and investing in companies that are involved in goldmining, according to Justin Modray, founder of Candid Financial Advice.\n\n'An ETF that tracks the gold price - such as the ETFS Physical Gold fund, costing 0.39 per cent a year - is one of the simplest and cheapest ways,\" he said. \"You'll need to buy via a stockbroker or investment platform, which will charge dealing fees, but it's still likely to be cost-effective.\"\n\nAlthough buying gold coins or bars is an option, Mr Modray points out that this can be inefficient unless the pieces are very large, because manufacturing costs and mark-ups by gold dealers can easily erode margins. In addition, you will need somewhere safe to store the gold.\n\n\"You can buy shares in mining companies but this adds an extra layer of risk as they might have operational issues and their share price movements tend to exacerbate movements in the gold price,' he added. 'This is good news when the price rises but less so when it falls.'\n\nBrian Dennehy, managing director of FundExpert, argued that investors could generate bigger returns through putting their money into a fund that buys into goldminers.\n\n\"The share prices of gold companies can be highly geared to the gold price,\" he said. \"When gold bounced 6.3 per cent between 22 July and 21 August 2015, the Smith & Williamson Global Gold & Resources fund returned 11.5 per cent over the same period.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Dennehy urged caution.\n\n\"Don't believe any of the silly myths about gold being insurance or an inflation hedge,' he argued. 'It is high risk and only for the fleet of foot over a relatively short period. If that suits you, buy the Smith & Williamson fund - but as a maximum of 10 per cent of your portfolio.'\n\nAlistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, is optimistic about the gold price over the coming months.\n\nHe believes a combination of official purchases, strength in the Asian markets and continuing momentum in the US and Europe has reinforced gold's credentials as a diversification tool for portfolios, a wealth preserver and a hedge against a range of risks.\n\n\"Physical demand will be supported by strong central bank purchases and the continued buying of jewellery, bars and coins by households across the world,\" he said. \"The investment case for gold is as strong as ever.

(Compiled by Brussels newsroom)", "Attendance figures at the industry's biggest trade show in Barcelona next week could hit six figures\n\nMobile World Congress (MWC) 2016 attendee numbers could hit 100,000 for the first time in its 21-year history as the industry's biggest trade show continues to grow apace.\n\nThat would mean numbers will have doubled from the 51,000 that streamed through its doors 11 years after ago when it moved to Barcelona from Cannes.\n\nThe four-day event officially kicks off today (February 22) but the trend of handset manufacturers taking the wraps off their new devices early continued yesterday, with Samsung, Huawei and LG all making major announcements.\n\nFor the fourth year running MWC is taking place at the Fira Gran Via, one of the largest conferencing venues in Europe, measuring 240,000 square metres across eight exhibition halls.\n\nLast year saw 94,000 visitors from 200 countries attend the show, with some 2,200 companies exhibiting and 3,800 members of the international press and media covering it. All figures are expected to rise marginally this week.\n\nMobile Is Everything\n\nThis year's theme is 'Mobile Is Everything', with showcases covering a wide range of topics including the latest handset and wearable releases, the progress of 4G, future 5G innovations, Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile/online security.\n\nThe top ten exhibitors will be: Alcatel, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, Sony, VM Ware and ZTE. This year will also see the return of Google to the exhibitor floor within the App Planet Stand in Hall 8.1, having been absent from the show in terms of stand presence for the past few years.\n\nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg returns for the third successive year. His keynote speech, which will take place at 18:00CET today (February 22) in a sell out auditorium in Hall 4, will see Zuckerberg discuss Facebook's continued work on connecting the people of Africa to the internet.\n\nOther keynote speakers include BT Group CEO Gavin Patterson, Ericsson president and CEO Hans Vestberg, Ford Motor Company president and CEO Mark Fields, GSMA chairman Jon Fredrik Baksaas, Huawei deputy chairman and rotating CEO Guo Ping, Telef\u00f3nica executive chairman and CEO Cesar Alierta and Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao.\n\nBiggest ever\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Mobile News prior to MWC, GSMA chief marketing officer Michael O'Hara said: \"The official statement we have out is that we are expecting 95,000+ attendees but having tracked registration rates from way in advance, we are hopeful this will get to six figures.\n\n\"Whatever happens, this will be our biggest event ever. What we always try to do is to bring together leading CEOs from our industry and adjacent industries to meet and do real business. As long as we keep providing an environment for that to happen, then that certainly bodes well for the future.\"\n\nIn light of the recent terror attacks, particularly following the one in Paris on November 13, security is being significantly increased this year to ensure the tens of thousands of employees are as safe as possible at Mobile World Congress.\n\nThere will be increased police presence, both outside the venue and towards the main entrances, with visitor passports being scanned for the first time when attendees collect their passes for the event. Spot checks will also be carried out.\n\nLast November, the GSMA postponed the annual Mobile 360 conference in Brussels due to ongoing security concerns in the Belgian city, which at the time saw threat levels at their highest.\n\nSafety first\n\nHowever, O'Hara claimed the number of registrations it received for MWC indicated people hadn't been put off from attending and that the GSMA and Spanish authorities have received no information to suggest there will be any major problems.\n\n\"We never saw any concerns - the number of registrations from very early on didn't reflect that at all,\" he said. \"We feel confident that people are definitely attending and there was never any talks around postponing or cancelling MWC.\n\n\"The situation in Brussels was quite serious at the time [of the GSMA] - the city was in lockdown and we had to make that decision. We are continuing to work closely with the police in Catalonia and Spain as a whole. We have a daily dialogue with them and would make decisions as appropriate if anything came to light.\n\n\"We have a peak period on Monday morning when we are trying to get 30,000 people through the doors as quickly as possible. We will do that as efficiently as we can while doing our best to ensure the safety of the event.\"", "The buoyant mobile advertising sector has been dealt a hammer blow with the news that Hutchison Whompoa-owned Three has struck a deal with ad blocking company Shine Technologies with a view to rolling it out across the mobile operator's European operations.\n\nThe deal announced on Friday will see Three's UK and Italian operations implement the technology which differs from other ad blocking technologies by preventing ads from being served to mobile users by blocking ads across cellular networks, with a view to implementing the technology further.\n\nThe implementation of the technology means that Three will be able rapidly roll-out the technology to all other Three Group operators in Europe, which also includes Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden (Hong Kong-based Hutchison has 87 million subscribers globally).\n\nIn a statement announcing the deal, Three claimed it did not want to eliminate mobile advertising, rather it wanted to \"give customers more control, choice and greater transparency over what they receive.\"\n\nTom Malleschitz, Three UK, CMO, added: \"Irrelevant and excessive mobile ads annoy customers and affect their overall network experience. We don't believe customers should have to pay for data usage driven by mobile ads. The industry has to work together to give customers mobile ads they want and benefit from.\"\n\nThree claims that in the next few months it will work with Shine to \"deliver a better, more targeted and more transparent mobile ad experience to customers\", but operations are not yet clear.\n\nWith 8.8 million subscribers Three ranks as the smallest UK operator brand to hold a telecoms licence, but its parent company Hutchison is in agreement to by O2's operations there from Telefonica, although this deal is subject to regulatory approval, in a deal that would be worth in excesss of \u00a310.25bn.\n\nOne potential business model for Three to explore includes a potential revenue share deal with the mobile advertising sector's major names, such as Google and Facebook. A key point raised by the mobile operator in the announcement reads: \"customers should not pay data charges to receive adverts. These should be costs borne by the advertiser.\"\n\nThe deal between Shine and Three also reflects the resurging influence of mobile operators in the digital advertising game - a marked trend in 2015, after many had written them off as serious contenders in adland.\n\nOne business case for telcos to pair with ad blockers is to use the prospect of a full implementation as a means of encouraging Google et al to volunteer some degree of revenue-share in exchange for ferrying this traffic.\n\nCiaran O'Kane, a thought leader in the digital advertising space, and CEO of research and analysis firm ExchangeWire, said: \"This is a great result for Three and Shine, as they both have now found a way to monetise Three's mobile domain outside of its rapidly declining voice and data business. They finally have their mobile toll business, where users are used as proxy for profit.\"\n\nIt does, however, raise issues around net neutrality (a protocol where telcos have to treat all traffic on their network equally) and is likely to be a key area of debate at this year's Mobile World Congress.", "Mobile World Congress 2016 is shaping up to be the biggest yet with close to 100,000 mobile telecoms professionals congregating in Barcelona. Among them will be 26 cutting edge Irish tech players.\n\nAmong the 26 companies will be 18 tech firms that will be on the Enterprise Ireland pavilion, including five new start-up companies.\n\n\"These companies are already attracting the attention of major international players and the Mobile World Congress (MWC) will provide them the perfect platform to demonstrate these solutions and to strengthen their ties with mobile operators and other key players in the global telecoms ecosystem,\" explained John McNamara, manager of Enterprise Ireland's software division.\n\nSo in no particular order, here's the best of the Irish at Mobile World Congress 2016.\n\n1.

Brite:Bill\n\nBrite:Bill's head of marketing Orla Power at Mobile World Congress 2015\n\nBrite:Bill believes its approach to customer-centric billing and communications for operators is transforming the telecoms billing landscape for both service providers and users. Having landed multi-million-dollar deals with tier-one operators such as Vodafone, Sprint and T-Mobile, the telecoms world apparently thinks so too.\n\nBrite:Bill leaders Alan Coleman (co-founder and CEO) and Jim Hannon (co-founder and CTO) will be attending MWC with the team to share a new product announcement, as well as analysis and industry insight.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive officer of Facebook Inc., arrives on stage for a keynote session at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, March 2, 2015. Two years ago, Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the Mobile World Congress, an annual industry gathering held in Barcelona, to reassure phone companies that Facebook is their natural ally. He'd just announced the $22 billion purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service and was touting an initiative called Internet.org, a low-bandwidth suite of basic services carriers would offer in conjunction with Facebook to get hundreds of millions of people online for the first time. He pledged to \"build what is going to be a more profitable model with more subscribers for carriers.\" By sticking together, the Facebook founder said, both sides could benefit handsomely.\n\nAs Zuckerberg prepares to return to Barcelona for this year's MWC on Feb. 22, phone executives say his company looks more like a competitor than a partner. Last year, WhatsApp introduced free voice calls -- something Facebook already offered -- and both brands have messaging apps. These so-called over-the-top services cut into mobile carriers' voice and texting revenue because they're offered over the Internet. Some phone companies say Facebook and its ilk are freeloaders that rely on carriers' network infrastructure without spending any money to support it. \"WhatsApp is competing with us, not only with messaging but with voice, too,\" Telef\u00f3nica Chief Operating Officer Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez-Pallete said in August at a telecommunications industry event in the Spanish coastal city of Santander. \"The premise should be, same services, same rules.\"\n\nTelef\u00f3nica has huge operations in Latin America. And it's in emerging markets where the tension with the messaging apps is most evident. Carriers there are more dependent on revenue from voice and text (in developed countries, data is the bigger moneymaker). A Brazilian judge in December ordered WhatsApp to suspend service in the country following a complaint from a telecommunications lobbying group, though the decision was soon overruled by another court. Since October, Egypt has shut down several Internet calling apps. India's telecom regulator this month barred operators from giving discounts for access to specific websites. A direct challenge to Zuckerberg's Internet.org plans, the Indian ruling effectively ended Facebook's partnership with Reliance Communications, which had offered free access to the site and 30 others in some data plans.\n\nIn South Africa, carriers MTN Group and Vodacom Group contend that services such as WhatsApp, Skype, Google Hangouts, and the Viber messaging app cost the country billions of rand in tax revenue and compromise security because their encryption makes it easier for criminals to avoid government surveillance. South Africa's telecom regulator has begun an investigation into the impact of over-the-top services, and Nigeria is considering regulating them. \"Technology has outpaced current consumer legislation in many countries,\" says Lisa Felton, who oversees regulatory issues for Vodafone, the controlling shareholder of Vodacom.\n\nWhatsApp doesn't provide data on voice calls, but it claims 1 billion users, roughly double the number it had when Facebook bought the company. And Skype says it carries in excess of 2 billion minutes of calls per day. In Eastern Europe, where such apps are growing in popularity for national and international calls, mobile carriers' voice revenue has dropped by a third over the past five years, a decline that hasn't been fully offset by rising data usage, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Erhan Gurses. Facebook declined to comment.\n\nNot all carriers are lining up against Facebook. The company has more than a dozen partnerships with phone companies from Paraguay to the Philippines. Many of them say teaming up with Facebook is beneficial, because it boosts data usage and has the potential to increase revenue. Millicom International Cellular, a carrier with more than 63 million subscribers in Africa and Latin America, has run promotions in certain markets where it offers free access to Facebook and Internet.org for a couple of months. The company reported last year that 33 percent of subscribers who take part end up upgrading to fee-paying data plans. Similarly, South Africa's No. 3 mobile company, Cell C, offers Facebook and WhatsApp for free in certain subscription packages, because they draw new users. \"If we don't innovate around these services and drive value to our customers, we run a higher risk of being left out of the future entirely,\" said Cell C Chief Executive Officer Jos\u00e9 Dos Santos in an e-mail.\n\nIn the long run, say some industry analysts, WhatsApp and other alternatives shouldn't be seen as a threat to the voice service of phone companies. The typically superior sound quality of the voice calls in the apps uses lots of data. \"If carriers price their data offerings correctly, it could drive up revenues,\" says John Delaney, an analyst at researcher IDC. And when people graduate to video apps like Skype, data consumption grows exponentially. Says Delaney, \"What carriers resent is investing heavily and having others piggyback on their investments.\"\n\nThe bottom line: Telcos in emerging markets complain Facebook and WhatsApp are siphoning off precious text and voice revenue.", "\u00a9 Bloomberg Samsung Electronics Co. Gear S2 wearable devices are displayed during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2016. The day the physical SIM card disappears is slowly getting closer. Last year, we heard that Samsung, Apple, and various mobile carriers were working to create a new standard for embedded or eSIMs (programmable SIMs that allow you to switch carriers without swapping the physical card in your device). Now, the GSMA has announced a new eSIM specification for smartwatches, fitness trackers, and tablets, with Samsung's Gear S2 Classic 3G the first device on the market to come equipped with the new technology.\n\nNow, a few caveats are needed. This isn't the first mobile device to offer a programmable SIM card (certain iPads have this functionality using Apple's own tech, for example). Nor does the standard apply to smartphones, with the GSMA saying that won't be coming until June. However, this is still a big step forward for the eSIM, with the new specification backed by some of world's largest hardware manufacturers (including Samsung, LG, Microsoft, and Huawei) and mobile carriers (including AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telef\u00f3nica, and EE).\n\nApple is reportedly involved in developing the eSIM too\n\nMissing from this public lineup of partners is Apple. The company has gone its own way by creating the programmable Apple SIM, but is reportedly involved in the GSMA's development of the eSIM. Last year, the GSMA told The Financial Times that the association would continue \"to work with Apple to secure their support for the initiative,\" before adding: \"We are optimistic, a formal agreement with them is still in progress.\"\n\nNevertheless, the GSMA is pretty excited about the news. \"This is the only common, interoperable and global specification that has the backing of the mobile industry and lets consumers with a mobile subscription remotely connect their devices to a mobile network,\" said the association's chief technology officer, Alex Sinclair, in a press release. \"This new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices.\"\n\nThe Samsung Gear S2 Classic 3G will be available from March, but we'll see more fruits of the GSMA's work later this year when the eSIM specification for smartphones is announced."], "2016-02-22": ["HSBC's latest results weren't pretty - and that's just the numbers\n\nHow does all the loud applause and talk about HSBC's decision to stay put in London being a vote of confidence in the capital look now, after this latest set of results?\n\nThey weren't pretty, and that's just the numbers, which Investec's ever-readable Ian Gordon described as \"disappointingly weak\" and \"a miss\".\n\nOf considerably more concern, however, should be the bank's regulatory issues.\n\nI've often lampooned chief executive Stuart Gulliver in this column for the way he goes into something resembling religious ecstasy at the mere mention of China's Pearl River Delta, but the bank has established formidable positions in businesses across Asia.\n\nWhat is now coming into focus is the means it has used to establish some of those positions.\n\nHidden away on page 454 of the 502-page opus of its report and accounts is the bank's disclosure of an investigation by America's powerful Securities & Exchange Commission into \"hiring practices of candidates referred by or related to government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in Asia-Pacific\".\n\nPopularly known as \"princelings\", their employment by businesses operating in the region, to nebulous roles with fancy titles and fancier salaries, can serve as a subtle form of corruption.\n\nAt this stage there is no suggestion that HSBC has engaged in that sort of corruption.

HSBC also has a connection to the Fifa scandal, with the US Department of Justice investigating the possible processing of improper transactions.

When the boss gets excited about something, like the Pearl River Delta, or whatever else is the flavour of the month, or just about finding ways of making money when the results don't look good, the people beneath him will do their damndest to make it happen. Unfortunately, that sometimes sees them cutting corners.\n\nThis is what happens when you allow institutions to get too big to effectively manage. Remind me again why London is celebrating being the venue for this?\n\nFavourable climate with a good chance of complaints\n\nOne of the reasons HSBC stayed put was that the \"political and regulatory climate\" in the UK had become more to its liking. And to the banking industry in general.\n\nTaxes have been eased, regulation softened, reviews into things like culture dropped. That should making us deeply uncomfortable and this morning the Financial Ombudsman will provide another demonstration as to why.\n\nThe figures it will release are for complaints against individual firms and they are, as ever, a mixed bag. The most disturbing aspect is that Lloyds, the biggest retail bank in the UK, saw 45,585 complaints going to the ombudsman as a group (including all subsidiaries), nearly as many as Barclays, RBS and HSBC combined. It was the only one of the big four to see a rise (8 per cent) compared with the previous six months.\n\nIt would be easy enough at this point to call for more and tougher regulation to bring the banks into line. Which, of course, isn't going to happen. If it was, HSBC would have set sail for Hong Kong.\n\nThe solution, then, is down to us. If numbers like that, or the stories I've outlined above, appall you then take advantage of the improved account switching service now on offer and move.\n\nIt is true, as I revealed a couple of weeks ago, that the bad-old-days RBS appears on the CVs of the bosses of around half the so called \"challenger banks\". But it isn't hard to avoid them.\n\nCall it DIY regulation.

Telefonica said the goal is to deploy service operation centers in each country in which it operates. These centers will monitor in real time the customer quality of experience and the quality of service to proactively tackle issues.\n\nThe SOC implementations are set to begin before the end of the year in Argentina and Chile, with further expansion planned for Spain and Germany. By the end of 2017, Telefonica said it plans to have rolled out the SOCs across all of its markets.

Last November, C\u00e9sar Alierta, executive chairman of Telefonica, said the telco has defined itself as a company promoting connections in life for people to choose a world of infinite possibilities. Alierta disclosed the strategic plan comprised six key elements: connectivity, integrated offerings, differential experience, big data, end-to-end digitalization and capital allocation/simplification.\n\nThe most recent announcement follows Alierta's statement that Telefonica was going to place the defense of its customers' interests at the center of its stance, which will focus on three concepts: digital trust, open Internet and digital access.\n\nJuan Manuel Caro, Telfonica's global director of operations and operating support systems, explained the big data analytics project will help the telco better understand customer demands and help the carrier to better manage its resources.\n\n\"It changes our view to look at network,\" Caro said, adding with the SOCs, Telefonica will be able to use data to understand trends and act proactive.\n\n\"We knew what to do, but now we will know first if customers are facing issues with the network,\" said Blanco. \"And this is a key factor when see prepare ourselves to the traffic data growth.\"\n\nEditors note: Samsung provided travel costs to MWC\n\nShare on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) big data analytics LATAM Mobile World Congress Telefonica", "Another day, another rumour about consolidation in telecoms - this time involving Vodafone.\n\nSpeculation about potential merger activity in the sector has long done the rounds as mobile operators try to enter the fixed-line and broadband market and vice-versa.\n\nUp until now, most talk surrounding Vodafone has focused on a potential tie-up with Virgin Media owner Liberty Global, particularly after the pair agreed to merge their Dutch businesses last week.\n\nBut the latest whisper is that chief executive Vittorio Colao's charge is attracting fresh interest from the Far East, namely China Telecom (CT), China Mobile and possibly other operators backed by the Chinese government.\n\nMajority state-owned CT is rumoured to have advisers running the rule over Vodafone, which has been expanding in Europe through the Dutch tie-up, its acquisition of Germany's Kabel Deutschland in 2013 and other deals.\n\nVodafone is rumoured to be attracting fresh interest from the Far East, namely China Telecom (CT), China Mobile and possibly other operators backed by the Chinese government\n\nCT is thought to be keen to expand internationally to develop its presence and experience in types of network other than its Chinese operation.\n\nTalk has it that the Chinese would need to bid at least 300p a share to win over Vodafone's shareholders and to fight off other parties thought to be keeping their eye on the situation, such as America's AT&T.\n\nA Vodafone spokesman declined to comment.

KAZINFORM Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei launched a 2-in-1 product that combines the mobility of a smartphone and productivity of a laptop at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona on Sunday, marking the firm's latest step to expand its consumer business.\n\nThe device, called the Huawei MateBook, retails from 799 euros in the European market and 699 U.S. dollars in the U.S. market. It will be made available across international markets from April onwards through both retail and e-commerce channels.\n\nThe core device of the MateBook is a tablet with a detachable keyboard much like Apple'siPad Pro, and runs Microsoft's latest operating system Windows 10.\n\nIt weighs 640 grams, compared to 713 grams for Apple's iPad Pro and the 766 grams of Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, both of which are portable tablets known for their lightweight design. It has a 12-inch screen.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook has a high-density lithium battery, which lasts for 10 hours once fully charged. The product features a sixth generation Intel Core m-series processor aimed at handling the most rigorous business demands.\n\nBuilt to operate on Windows 10, the MateBook also delivers tools and features offered by Microsoft Corp, including its latest browser, Microsoft Edge, and the Cortana digital personal assistant.\n\n\"We have decided to launch this product to answer the needs of business users. What makes our MateBook unique are are its compatibility and huge variety of functions,\" said Glory Zhang, chief marketing officer of Huawei Consumer Business.\n\nAlthough MateBook is being launched later than other comparable tablets, Zhang said it is no cause for concern because Huawei's strategy is to bring to market products once the technology involved can best satisfy consumer needs.\n\n\"We are not so concerned about being the first in a market. For example, when we launched our smartphone, the market was already filled with many smartphone makers, but our high quality allowed us to win market share.\"\n\n\"We have made good use of cutting edge technologies that we developed for our smartphone in our MateBook, which gives us a competitive strength,\" Zhang says.\n\nHuawei, founded in Shenzhen in 1987, has three core business areas. Its carrier business provides telecommunications services to operators like O2 and Telefonica, and it provides telecommunications services to corporate clients. Its third business area is consumer products.\n\nIn recent years its consumer business has picked up and has become a key factor in helping build the firm's brand across international markets. Its core products include the Huawei smartphone and Huawei Watch.\n\nHuawei is now the third-biggest player in the smartphone market after Apple and Samsung, and shipped 108 million smartphones in 2015, which represents a 44 percent increase in sales compared to 2014.\n\nNow Huawei is looking to make a major play in the tablet sector. Globally, tablet shipments fell 13.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2015, while shipments for detachable tablets reached an all-time high of 8.1 million devices, more than double from the same period in 2014, according to the research firm International Data Corporation.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook is being launched alongside the MatePen, which is used to write and draw on the MateBook. It has high sensitivity, can support graphics and mathematic functions and can be used as a laser pointer for delivering presentations.\n\nThe MateBook also has a one-touch unlocking system, which Huawei says is the fastest fingerprint recognition technology in the industry. Its technology supports 360 degrees sensitive identification, which leads to fewer identification failures than competitor technology.", "Every smartphone has a tiny plastic SIM card, which connects the device to a carrier's network. SIMs can be a hassle to change and they are currently carrier specific. Now, the SIM card is finally making way for a more convenient standard, and Samsung is leading the charge. Its 3G-enabled Gear S2 Classic smartwatch is the first device to sport an electronic SIM card, or eSIM.\n\nWhat's an eSIM, exactly? It's not something you'll ever see, and that's the point. It's the internal equivalent of the familiar, rectangular widgets that slot into most modern-day smartphones. It's essentially a tiny SIM card embedded within the device itself, but unlike the carrier-specific SIM cards you're used to swapping from your smartphone, it's much more capable. It's programmable, so you can theoretically switch between carriers in the settings menu of your phone or smartwatch. Thanks to a design that dispenses with a slide-out tray, it's up to 90 percent smaller than a traditional SIM card, according to GSMA Chief Engineer Ian Pannell in an interview with the Verge.\n\nRelated: Embedded SIM cards will let you switch carriers on the fly, and carriers are supporting it in droves\n\nIt's also got the backing of big hitters in the mobile industry. The GSMA, the standards body that's currently in the process of certifying eSIM, counts electronics behemoths Samsung, Microsoft, LG, Huawei, and others among its members. Just as importantly, a diverse lineup of carriers have already pledged to support the new standard, including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom (the parent company of T-Mobile), Etisalat, Hutchinson Whampoa (the parent company of Three), Orange, Telef\u00f3nica (the parent company of O2), Vodafone, and EE).\n\n\"This is the only common, interoperable and global specification that has the backing of the mobile industry and lets consumer with a mobile subscription remotely connect their devices to a mobile network,\" said GSMA Chief Technology Officer Alex Sinclair in a statement. \"The new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices\"\n\nRelated: Apple's new iPads let you switch LTE networks without changing your SIM card\n\nA glaring absence from that list of full partners, you might notice, is Apple, but the association says that the company's made contributions to the new standard. \"[We are] continuing to work with Apple to secure their support for the initiative,\" a spokesperson told The Financial Times in July of last year. Apple's reticence isn't surprising: The company infamously introduced a custom SIM solution, the so-called Apple SIM, with the LTE version of the iPad Air 2. It, like eSIM, was significantly smaller than conventional SIM cards and supported software-based carrier switching.\n\nBut unlike Apple's technology, eSIM will soon make the jump to phones. The standard is set to be approved in June, and Samsung's already promised its future handsets will use eSIMs. The company is launching the Gear S2 Classic 3G as a test of sorts ahead of that broader eSIM rollout.\n\nThe Gear S2 Classic 3G debuts in March. Pricing has yet to be announced.", "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS - CK Hutchison Holdings will seek to convince EU antitrust regulators of the merits of its proposed buy of Telefonica's British mobile unit at a hearing on March 4, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nThe move comes after the European Commission earlier this month warned that the 10.3-billion-pound deal to create Britain's biggest mobile operator may result in higher bills for consumers.\n\nThe combination of Hutchison's Three Mobile and Telefonica's O2 will cut the number of network operators from four to three in Britain, a level which regulators dislike unless companies offer hefty concessions to allay their concerns.\n\nLi Ka-Shing's Hutchison, however, is keen to reinforce its telecoms operations in the UK, the smallest network operator in the country.

Intel expects this number to hit 50 billion by 2020.\n\nTo make this vision a reality, Intel is pushing forward with plans to converge computing and communications and make wireless networks more intelligent, efficient and flexible, claiming that it's the perfect company to do so given that it has fingers in so many pies.\n\nIntel can't do it alone, though, and announced during MWC on Monday that it will collaborate with some of the biggest names in the networking industry, such as Huawei, Nokia and Verizon, on networking technologies and trials to ensure that 5G arrives as soon as possible. The collaboration has already begun in the case of Verizon.\n\nIntel CEO Brian Krzanich said during a separate keynote at MWC on Monday that this could be as early as 2018, sooner than Ofcom's promise of a 2020 rollout.\n\nOther companies involved in the 5G push include AT&T, China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, NTT Docomo, Telef\u00f3nica, Vodafone, ZTE, Ericsson, Korea Telecom and SK Telecom.\n\nIntel claimed that the firm is uniquely positioned to usher in the 5G era with end-to-end solutions that integrate intelligence across the network, from the data centre to the connected device and all systems in between.\n\nAicha Evans, general manager of Intel's Communications and Devices Group, said: \"Communications are not going away, and we believe it's our responsibility as an ecosystem to make the networks ready [for 5G].\n\n\"It's about getting together and making sure we're developing trials and prototypes and taking advantage of major events that are going to present an opportunity to demonstrate the tech.\n\n\"Building on our existing portfolio of wireless products, new modems and SoCs will provide robust connectivity solutions for Internet of Things, mobile devices and PCs toward our path to 5G.\"\n\nIntel has announced new modems and SoCs to ensure the early prototyping of 5G, including five solutions aimed squarely at IoT devices such as connected cars and wearables, and the Intel XMM 7480 for mobile devices and PCs.\n\nThis LTE-A modem reduces development cost, complexity and time to market, according to Intel, supporting 33 LTE bands and download speeds of up to 450Mbps, and boasting up to 15 percent less power consumption than the XMM 7360.", "BARCELONA: The chief executive of Vodafone underlined the benefits of the company's plan to work with Liberty Global in the Netherlands, an arrangement being closely watched by analysts and investors who hope the two firms will one day reach a wider deal.\n\nVodafone was in talks last year with John Malone's Liberty about asset swaps or other tie-ups in Europe, which potentially would have enabled allow both to offer a richer package of TV, broadband and mobile in countries like Britain and Germany.\n\nThose talks collapsed, but a more limited joint venture in the Netherlands was agreed earlier this month.\n\n\"If we work well with Liberty of course it's much better than if we don't, and if we get used to our own different cultures, it is of course an enrichment and a positive,\" Vittorio Colao told journalists at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona on Monday.\n\nHe said, however, that every country and every situation had to be looked at on its own merits.\n\nAnalyst Sam Dhillon at RBC Capital Markets said on Monday that Vodafone and Liberty Global should extend the joint venture model to Britain.\n\nBut he said a deal would only come after a review of BT's fixed-line infrastructure arm Openreach is completed - findings are due on Thursday - and European regulators rule on Hutchison's purchase of Telefonica's O2.\n\nIn the case of BT, Colao said he wanted the regulator to either recommend that the company should be split up, or instead, impose much tighter obligations on Openreach in terms of performance and price.\n\nVodafone recently launched fixed-line broadband using Openreach's network.\n\n\"We are getting a decent amount of customers each month, and when we are ready we will launch our own content-rich TV offer,\" Colao said, but he added the company had not yet struck the content deals it wanted.\n\n\"For the time being we have not reached an agreement with BT,\" he said.", "This week Intel appeared at MWC 2016 to speak largely about the imminent onset of 5G mobile data.

They're ready to roll right now. Ready to roll for 5G data.\n\nIntel's been ramping up efforts to see their hardware powering devices of all sizes. They've seen the most success in PCs, as you'll be most readily aware, but they've been making strides in smaller devices - like smartphones - over the past few years.\n\nNow as we're entering the 5G era - that is, the next fastest data speed for internet connectivity - Intel is in a position to provide hardware for clients, networks, and cloud partners. Start to finish, so to speak.\n\nThey've partnered with companies like AT&T, China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Huawei, NTT Docomo, Telefonica, Vodafone, ZTE, and most recently Ericsson, Korea Telecom, Nokia, SK Telecom, and Verizon.\n\nIntel is \"investing in early prototypes to be a time to market leader tomorrow.\" Intel suggests that they'll be adding to their already existing portfolio of wireless products with new modems and SoCs to \"provide robust connectivity solutions for Internet of Things, mobile devices, and PCs\" toward their path to the onset of 5G.\n\nAs such, Intel has revealed a number of new 5G-ready hardware products.\n\nAs you'll see above, these products will be distributed amongst devices that'll exist within the near future at lower speeds (down to 3G), all the way on up to the fastest of speeds for the biggest NB-IOT solutions.\n\nIntel wants to make clear that they'll not only be pushing faster speeds to the public through their hardware, they'll be aiming to command the entire chain of hardware solutions to connect users with 5G.\n\nIntel is also working with groups like IEEE and 3GPP to provide industry and ecosystem leadership -

The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "Colao backs European Commission on Denmark decision, sees no problem with planned Italian merger, but warns of conflicts in U.K.\n\nEuropean telecoms regulators' fears over in-market consolidation bringing higher prices for consumers are misplaced, Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao insisted on Monday.\n\n\"The concern on pricing is overblown,\" he said, speaking to the media on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress.\n\nWhen looking at the potential impact of a merger deal, regulatory authorities should recognise that price is not the same as consumer spend, Colao said. In many cases, consumers are spending around 3%-5% more in return for 60%-70% growth in usage, he explained, while in others Vodafone wishes it could reach that 3%-5% mark.\n\n\"To me, it looks like an excellent deal,\" he said. \"We should look at the overall customer deal,\" rather than headline prices.\n\nThe desire to mitigate the impact on the consumer wallet is usually the main focus of national competition regulators and the European Commission when it comes to deciding the fate of proposed M&A deals.\n\nFive months ago European competition commissioner nixed Telenor and TeliaSonera's plans to merge in Denmark with a view to preventing a reduction in competition and the imposition of higher prices on consumers.\n\nAustria is often cited as a market in which prices have risen following the 2013 acquisition of Orange's local unit by Hong Kong's Hutchison.\n\nNot so, Colao believes. \"[Prices are] going down everywhere, including Austria,\" he said.\n\nNonetheless, Colao has few complaints about the European Commission's track record when it comes to mergers.\n\n\"I don't think the Commission has been too aggressive with its stance,\" he said.\n\n\"In Denmark there was a certain market structure,\" that gave the Commission cause for concern, he said. \"In Italy it's a different case.\"\n\nHutchison Europe and Vimpelcom formally notified the European Commission of their intention to merge their Italian fixed and mobile businesses, Wind and 3 Italia respectively, earlier this month. Colao believes the deal will get the green light from Brussels.\n\n\"I don't see problems,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he is less enthusiastic about the proposed merger between Hutchison's U.K. business, 3UK, with Telefonica's O2, largely because the two mobile operators are involved in separate network-sharing deals.\n\n\"[That] conflicts with competition law,\" Colao said. \"O2 and Hutch cannot pretend to sit on two different, exclusive,\" network partnerships.", "Vivendi chairman Vincent Bollore gave a hint of some big plays coming down the pipelines with the confirmation that its pay TV division Canal Plus is engaged in talks with Qatari-owned beIN Sports over an exclusive distribution agreement. The move, if approved by anti-trust authorities in France, would give Canal Plus execs a much-needed revenue boost while also giving beIN Sports better carriage in France.\n\nThe two companies had up until this point been fierce rivals. By aggressively snapping up major soccer, tennis and rugby rights from 2012 onwards, beIN had positioned itself as a big rival to the French pay-TV giant, potentially even an existential one, as sliding Canal Plus subscriber numbers were behind an exec cull at the company last summer. Canal Plus chief exec Rodolphe Belmer, chairman Bertrand Meheut and a number of other execs were all shown the door in quick succession. That was largely due to the board's dissatisfaction with their efforts to stem the tide of falling revenues, a situation highlighted by the uncharacteristically blunt Vivendi statement.\n\n\"The six Canal Plus channels have been losing money in France for the last four years,\" said the Vivendi statement. \"Vivendi cannot on a long-term basis continue to finance the losses of Canal Plus channels in France.\"\n\nFor beIN, which has virtually closed its deal to acquire 100% of Miramax from Colony Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority, the Canal Plus move is as much political as it is commercial. The Qatari-owned company, the precursor to Al Jazeera Sports, would not want to be seen as the primary architect in the demise of a French institution such as Canal Plus, particularly at a time when France remains on alert following the tragic terrorist attacks launched in Paris last November by ISIS-affiliated killers, which saw 130 people killed. The role of Gulf states and individuals in aiding and financing, directly or indirectly, extremist groups such as ISIS, has increasingly become a sensitive one.\n\nVivendi has also confirmed it has launched a hostile takeover for French vidgame company Gameloft, founded by France's Guillemot brothers, who also own Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft, another Vivendi target. Vivendi offered 6 Euros per share for Gameloft, repping a 50% premium over the share price when Vivendi started building up its stake in the company last October. As of Monday, Gameloft shares had risen to 6.64 Euros per share, up from its 5.48 Euro closing price prior to news of Vivendi's intention.\n\nVivendi also owns just under 30% of Gameloft. The acquisition move follows a period of Vivendi divesting assets such as telcos SFT and Maroc Telecom, as well as video game publisher Activision Blizzard, to focus on its core media assets Canal + and Universal Music Group. Those moves left Vivendi sitting on a war chest of billions of dollars with which to build the business.\n\nVivendi execs are seriously exploring the viability of launching their own OTT service across Europe, in essence becoming a rival to Netflix. That would be a game-changer if it comes to pass, given the deep pockets, extensive libraries and distribution network Vivendi already boasts. To Vivendi's advantage is the strategic relationships it has now with telcos Telefonica in Spain and Telecom Italia in Italy, in which it now owns a 20.5% stake. Last year, Vivendi divested its Brazilian telco GVT to Telefonica, allowing it to become the leading shareholder in Telecom Italia. The ability to leverage those assets, particularly in terms of offering consumers quad-play services across the UK, France, Germany and now Spain and Italy would give Vivendi a formidable platform with which to take on Netflix, should it choose to move forward with that strategy.\n\nVivendi finalised its acquisition of online video channel Dailymotion last June, with the digital company presenting a ready-made platform on which to expand into OTT delivery.", "MOD Evolves the Android Framework by Democratizing Surface Areas Previously Only Available to OS Creators, Driving New Opportunities for 3rd Party Services and OEMs\n\nBarcelona, Spain, February 22, 2016 /India PRwire/ -- Cyanogen Inc., a global leader in mobile computing, today announced at Mobile World Congress the launch of MOD\u2122, an integrated mobile platform that is going to change the way users, developers, OEMs, and MNOs build and interact with their mobile devices.

(Xinhua)\n\nChinese telecommunications giant Huawei launched a 2-in-1 product that combines the mobility of a smartphone and productivity of a laptop at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona on Sunday, marking the firm's latest step to expand its consumer business.\n\nThe device, called the Huawei MateBook, retails from 799 euros in the European market and 699 U.S. dollars in the U.S. market. It will be made available across international markets from April onwards through both retail and e-commerce channels.\n\nThe core device of the MateBook is a tablet with a detachable keyboard much like Apple's iPad Pro, and runs Microsoft's latest operating system Windows 10.\n\nIt weighs 640 grams, compared to 713 grams for Apple's iPad Pro and the 766 grams of Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, both of which are portable tablets known for their lightweight design. It has a 12-inch screen.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook has a high-density lithium battery, which lasts for 10 hours once fully charged. The product features a sixth generation Intel Core m-series processor aimed at handling the most rigorous business demands.\n\nBuilt to operate on Windows 10, the MateBook also delivers tools and features offered by Microsoft Corp, including its latest browser, Microsoft Edge, and the Cortana digital personal assistant.\n\n\"We have decided to launch this product to answer the needs of business users. What makes our MateBook unique are are its compatibility and huge variety of functions,\" said Glory Zhang, chief marketing officer of Huawei Consumer Business.\n\nAlthough MateBook is being launched later than other comparable tablets, Zhang said it is no cause for concern because Huawei's strategy is to bring to market products once the technology involved can best satisfy consumer needs.\n\n\"We are not so concerned about being the first in a market. For example, when we launched our smartphone, the market was already filled with many smartphone makers, but our high quality allowed us to win market share.\"\n\n\"We have made good use of cutting edge technologies that we developed for our smartphone in our MateBook, which gives us a competitive strength,\" Zhang says.\n\nHuawei, founded in Shenzhen in 1987, has three core business areas. Its carrier business provides telecommunications services to operators like O2 and Telefonica, and it provides telecommunications services to corporate clients. Its third business area is consumer products.\n\nIn recent years its consumer business has picked up and has become a key factor in helping build the firm's brand across international markets. Its core products include the Huawei smartphone and Huawei Watch.\n\nHuawei is now the third-biggest player in the smartphone market after Apple and Samsung, and shipped 108 million smartphones in 2015, which represents a 44 percent increase in sales compared to 2014.\n\nNow Huawei is looking to make a major play in the tablet sector. Globally, tablet shipments fell 13.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2015, while shipments for detachable tablets reached an all-time high of 8.1 million devices, more than double from the same period in 2014, according to the research firm International Data Corporation.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook is being launched alongside the MatePen, which is used to write and draw on the MateBook. It has high sensitivity, can support graphics and mathematic functions and can be used as a laser pointer for delivering presentations.\n\nThe MateBook also has a one-touch unlocking system, which Huawei says is the fastest fingerprint recognition technology in the industry. Its technology supports 360 degrees sensitive identification, which leads to fewer identification failures than competitor technology.\n\nThe keyboard that accompanies MateBook features 1.5 millimeter keystroke and a Chiclet keycap design, which allows for larger key surfaces to minimize typing errors. The built-in touchpad uses multi-touch technology that supports finger movement and effectively combines comfort with function.", "BARCELONA, SPAIN -- (Marketwired) -- 02/22/16 -- Cyanogen Inc., a global leader in mobile computing, today announced at Mobile World Congress the launch of MOD\u0099, an integrated mobile platform that is going to change the way users, developers, OEMs, and MNOs build and interact with their mobile devices.

The group, which includes companies such as Telefonica, Orange, and Vodafone, has clearly emphasised the need for IoT to be secure and protect personal data. This is an excellent set of principles and a very sensible approach.\n\nGlobal standards for IoT will become increasingly important as the role of connected devices increases in our everyday lives. In the space between the advent of this technology and its mass adoption, there is a great opportunity for manufacturers, tech companies, and suppliers to work together to standardise IoT and avoid 'specification wars', rapid obsolescence, security flaws, and ethical issues.\n\nStandardisation is also crucial because of just how many devices IoT could be made up of. With the potential for any object to be made 'smart', there will be an unprecedented number of collectors and transmitters of personal data. The fact that these devices need to talk to each other also means that data could be shared and used by a huge number of different companies.\n\nDespite the guidelines outlined by GSMA, there will still be a significant challenge in securing personal data and ensuring it is not misused, especially in an industry that is largely reliant on the commoditisation of the data these devices collect. The best approach is for the major players within IoT to set an ethical standard. Blackballing companies that don't play by these rules will help to deter misuse. Transparency will also be key. Letting consumers know how their data will be collected and used will help to build trust.\n\nIt will also be crucial to ensure that the security of IoT devices is rigorous. The failure of one popular device to protect personal data from hackers risks undermining trust in the entire industry. That is why it was also welcome that more than 30 firms including Intel, BT, and Vodafone announced last year that they would band together to create an industry body to vet internet connected devices for security flaws.\n\nHowever, GSMA's call for homogeneous data protection legislation across the globe to further drive development and uptake of IoT, is, unfortunately, very much a pipe dream. The contentious nature of data protection laws means that a general consensus is highly unlikely and it will take a significant amount of time for different governments to come to an agreement. One only has to look at the ruckus created over the failure of the Safe Harbour data transfer agreement between the US and EU to realise that data protection standards are becoming increasingly fractured. Individual companies will need to be in the vanguard of setting data protection standards, they cannot wait for governments to legislate.\n\nStandardisation can also extend beyond security provisions. The format and network these devices use should also be similar where possible. Consider the recent history of new technological devices. There have been reoccurring format wars, such as Betamax and VHS, Minidisk and MP3, and in the past few years, HD DVD and Blu-ray. As with most wars, there were losers, casualties, and a lot of money wasted. There were the manufacturers and suppliers that threw their lot in on the wrong side. For some that was the end of the road, for others it precipitated a painful pivot. Those who won also had to incur plenty of needless costs in marketing and lobbying distributors. Let's also not forget the annoyed consumer who forked out a lot of cash on devices and their favourite songs or movies in the right format only to find out they had to spend it all over again.\n\nThe work of GSMA and other groups to put in place structures and standards for IoT is very encouraging. We cannot wait for individual governments to create frameworks to make IoT safe. Cooperation between the businesses that operate in IoT will help the sector develop faster, save money, support innovation, and protect consumers. Although IoT is missing the 'killer app' that will make rapid adoption a reality, putting in the ground work on standardisation now will ensure that when IoT's 'iPhone moment' comes along, the sector will be able to protect consumers.", "Telecommunications company Telefonica has announced, during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, that it will soon implement a new feature which will allow it to track the user experience of its services in real-time.\n\nWith the new feature, it will be able to guarantee excellent connectivity and performance, it said, adding that customers will be able to enjoy their services without interruptions, pretty much ever.\n\nThe project is taking advantage of Big Data analytics - it will aggregate and analyse a bunch of anonymous data based on customer behaviour.\n\nIt will be implemented all over the world, however it will start in Chile and Argentina in the third quarter this year.\n\nTelef\u00f3nica's Global CTO, Enrique Blanco, has underlined that \"connectivity is the oxygen of digital life and that is why for Telef\u00f3nica it is vital that we provide customers with excellent connectivity, which means guaranteeing that they can be always connected, in any place and from any device, with the highest quality\".\n\nThe platform, which covers all of the Service Operations Centres in the country where it operates, will allow the company to anticipate and proactively react on possible black spots and other incidents.

(Xinhua)\n\nChinese telecommunications giant Huawei launched a 2-in-1 product that combines the mobility of a smartphone and productivity of a laptop at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona on Sunday, marking the firm's latest step to expand its consumer business.\n\nThe device, called the Huawei MateBook, retails from 799 euros in the European market and 699 U.S. dollars in the U.S. market. It will be made available across international markets from April onwards through both retail and e-commerce channels.\n\nThe core device of the MateBook is a tablet with a detachable keyboard much like Apple's iPad Pro, and runs Microsoft's latest operating system Windows 10.\n\nIt weighs 640 grams, compared to 713 grams for Apple's iPad Pro and the 766 grams of Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, both of which are portable tablets known for their lightweight design. It has a 12-inch screen.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook has a high-density lithium battery, which lasts for 10 hours once fully charged. The product features a sixth generation Intel Core m-series processor aimed at handling the most rigorous business demands.\n\nBuilt to operate on Windows 10, the MateBook also delivers tools and features offered by Microsoft Corp, including its latest browser, Microsoft Edge, and the Cortana digital personal assistant.\n\n\"We have decided to launch this product to answer the needs of business users. What makes our MateBook unique are are its compatibility and huge variety of functions,\" said Glory Zhang, chief marketing officer of Huawei Consumer Business.\n\nAlthough MateBook is being launched later than other comparable tablets, Zhang said it is no cause for concern because Huawei's strategy is to bring to market products once the technology involved can best satisfy consumer needs.\n\n\"We are not so concerned about being the first in a market. For example, when we launched our smartphone, the market was already filled with many smartphone makers, but our high quality allowed us to win market share.\"\n\n\"We have made good use of cutting edge technologies that we developed for our smartphone in our MateBook, which gives us a competitive strength,\" Zhang says.\n\nHuawei, founded in Shenzhen in 1987, has three core business areas. Its carrier business provides telecommunications services to operators like O2 and Telefonica, and it provides telecommunications services to corporate clients. Its third business area is consumer products.\n\nIn recent years its consumer business has picked up and has become a key factor in helping build the firm's brand across international markets. Its core products include the Huawei smartphone and Huawei Watch.\n\nHuawei is now the third-biggest player in the smartphone market after Apple and Samsung, and shipped 108 million smartphones in 2015, which represents a 44 percent increase in sales compared to 2014.\n\nNow Huawei is looking to make a major play in the tablet sector. Globally, tablet shipments fell 13.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2015, while shipments for detachable tablets reached an all-time high of 8.1 million devices, more than double from the same period in 2014, according to the research firm International Data Corporation.\n\nThe Huawei MateBook is being launched alongside the MatePen, which is used to write and draw on the MateBook. It has high sensitivity, can support graphics and mathematic functions and can be used as a laser pointer for delivering presentations.\n\nThe MateBook also has a one-touch unlocking system, which Huawei says is the fastest fingerprint recognition technology in the industry. Its technology supports 360 degrees sensitive identification, which leads to fewer identification failures than competitor technology.\n\nThe keyboard that accompanies MateBook features 1.5 millimeter keystroke and a Chiclet keycap design, which allows for larger key surfaces to minimize typing errors. The built-in touchpad uses multi-touch technology that supports finger movement and effectively combines comfort with function.", "News: Company aims to use analytics to improve customers' experiences.\n\nTelefonica is stepping into the big data world with the deployment of service operation centres in every country in which it operates.\n\nThe big data analytics project aims to analyse customer experiences in real-time, in addition to improving network quality.\n\nEach centre will be capable of monitoring the customer quality of experience and the quality of service, with the point of this is to proactively work on repairs and take action to improve the service.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress, Telefonica's global CTO Enrique Blanco named Huawei as the vendor supporting this week's demo at Mobile World Congress, but also said that other vendors such as Nokia and Ericsson were being evaluated.\n\nThis move comes as part of Telefonica's \"Onlife Telco\" plan, which would position the company as one that promotes connections in life for people to choose a world of infinite possibilities.\n\nThe plan will consist of six key elements: connectivity, integrated offerings, differential experience, big data, end-to-end digitalisation and capital allocation/simplification.\n\nThe big data element of the plan is beginning to come together with the deployment of the service operation centres. It will be hoping to use the data that it has in order to understand trends and to act upon them, with benefits to the customer being the central outcome.\n\nAccording to the company it has had big data analytics solutions for a while, but the company didn't implement them because it wanted to make sure that the tools were matured and proven.\n\nTelcos have come in for criticism in the past for a lack of agility when it comes to tackling OTTs, web players and an inability to make the most of their data.\n\nSebastien Deletaille, CEO, Real Impact Analytics, told CBR in an interview last year that: \"Telcos overall are probably one of the players that historically have the best industry to generate data, but have been completely unable to compete on that, to actually transform their business model to leverage the asset they have.\"\n\nDeletaille went on to say that because the people in charge of telecoms grew up in voice, they are not on top of data.\n\nTelefonica has been making strides to change how it operates in order to modernise the business. Brendon O'Rourke, CIO, Telefonica UK, spoke to CBR about how the company has been using Salesforce since 2012 for its digital business.\n\n\"It was disruptive. Like many other businesses we had pockets of Salesforce use in the sales teams. When we sat down in 2012 and looked at it, it was a disruptive project. And it was run from the tech department within the business,\" said O'Rourke. The full interview can be read here.\n\nThe opportunity that telcos have with their data has not gone unnoticed by large technology vendors such as SAP.\n\nAt Mobile World Congress this week the company revealed a Big Data Margin Assurance solution that is aimed at helping communication service providers make detailed information on margins and profits available to business users.\n\nOther telcos such as BT have moved to use data analytics to reduce the number of unwanted nuisance calls received by its landline customers.\n\nTelefonica's big data centres will first open in Argentina and Chile this year, followed by Spain and Germany. It will roll them out to all countries where it has operations by the end of 2017.", "Mark Mullane, software engineering manager for product development at Asavie.

These languages shook up the tech industry as new technologies like Go leapfrogged more established languages in popularity. Now that action may be slowing down, according to new data published by IT analysis firm RedMonk.\n\nFor the past five years RedMonk has tracked the popularity of different programming languages by charting the number of questions about each language asked on the popular programming question-and-answer site StackOverflow and the number of lines of code written in each language stored on the code hosting and collaboration site GitHub. These metrics don't tell us much about how widespread use of each language is in the commercial sector, nor how many jobs are available for developers conversant in particular language. But it does give us a way to ballpark the level of interest different technologies have garnered from developers themselves.\n\nNot much has changed since RedMonk released its last rankings in June 2015, more than six months ago. Swift managed to creep up one spot to 17 on the list, while Go held steady at 15. Rust moved up two spots, from 46 to 48, and Julia moved up one spot to 51. None of these languages are close to displacing the top languages. JavaScript, which is all over the web and an increasingly important part of mobile development thanks to tools such as Facebook's React, is still number one. Java, which is still used to build Android apps and powers big data technologies like Hadoop, is still number two. If Swift and Go are going to replace Objective C and Java, it's going to take some time.\n\nBut even though old languages may reign supreme, the crop of new languages has already altered the development landscape for years to come. Even as things stabilize, developers have more choices than ever.\n\nGo Back to Top.

No, Oracle isn't killing the Java programming language itself, which is still widely used by many companies. Nor is it killing off JavaScript, which is a completely different language that Oracle doesn't control. What Oracle is getting rid of is a plugin that allows you to run programs known as \"Java applets\" in your browser.\n\nYou may not think you even have the Java plugin installed, but if you've ever installed Java, or if Java came pre-installed on your computer, then you probably do, even if you never use it. The good news is that Oracle won't be automatically installing the Java plugin when you install Java anymore. The bad news is that it won't be providing security updates anymore either, so you should go ahead and uninstall it now. In fact, there's a good chance you can uninstall Java entirely.\n\nSun Microsystems, which was acquired by Oracle in 2010, introduced Java applets in 1995 and the technology was briefly popular with scientists and educators, who used them to create things such as interactive physics simulators. You can still relive the heyday of Java applets through UltraStudio, an online museum of educational applets, but Java has been mostly replaced by Flash and JavaScript for creating interactive programs on the web.\n\nUnfortunately, it's managed to stick around, thanks to Oracle's practice of bundling the plugin with the Java installer. That's made it a huge target for malware creators, and browser makers have slowly tried to phase the plugin out on their own. Google Chrome stopped supporting the plugin standard on which the Java plugin depends last year, and Mozilla has announced it will do the same by the end of the year. Microsoft Internet Explorer still supports the standard, but the newer Microsoft Edge browser does not.\n\nWith Microsoft dropping support for old versions of Internet Explorer and Adobe slowly phasing out Flash, it looks like a nightmarish era for web security is finally drawing to an end.\n\nGo Back to Top.

Hundreds of thousands of companies, including rivals like Netflix, rely on Amazon to host and support their information technology infrastructure. Now Walmart hopes to help these companies break their dependence on Amazon.\n\nNo, Walmart isn't getting into the cloud computing business to compete with its retail rival. But it has open sourced OneOps, a cloud management tool the company uses internally to run the infrastructure that underpins its e-commerce sites. Now any company will be able to use Walmart's software to create, manage, and migrate applications across multiple cloud computing infrastructures, including Amazon, Microsoft's Azure, and Rackspace. The point here isn't to hobble Amazon's cloud business. In fact, it could make it easier for some companies to use Amazon Web Services, since it will be easier to migrate applications between their own data centers and Amazon's cloud -- and they'll have to worry less about getting locked in to Amazon's services.\n\nWalmart decided to focus entirely on open source software so the company wouldn't be beholden to any one software vendor.\n\nThis fear of being locked in is what drove Walmart to acquire OneOps back in 2013, says Jeremy King, the CTO of Walmart Labs, the division of the company that handles software engineering for all of Walmart's brands.\n\nKing joined Walmart in 2011 with the mandate of modernizing the infrastructure that ran the company's e-commerce efforts. \"We realized the old tech stack wasn't going to cut it,\" he says. \"It was all five years from being end of life. So we needed to do cloud.\"\n\nKing and his team decided to focus entirely on open source software, so the company wouldn't be beholden to any one software vendor for the foreseeable future. They standardized on OpenStack, a tool that helps developers create their own Amazon-style clouds, and started acquiring companies, including OneOps, in order to bring experienced open source developers into Walmart.\n\nNow,by open sourcing OneOps, Walmart can work with the larger opens ource community to expand the tool's functionality and support even more technologies, making it possible manage whatever new software the company wants to adopt in the future.\n\nGo Back to Top.

According to a new report from DB-Engines, a site that tracks the popularity of database technologies, Oracle was not only the most widely used and discussed database in the world in 2015, it was also saw the most growth in those areas last year as well, at least by one metric.\n\nThat's a surprise because of the past few years, DB-Engines has tracked the rise of a number of newer database systems that discard the traditional way of organizing data in favor of the less structured approaches that Google and Facebook pioneered during their ascendancy in the mid-2000s. These so-called \"NoSQL\" databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis have dominated DB-Engines' listings of the fastest growing database technologies in the world, thanks in large part to their fresh approach to managing large or quickly changing volumes of data. What's more, these databases are open source, meaning that anyone in the world can view and edit the code that underpins their software. Oracle has always dominated the rankings, but the fastest growing databases have typically been the newer open source varieties.\n\nAn Austrian technology consulting firm called Solid IT created the DB-Engines rating system to help its developers decide which new technologies were worth learning about and which were still too nascent to bother with. The company assigns each database system a score based on data gathered from many sources, such as Google Trends, various job listings sites, social media sites like Twitter, and the programming questions and answers site StackOverflow. To determine the fastest growing database systems, the company looked at which ones had the biggest total change in their scores. There's a limit to DB-Engines' accuracy because the site can't say with certainty how many companies are using any particular technology. Rather it tries to approximate a database's popularity based on job listings and the ebb and flow of conversations about the technology.\n\nOracle has always been strong on the job listings side, Solid IT co-founder Matthias Gelbmann says, but the growth this year was primarily due to a big increase in the number of conversations about Oracle's flagship product on social media and Q&A sites.\n\nIt's not clear why the number of conversations about Oracle increased last year. It could be because more companies are using Oracle's flagship product, but Gelbmann speculates that it might be that older IT pros, the sorts who still use Oracle every day, are adopting social media tools at a faster rate. Or it could be that the large organizations that rely on Oracle technologies are hiring more of the young technologists who have traditionally turned to Stack Overflow when they have a problem. But he can't be certain, because DB-Engines only tracks the trends in the data, not the causes of those trends.\n\nDonnie Berkholz, an information technology analyst at 451 Research points out that sales of new Oracle database licenses have been declining in recent quarters, and that the DB-Engines team hasn't smoothed their data, which means that many of the peaks and valleys in the site's data could be statistical anomalies rather than meaningful changes. But he says that many companies still use Oracle for a variety of reasons, including pre-existing business relationships, difficulties in migrating to other other technologies, as well as technical requirements such as instrumentation, scaling, and performance.\n\nThe results don't indicate a comeback for other proprietary relational databases. While Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2 remain some of the most highly ranked databases on DB-Engines, both slipped slightly year-over-year. Meanwhile, the open source NoSQL databases MongoDB and Cassandra, some of the top movers since DB-Engines started ranking databases, came in second and third.\n\nThe lesson? The world is still adopting new, open source databases at a rapid clip. But old-school Oracle isn't going anywhere yet.\n\nGo Back to Top.

The company said today it will open source a core piece of its Edge web browser, the successor to Internet Explorer.\n\nMicrosoft will publish the source code for Chakra, the part of Edge responsible for running JavaScript code, next month on the code sharing and collaboration site GitHub, the company said in a blog post. What's more, the company will accept code contributions from developers outside of Microsoft -- a point driven home by the fact that it made the announcement not at a company event but at the JSConf US Last Call developers conference in Florida.\n\nThis move isn't the same thing as open sourcing the entire browser. You won't be able to actually browse web pages using ChakraCore. But Microsoft thinks its JavaScript engine will find use in a wide range of applications, such as games, cloud services and Internet of Things devices.\n\nThat may seem counterintuitive, given that JavaScript was originally created as a programming language for web browsers. But in recent years the language has found a home in other applications, thanks to Node.js, a platform for running JavaScript on servers or other computers. (Node.js depends on Google's V8, the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome.)\n\nWhy, then, would developers want to use Chakra instead of V8? Microsoft claims that Chakra has better support for the latest version of JavaScript. Chakra is already used by Microsoft outside of Edge to render JavaScript on the Xbox and Windows Phone, and on the server side for technologies from Cortana the Outlook.com.\n\nNode.js can already run on Chakra instead of V8, but only on Windows systems. But Microsoft will work to make Chakra available on other platforms, according to the company. Making the software open source will open up Microsoft's options for having it bundled with Linux distributions, as well make it possible for independent developers to port ChakraCore to other platforms.\n\nAnd by sharing the code for Chakra, browser developers at Apple, Google and Mozilla can learn from Microsoft's approach and potentially improve their own JavaScript rendering engines.\n\nGo Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.\n\nGoogle often gives its software away for free. It has long believed in open source software.\n\nBut last week, the company took this idea to the next level. It gave away all rights to Kubernetes, a cloud computing system originally designed by Google engineers, asking a non-profit to manage its development. It didn't just share some software code with the world. It agreed to let an independent party oversee the development of the code.\n\nDubbed the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the organization is just the latest in a series of high profile new foundations now stewarding opens source projects created by large tech companies. In the past year, we've also seen the launch of the Cloud Foundry Foundation to govern a project originally released by VMware, the establishment of the Node.js Foundation, thanks cloud services company Joyent, and the founding of the Open Container Initiative, thanks to several different companies, most notably Docker and CoreOS. All four of these new organizations are under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, the organization originally founded to manage the Linux Kernel, the core of all Linux operating systems.\n\nThanks to these foundations, competing companies -- and independent developers -- can come together to work on projects that benefit all of them without any one company owning the final product. That makes open source even more open. It makes it easier for the world to collaborate on new software.\n\nOpen source foundations are nothing new. Linux Foundation has been around since 2007, and other major projects like the Eclipse code editing tool and the Apache web server have been governed this way for even longer. Many of the most important open source projects in recent years, such as the Hadoop big data crunching platform and the database system Cassandra, are managed by the Apache Foundation. But it's unusual to see so many new foundations created so quickly.\n\nWhile the Linux kernel, Apache server, and Hadoop platform were all started initially as non-commercial projects, some of these new projects, like Cloud Foundry, have always been corporate products. And though some major open source projects remain corporate property, such as the MongoDB database, it's becoming harder and harder to name significant projects that aren't now part of a foundation. That's a good thing.\n\nGiving It Away\n\nWhy are so many companies giving away their intellectual property? It's not happening for altruistic reasons. In his keynote at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference in Portland, Oregon last week, Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji argued that the shift is being driven by economics.\n\nCompanies like Google want others to use their open source software since it can help drive the use of online services, like Google's cloud computing tools. They want others to contribute code to this software too. But increasingly, others don't want to use or contribute to projects unless they're independently managed.\n\nVenture capitalists have been pouring money into companies dedicated to commercializing open source projects, whether that's by providing support and services for open source projects or by building proprietary products atop open source code. Docker, for example, has raised $162 million million according to Crunchbase. But new business models for open source create new challenges for the companies that maintain them.\n\n\"Turns out with all of that money, you start to generate distrust,\" Ramji said. \"So some of the old nature of the open source model is starting to break down as these projects become bigger and more valuable, I think that's where foundations come in.\"\n\nFor example, IBM and HP offer cloud services based on Cloud Foundry. It would be in their best interests to contribute back to the main Cloud Foundry project, but they might be disinclined to do so by the fact that they compete directly with Pivotal, a company spun out of VMware and EMC in part to commercialize Cloud Foundry.\n\nWhen Pivotal owned all of the work that HP and IBM developers were putting into Cloud Foundry, there was always the possibility that the company could change the open source licensing, reject a competitor's contributions, or make changes to the project that didn't fit with the plans of outside contributors. One company was calling the shots, and it had to put its own interests first. So by putting its code into a neutral, independent organization, competitors can make mutually beneficial decisions without having to worry that all of their efforts will disappear overnight.\n\nThe Downside\n\nBut there are downsides to the foundation model, argues Derek Collison, one of the original creators of Cloud Foundry and the founder of Apcera, a startup that makes tools for managing cloud infrastructures. Foundations move slower than projects governed by a small team with clear goals, and innovation can be hampered by infighting, he says, echoing the reasons many open source project leaders have given for not placing their projects into foundations over the years.\n\n\"Design by consensus has never worked,\" he says. \"And it never will unless you have someone who says 'I know the pain points, I know how to drive it forward.'\"\n\nBut Collison isn't totally against the idea of foundations. In fact, Apcera is part of the Open Container Initiative that is helping standardize an increasingly popular technology called containers. He argues that relatively little design or innovation has to happen within the foundation. With the standard established, the member companies are free to innovate as they see fit, adding their own unique features atop the standard.\n\nStandards, Please\n\nStandardization is a major driving force many of these new projects, Linux Foundation director Jim Zemlin told us last year. \"Providing a huge standards document to a light bulb manufacturer won't help it make better, cheaper bulbs,\" Zemlin told us. \"But if you hand them the open source code, then they can just start doing it.\"\n\nAnd even if foundations move more slowly than companies, they might still win out in the end. Ramji cited a study conducted by Henrik Ingo in 2010 to compare governance models of open source projects. Ingo's conclusion: There appears to be a \"glass ceiling\" limiting the growth of of single vendor projects. In other words, if you want your project to grow, giving away the code to an independent organization is the best way to do that.\n\nGo Back to Top.

The messages asked victims to verify their email accounts by clicking on a link that took them to a phony website, where Helton collected their usernames and passwords.\n\nProsecutors say Helton used the information to access more than 360 email accounts.\n\nHelton, 29, is scheduled to be sentenced June 2.", "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to compel Apple to cooperate with a government investigation and help access data on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino assailants.\n\nThe motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (read it in full below) lays out the government's legal case for why Apple should provide technical assistance.\n\nIt could be viewed as a response to Apple's open letter this week stating why the company is refusing to assist -- as well as a preemptive move by the prosecutors ahead of Apple's own court filings expected next week.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on, and here for other NPR coverage on the standoff so far. As a very quick recap: The government had earlier gotten a court order directing Apple to create special software that would help investigators crack the phone's PIN code. Apple CEO Tim Cook's letter argued this would set a dangerous precedent and could undermine the security of all iPhones).\n\nIn the new motion, U.S. attorneys argue that Apple \"retains the technical ability to comply\" with the judge's order and that its \"current refusal to comply with the Court's Order, despite the technical feasibility of doing so, instead appears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\"\n\nThe filing specifies that the government \"has reason to believe\" that Syed Rizwan Farook used that iPhone to communicate \"with some of the very people\" he and his wife killed in the Dec. 2 mass shooting.\n\nThe tech industry, however, broadly views this as a precedent-setting case. For instance, experts' opinions vary on whether the government truly does require Apple's help to crack into the phone. (The filing argues that Apple's help is critical.) Google, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter have issued statements in support of Apple's opposition.\n\nOne of the biggest points of contention is whether this is a matter of writing software so carefully targeted to this individual phone that it wouldn't ever be usable to break into other phones. There's a lot we don't know about the way iPhone security technology works, and technical experts disagree on the feasibility of this task.\n\nApple itself, in simplest terms, doesn't want such software to exist to begin with. Cook suggested that software written specifically for one phone could be in danger of being tweaked to apply to other phones, via other government requests or by hackers.\n\nGovernment attorneys argue that such a threat is overstated. \"The software never has to come into the government's custody,\" the filing says. \"Just as with Apple's already-existing operating systems and software, no one outside Apple would have access to the software required by the order unless Apple itself chose to share it.\"\n\nBoth parties and the judge have also agreed on a timeline for this case, which many observers think could become a landmark in the long-running debate over privacy and surveillance.", "What is it about Silicon Valley? Why did this agriculturally gifted valley give birth to so many of the world's leading technology firms while simultaneously becoming the cultural landmark of the entrepreneurial spirit? Someone who not only has studied the Valley extensively but also was part of several Silicon Valley giants shares some insights with Religion & Liberty's associate editor, Sarah Stanley.\n\nRev. Bruce Baker began his career interested in entrepreneurship and technology but was called to the ministry two decades in. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in applied science from the California Institute of Technology in 1978 and a Master of Business Administration from Stanford University in 1981. Baker cofounded Four Pi Systems Corporation, where he earned five patents for his inventions in X-ray physics, computer software and machine vision. After the company was bought out by Hewlett Packard in 1992, Baker began managing in the brand-new department of handheld mobile computing devices at Microsoft. After four years at Microsoft, he was called to attend seminary. He received a Master of Divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary in 2001 and a Doctor of Philosophy in theological ethics from the University of St. Andrews in 2010. He is ordained as a pastor in the Presbyterian Church (USA) and serves as executive pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Bellevue, Washington. In 2010, he began teaching business ethics at Seattle Pacific University where he is also the main contributor to the scholarship and research activities of the Center for Integrity in Business.\n\nR&L: In your work, you've asked a question that many others have asked about Silicon Valley: How did this \"gratuitously gifted\" region give birth to so many world-class technology companies? But your explanation uses \"biblical motifs\" to describe the innovation and entrepreneurship there. How do you connect these biblical themes and concepts with the technical and very secular culture that prevails in Silicon Valley?\n\nRev. Bruce Baker: I think we learn something about entrepreneurship and the history of the Valley by using the biblical motif and looking at it through a theological lens. At the outset I need to say that there's also a risk here. The risk is that we start to think there's something religiously motivated in this wave of entrepreneurship and technology, and there's not. I don't believe there is. Rather, what I'm asking is, What can we learn about human nature, about how entrepreneurship works and about what makes it a good thing for human flourishing? What can we learn about that by looking at it through a biblical lens?\n\nWhen I do that, the first thing I see is the parallel between the story of the original founders, the \"Traitorous Eight\" of Fairchild Semiconductor. Led by Bob Noyce, they became sort of the seed, the progenitors of generation after generation of these inventive, productive, exciting technology companies that followed on after them, with Intel being the big one that came next. Noyce was one of the founders of Intel. It was in 1957 that they left Shockley Semiconductor, founded Fairchild and launched this new initiative. Now here are the things I find in common: When I look at it and compare what they did to the Exodus story, it's just interesting. In both cases there's a valley and there's a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\nDuring the 20th century, it was called \"The Valley of Heart's Delight.\" Everything grew there: apricots, cherries, almonds, peaches, pears, plums. And so it was a garden. In both cases, there's a visionary leader. In both cases, the people are entering this new land with an idea that they're going feels different somehow. I want to study that next.\n\nYou've already briefly touched on this. Other U.S. regions, and other countries, have tried to replicate Silicon Valley. But the Valley has a deeply networked infrastructure of talent, service companies, world-class universities and venture capital and other finance firms. Can you instill what amounts to a spirit of innovation in another place and culture that easily, and is the Valley's success repeatable?\n\nWell, I think it was organic in the Valley. So I don't think it was instilled, per se. The closest thing you can come to saying that it was intended or instilled would be to look at Frederick Terman. Terman was the distinguished professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. And he was a teacher of Hewlett and Packard. He encouraged them to go and create -- a metaphorical \"Go West, young man\" sort of speech they got from him to create new technology. And he saw the opportunity for Stanford University, in particular his field of electrical engineering, to create a fresh wave of innovation and industry. So he was a visionary that way. But if there is a way to instill it, it's a mystery. I guess the closest thing I can point to would be a kind of faith for trusting that new technology will create opportunities that we haven't even foreseen yet. And that it's worth investing in for its own sake, even though you can't see how it's going to pay off. It doesn't matter. It's worth doing anyway.\n\nBut you don't see a copy of Silicon Valley popping up in, say, India or somewhere?\n\nWell, it's happening . . . it is happening all over. I mean, India has Bangalore -- although I haven't been there -- is an example. Hyderabad is another one; it's kind of similar. It's got a whole fresh wave of tech entrepreneurs. And what we're seeing now is actually people who have earned their chops in America, in universities and high-tech businesses, going back to India. Many of the Indian nationals are going back to India. In fact, I have a friend from Microsoft who did that. He was a manager at Microsoft. Indian-born, very successful manager at Microsoft. He left Microsoft, started a new software company and went back to India to start there. So it is happening around different places. It's not just something you can plan. I think it's organic, which, again, fits with our biblical understanding of how things happen.\n\nIn his book Knowledge and Power, George Gilder wrote that the market economy, or capitalism, is by nature giving because the risk it assumes is uncertainty; no real knowledge or assurance exists in a world of \"unfathomable complexity that requires constant efforts of initiative, sympathy, discovery and love.\" Socialism is deterministic, capitalism is altruistic. Does that ring true in light of what you've seen in the tech world?\n\nIt does. And I think the key is this: there's an element of grace in it. And I think it catches most people by surprise. And it sounds like an oxymoron, to think that what keeps the economy alive is grace. But I fully believe it does. What keeps the economy alive is the same thing that keeps the human spirit alive. It's grace. And a healthy economy has grace embedded in it somehow. Every transaction needs to contain an element of concern and care for the shalom of others and the shalom of the community. Or else that economic system will die. And history has shown that repeatedly. So I completely believe that. And I think you raised a really good connection there, because entrepreneurship is a place where that's essential. The Silicon Valley model, and entrepreneurship in general, is not ultimately driven by money. It's not driven by someone's desire for money. It's just not. It's driven by a desire to create something of use, to create something of value. The money certainly comes . . . it's just secondary. The money comes in as the necessity of doing it in a way that's pragmatic and sustainable and enables you to create jobs and get it done. But the thing at the heart of creation is not money. It's the desire to create something of value or something beautiful.\n\nLet's talk about the ethical and moral culture in the tech industry. There's a deep strain of technocratic thinking that approaches almost every human or social problem as something that might be fixed with better software code or a new app. But you've said that no amount of \"social entrepreneurship\" will do much good unless people are willing to actively address corruption, dishonesty and chaos. How has that message been received?\n\nThat is a tough one because there are so many great advantages to using data and applied big data in ways to create new efficiencies or monetize relationships. So there's a tremendous economic force we're dealing with that wants to commoditize. Here's where I think we risk crossing the line: it's when we commoditize human relationships or the humanity of the relationship in the workplace. The big power of big data creates a pressure in that direction. The pressure in that direction, eventually, in some places, is going to cross that line. The hard question is figuring out where it crosses the line. Because a lot of what it does is really good. It helps cure disease. It helps eliminate poverty. It helps people in struggling third-world economies to actually have an opportunity to make things better that they didn't have before. So big data is a gift in that sense. So where does it cross the line? And what I keep going back to in my studies and teaching of this is that I keep asking, \"Well, what's the impact this is having on human dignity?\" And so that comes back to the question, What does it mean to be human? That brings us back to our faith at some point. We eventually end up there. And you have to ask whether the way we're doing this is contributing to human dignity and human flourishing or whether it's somehow demeaning it or impinging on it? It's a tough question.\n\nWith many tech entrepreneurs viewing their businesses as essentially social institutions, does that make it easier to view their work more deeply, especially in a sense of vocation or mission in a Christian context?\n\nAnother great question. Yes, it helps. There's an opportunity here, and we're seeing a lot of good tech companies take advantage of that. Microsoft does it. Google does it. Many others. They have an expectation that their employees are going to use some of their time to be involved in social purposes, using their skills and their gifts. And I admire that. And I think what that does for the company, whether it's Microsoft or Google or whoever, is create an awareness within the community of work that we're involved in a greater reality. We're not just playing a game. It's not just about winning the most market share or winning the most users. There's actually a greater reality here. When companies deliberately pay attention to that, I think that builds up the ethics of their own company internally for what they're doing. Don't be evil. This is Google's mantra.\n\nBut, yes, it keeps people mindful. And mindfulness is important. Mindfulness, actually, is one of those analogs that I'm studying in my research. Because I'm looking at how companies keep people mindful of this, just what you're asking about. And so I think you're hitting on one of those analogs that does that and helps build up the ethical climate.\n\nThe tech world is a place where great successes and unimaginable riches have been achieved and celebrated widely. You don't hear much about failure, which is a lot more frequent than success. How do you pastor people who are dealing with shattered entrepreneurial dreams?\n\nWell, I think it's largely a hypothetical question for me. Just so you know, I'm not talking about any particular person or particular case. But the fundamental thing is recognizing that our life is in God. I'm coming back to basics: understanding who you are.\n\nFor me, it's about identity. That's the key thing. I want to help draw people back to their true identity. A shattered dream, that's not your true identity, I would counsel that person. That is what is happening in your life journey at this moment, to this company you are involved with or to this venture you're involved with. That's not you. Your identity is in Christ and him alone. And from my personal experience, then, I can share with them how I've experienced that, because I have. When we look back on our lives, I think any one of us can ask, \"What have we really learned that really matters? Where's there wisdom in my life?\" Guess where we end up coming from? We end up coming from the failures and the pains, because that's where the real wisdom came from.\n\nAnd it turns out to be a wisdom we never asked for. We didn't want it, but yet there it is. And that is how God works in our lives. My experience, he takes everything and uses it. And that has amazed me about our God. He takes everything and uses it. All the pain, the horrible things that happen, the failures -- he does something with them. And so the blessing is to know him and to know that's who he is and to know that's what he does. And a lot of times that's hard to see, so the pastor's role in that situation is to understand that that person can't see clearly and to walk alongside them in the midst of it. Ultimately, the pastor's job is to be able to point to that reality without being able to heal it.\n\nAs a pastor, how do you bring the gift of the gospel to a tech culture that may be thoroughly unchurched or even hostile to Christianity -- especially in a diverse, multicultural place where many may have been raised in spiritual traditions outside of Christianity?\n\nWhat people need in that situation is a winsome witness.\n\nSo what does that look like? They need to see someone who is living their life in a way that there's something attractive and winsome about it -- in the way they handle adversity, in the way they treat the people around them. I've noticed people like that at work, for example, in that tech culture. And I've noticed something about that person. I've never heard him or her demean another person in a meeting. I've seen that person always be an encouragement. And you notice little things like that, the more explicit things. That helps. The other explicit thing you can do -- that is noticeable, that helps people -- again, is to help them get their bearings, help them get their context. Remind them who they are and always be reminding them of the greater reality, that, whether this product succeeds or fails, it's not going to change who they are.\n\nAnd one way of reminding them of that is what changes people's lives -- to get into relationships. So helping them to be involved in relationships outside of the high-pressure, high-stakes, high-intensity game they're caught in, which is a great, fun game, you know? But when it wraps people up, they can lose their bearings. So, again, it's helpful to have some involvement in something outside of that. It could be a social venture. It could be initiatives at work that take our technology and use it in ways purely motivated by serving. It's looking at our company and business as service and always putting that first. So there's a variety of ways to try to help cultivate those relationships and make them part of our workplace culture.", "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Oregon man who accessed hundreds of email accounts and stole explicit photos of celebrities pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony hacking charge in Los Angeles.\n\nAndrew Helton of Astoria, Oregon, faces up to five years in prison after pleading guilty to stealing nude or explicit photos from 13 people, including some unidentified celebrities.\n\nHundreds of stolen nude images of stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis have been posted online in recent years.\n\nFBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller says Helton's is a separate case and that none of the images he stole are believed to have leaked online.\n\nHelton's attorney Shanon L.

The longer they waited, the less credit they get. The smart thing was to say not just 'yeah, we support them' but 'hell yeah, we support them,\" Saffo said.\n\nThe U.S. government went back to court Friday in an attempt to force Apple to comply with a court order directing the company to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone used by one of the assailants in the December mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people.\n\nA federal judge ordered Apple this week to bypass security functions on the iPhone, igniting a public fight between the Obama administration and Apple, with the world's most valuable company declaring it would not comply with the order to hack into the phone.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google, was the first head of a major tech company to side with Apple, saying in a series of tweets on Wednesday that \"forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users' privacy\" and would set a \"troubling precedent.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSnowden backs Apple in fight over iPhone, calls on Google to speak up\n\nFacebook followed with more forceful language on Thursday, warning of a \"chilling precedent\" and pledging to \"fight aggressively\" against government efforts to \"weaken the security\" of consumer tech products.\n\nCEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Twitter's support, later on Thursday: \"We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFacebook, Twitter side with Apple in iPhone fight\n\nMicrosoft and Yahoo initially referred reporters to written statements from industry trade groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith tweeted a link to a trade group statement, saying \"essential to have broad public discussion on these important issues.\" Late Thursday Smith tweeted the link again and made a stronger statement: \"In a world where we need to keep both the public safe and privacy rights secure, backdoors take us backwards.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYahoo backs Apple in fight over iPhone\n\nYahoo's chief information security officer Bob Lord on Friday said on Twitter: \"Ordering a company to hack one targeted system is clearly the first step to ordering them to backdoor them all. #slipperySlope#usersfirst.\" Yahoo spokeswoman Suzanne Philion confirmed the tweet reflected the official position of the Internet giant. Yahoo had previously referred reporters to statements from industry groups.\n\nStill, if the courts say Apple has to comply, there's really nothing other tech companies can do to help, said analyst Dawson. \"As far as I know, the other big tech companies have always complied in the past with similar court orders, as has Apple, and I suspect they'll continue to do so in future,\" Dawson said. \"So even if they respect Apple's stance here, it's hard for them to back it to the hilt.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn @jguynn\n\n35 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TvhnpO", "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Oregon man who accessed hundreds of email accounts and stole explicit photos of celebrities pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony hacking charge in Los Angeles.\n\nAndrew Helton of Astoria, Oregon, faces up to five years in prison after pleading guilty to stealing nude or explicit photos from 13 people, including some unidentified celebrities.\n\nHundreds of stolen nude images of stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis have been posted online in recent years.\n\nFBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller says Helton's is a separate case and that none of the images he stole are believed to have leaked online.\n\nHelton's attorney Shanon L.

Henry Nickel, a San Bernardino city councilman, said that he is \"extremely disappointed\" in Apple's position.\n\n\"I do not feel that digital data is in any way subject to additional protection from search or seizure than any other aspect of our lives,\" Nickel said in an email. \"If Apple fails to comply with a warrant it is in violation of the law in the same way a landlord is in violation for failing to unlock a suspect's apartment door or a bank to release information related to an individual's financial data. Apple is simply wrong if it believes digital information is somehow more sacred than any other type of information.\"\n\nHe went on to say he thinks Apple's position will be found \"baseless and a violation of law, effectively and obstruction of justice.\"\n\nSan Bernardino Mayor R. Carey Davis was a little more moderate in his reply, but also said in a statement that he hopes Apple will cooperate with the authorities.\n\n\"The attack on December 2nd was the deadliest terrorist attack in the US since 9/11, and law enforcement officials continue to follow up on leads related to the case,\" he said. \"Officials do not know whether any information related to the investigation exists on the phone, but the judge's decision is appropriate given the nature of the attack, and the potential to uncover clues related to this terrorist attack and/or future attacks.

The amount transferred to Bermuda was 16 percent greater than the prior year, according to documents the subsidiary filed with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce on Feb. 4 and made available this week. The filing was first reported by the Dutch magazine Quote.\n\nThe revelation comes as Google faces outrage in Europe over the small amount of tax it pays in the region. Last month, after Google reached a controversial $187 million settlement with the U.K. government over an audit covering 10 years of accounts, critics called the amount \"derisory.\" The deal spawned parliamentary hearings, a government audit and scrutiny from the European Union. France and Italy are also reportedly in discussions with Google to settle ongoing tax disputes. Outside of Europe, legislators in Australia have in recent weeks questioned whether the company is paying a fair share of tax there.\n\n\"Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate,\" the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nGoogle's Dutch subsidiary is the heart of tax structures known as a \"Double Irish\" and a \"Dutch Sandwich\" because it involves moving money from one Google subsidiary in Ireland to a Google subsidiary in the Netherlands before moving it out again to a different Irish subsidiary, physically based in Bermuda, where there is no corporate income tax.\n\nThis movement of cash enables Google parent Alphabet to keep the effective tax rate on its international income in the single digits. For 2015, Alphabet reported its average tax rate outside the U.S. was just 6.3 percent, according to a calculation using the income from foreign operations and the foreign income tax reported in its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Figures for 2015 revenue moved through Google's Dutch subsidiary aren't available.\n\nThe company says this calculation does not reflect the methods actually used to determine its international taxes in any jurisdiction. Those methods involve transfer pricing, where payments between various international subsidiaries are used to attribute profit to the geographies where economic value is deemed to have been created. The amount of these payments are based on estimates of what similar transactions with an unrelated company would cost. Google attributes most of the economic value of its products to its research and development operations in the U.S. and, in the case of its overseas sales, to its Bermuda-based subsidiary, which holds the international licenses for Google's intellectual property.\n\nThe Irish tax loophole that makes the \"Double Irish\" possible was closed by the Irish parliament last year. But companies already using the structure can continue to employ it until the end of 2020.\n\nLast week, Tom Hutchinson, Google's vice president for finance, defended the company's tax arrangements before a U.K. parliamentary committee. Noting that its average global tax rate for the past five years was 19 percent, Hutchinson said Google paid \"a fair amount\" of tax worldwide.\n\nHe also said that the complex structure through which Google moves most of its international profits through its Dutch subsidiary and then on to Bermuda, \"made sense\" given that the U.S. government taxes companies on their foreign income if they bring it back into the U.S. This gives multinationals an incentive to keep those profits overseas and in locations with little or no corporate tax.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Alphabet's foreign subsidiaries were holding $43 billion in cash untaxed by the U.S., according to the company's SEC filings.", "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to compel Apple to cooperate with a government investigation and help access data on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino assailants.\n\nThe motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (read it in full below) lays out the government's legal case for why Apple should provide technical assistance.\n\nIt could be viewed as a response to Apple's open letter this week stating why the company is refusing to assist -- as well as a preemptive move by the prosecutors ahead of Apple's own court filings expected next week.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on, and here for other NPR coverage on the standoff so far.

The longer they waited, the less credit they get. The smart thing was to say not just 'yeah, we support them' but 'hell yeah, we support them,\" Saffo said.\n\nThe U.S. government went back to court Friday in an attempt to force Apple to comply with a court order directing the company to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone used by one of the assailants in the December mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people.\n\nA federal judge ordered Apple this week to bypass security functions on the iPhone, igniting a public fight between the Obama administration and Apple, with the world's most valuable company declaring it would not comply with the order to hack into the phone.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google, was the first head of a major tech company to side with Apple, saying in a series of tweets on Wednesday that \"forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users' privacy\" and would set a \"troubling precedent.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSnowden backs Apple in fight over iPhone, calls on Google to speak up\n\nFacebook followed with more forceful language on Thursday, warning of a \"chilling precedent\" and pledging to \"fight aggressively\" against government efforts to \"weaken the security\" of consumer tech products.\n\nCEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Twitter's support, later on Thursday: \"We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFacebook, Twitter side with Apple in iPhone fight\n\nMicrosoft and Yahoo initially referred reporters to written statements from industry trade groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith tweeted a link to a trade group statement, saying \"essential to have broad public discussion on these important issues.\" Late Thursday Smith tweeted the link again and made a stronger statement: \"In a world where we need to keep both the public safe and privacy rights secure, backdoors take us backwards.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYahoo backs Apple in fight over iPhone\n\nYahoo's chief information security officer Bob Lord on Friday said on Twitter: \"Ordering a company to hack one targeted system is clearly the first step to ordering them to backdoor them all. #slipperySlope#usersfirst.\" Yahoo spokeswoman Suzanne Philion confirmed the tweet reflected the official position of the Internet giant. Yahoo had previously referred reporters to statements from industry groups.\n\nStill, if the courts say Apple has to comply, there's really nothing other tech companies can do to help, said analyst Dawson. \"As far as I know, the other big tech companies have always complied in the past with similar court orders, as has Apple, and I suspect they'll continue to do so in future,\" Dawson said. \"So even if they respect Apple's stance here, it's hard for them to back it to the hilt.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn @jguynn\n\n35 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TvhnpO", "Donald Trump escalated his attack on Apple Inc. on the final day of campaigning before the Republican primary in South Carolina, calling for a boycott until Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook honors a court order to unlock a terrorist's iPhone.\n\n\"Boycott Apple until they give up the information,\" Trump said at a rally in Pawleys Island, S.C. \"The phone is owned by the government. ...

The S6 and S6 edge plug into the Gear VR headset and function as the headset's display and processor.

If so, my dear, now is the time to clear it up.\n\nI bring this up because if you are dating and getting mixed results, sometimes it can be as simple as this: you're giving off mixed energetic signals. As \"woo-woo\" New Age-y as that may sound, when we're still attached to someone, it can prevent a new Mr. Wonderful from being able to come forward -- because he is likely picking up that you are not really available.\n\n\"Hold on a second,\" you might be saying. \"How can I tell whether or not I'm still attached to an ex-flame?\" Search your heart and actions: do you say his name often? Do you look at his social media, compare him to current dates or still occasionally have \"feelings\" for him? A \"yes\" to any of the above questions means it's likely you haven't truly released him.\n\nDon't fret, though. It's possible for you to do some \"inner\" work about him to get clear about what \"went wrong,\" which can give you some healthy perspective about why you're no longer together.\n\nI suggest if you recognize the importance of doing some inner work you find a way to either revisit that old love in some form -- in order to more clearly understand its purpose and potential -- or get professional help so as to transform the experience.\n\nCertainly, you can find a wide variety of approaches to consider, when choosing to do your own inner work to more fully release any lingering attachments to your ex. (Just \"Google\" the phrase \"inner work to release attachments\" and you'll see what I mean.) Please note: I advise using your intuition in any such exploration, so you're being led by something more \"in touch\" with your true needs. But some examples include: write a \"letting go of you\" letter to him, which you don't deliver, but instead ceremoniously burn or bury, or do a ritual in which you \"objectively witness and say goodbye\" to the abridged \"movie\" of your relationship with him.\n\nChoosing to get some professional help can have a variety of faces: counselors, pastors, energy workers, shamans, massage therapists, etc. The goal of getting professional help is to consciously recognize, understand and be willing to let go of or revamp the pattern between the two of you, so as to either go forward separately and independently with a healthier, more illumined perspective or determine you're going to consciously commit to being in a relationship together again, with a clear understanding of your breakdown.\n\nI consider it wise to get as clear as possible (i.e., a thorough, conscious sense of \"the lay of the land\") to decode the cause(s) of your breakup and whether you need more information to determine your course forward. If reconciliation is on the table, what is going to be different this time? As Albert Einstein allegedly once observed, \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.\"\n\nWhether on your own or with the help of a professional, pay close attention to what slips easily into place and what feels natural. Mind your body and the signals you get, both when you're around him and when you're on your own. Tap in deeply: are you anxious or scattered around him? Do you feel drained? Are you happy and content, and do you breathe easily while you're with him? Do you feel at peace... or not so much? Do you feel loved, supported, heard, free, trusted, enough? Only occasionally? Listen with your whole being as you respond to these important questions.\n\nIn the healing arts, we work on the body to release old trauma... but such work can also reveal a lot about your \"true north\" and whether or not this relationship is a \"right fit.\" Often enough, your body just knows what your mind may not know how to explain. I cannot emphasize this point enough: pay attention to how you feel.\n\nClean up your unfinished business, Intrepid One! You never know who might show up!", "SUNNYVALE -- After years of perpetual turnaround efforts, Yahoo is stepping closer to a sale.\n\nHere's a look at five pivotal events that led Yahoo to where it is today.\n\nYahoo brought in Terry Semel, a former chairman and co-CEO of Warner Bros., as its CEO in 2001. Semel's main jobs were to provide Yahoo with some executive experience and turn the company into an Internet media leader. Instead, Semel left Yahoo in 2007 following a salary dispute.\n\nHowever, Semel's tenure is probably best known for Yahoo failing to buy Google when it had the chance. Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page told Semel they wanted $1 billion, but didn't want to sell. Semel later agreed to the $1 billion price, but Brin and Page upped their demands to $3 billion. And Yahoo never bought Google.\n\nFeb. 1, 2008, may end up as Yahoo's day of infamy. On that date, Microsoft made an unsolicited, $44.6 billion cash and stock offer to acquire Yahoo. CEO and co-founder Jerry Yang said no, arguing that Microsoft's offer undervalued Yahoo. Microsoft eventually raised its bid by $5 billion, or $33 a share, but Yang and Yahoo wanted more, and demanded $37 a share. Microsoft withdrew its offer and by November 2008, Yahoo shares fell below $9.\n\nAfter Yahoo turned down Microsoft, Jerry Yang gave up his CEO job and was replaced by former Autodesk chief Carol Bartz in January 2009. Bartz was known for her salty language as much as for her penchant for secrecy among Yahoo's executive ranks and rounds of company layoffs. By 2010, the proxy-voting firm Glass Lewis called Bartz the most-overpaid CEO in America after she received a compensation package of $42.7 million.\n\nBartz was fired as CEO in September 2011 via a phone call from the company's then-chairman, Roy Bostock.\n\nScott Thompson's r\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nIf you blinked, you might have missed Thompson's CEO tenure. Thompson, a former PayPal executive, became Yahoo's CEO on Jan. 4, 2012. Three months later, Yahoo announced 2,000 job cuts, or about 14 percent of its employee base at the time.\n\nAnd then in May 2012, Dan Loeb, manager of the Third Point hedge fund, which at the time owned almost 6 percent of Yahoo's stock, released documents suggesting Thompson had misrepresented his college education. Thompson had said he held degrees in accounting and computer science from Stonehill College, but it turned out Thompson only held an accounting degree. The controversy became so much that Thompson resigned after barely four months as Yahoo's CEO.\n\nMarissa Mayer takes charge\n\nFollowing Thompson's brief period as CEO, Yahoo looked to make a splash with its next leader, and in July 2012 hired Google engineer and executive Marissa Mayer. At 37, Mayer was the youngest Fortune 500 CEO at the time. And nearly every move Mayer has made since coming to Yahoo has garnered headlines and sparked some controversy.\n\nMayer led Yahoo's $1.1 billion acquisition of the Tumblr blog site in 2013. She instituted controversial performance reviews in which managers were to rank employees on a bell curve and fire those at the bottom. Mayer revamped Yahoo's remote-working policy and required all employees to work from company offices. She hired Katie Couric to be the chief global anchor of Yahoo News and brought in noted tech guru David Pogue to launch the Yahoo Tech Site.\n\nBut as Yahoo's share price fell more than 34 percent in 2015, investors and fund managers raised their voices about everything from Mayer's business strategy to how much Yahoo spent on its holiday party. Activist investment firms such as Starboard and SpringOwl Asset Management have threatened proxy fights to replace Mayer and Yahoo's board at the company's next annual meeting.", "Kim Kardashian is seeking comfort from her family after having a \"rough week\" after her husband Kanye West 's venomous rants.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, who welcomed their second child Saint in December last year, has allegedly been suffering as the Power hitmaker keeps launching into furious tirades on Twitter.\n\n\"It's been a rough week for Kim,\" a family source told PEOPLE.\n\n\"She has lots of support from her family though.\"\n\nKanye's rants have gone to a whole new level, and it has taken its toll on the 35-year-old.\n\n\"Everyone knows that Kanye, once in a while, goes on public rants and they are all very understanding that it's exhausting for Kim. It's like a tick that he has,\" he said.\n\nKanye appeared to have taken some time out from all that Twitter ranting - after all, it must be energy-consuming sharing such deep thoughts on a daily basis.\n\nThe rapper shared a sweet tribute to his daughter North today, posting a cute photo of the youngster and describing her as \"my heart\".\n\nNorth is stood with her family in white fur in the photo, presumably at Kanye's recent clothes launch, and is staring right at the camera with her adorable moody expression in place.\n\nWe wonder where she gets it from.\n\nMy Heart pic.twitter.com/Yt11QcelpN -- KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)\n\nFebruary 19, 2016\n\nKanye had been feeling positive as he also spoke out to thank Drake for helping him with his recent work.\n\nHe wrote: \"I wanna thank my brother Drizzy for helping me on 30 Hours & Father Stretch My Hands.\n\n\"Drake would come by and just help, no strings.

According to recent discoveries in the Chromium Bug Tracker, there have been references made to \"zine\" and \"morning reads\", with the former referring to \"magazines\".

It has also been suggested that Chrome could coalesce with other wake-up events, like an alarm perhaps.\n\nNo word on whether Google will actually make this a feature available to the public, and since companies like Google tend to test features every so often, it's hard to say if this is just an experimental feature or a possible future build of Chrome.", "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to compel Apple to cooperate with a government investigation and help access data on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino assailants.\n\nThe motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (read it in full below) lays out the government's legal case for why Apple should provide technical assistance.\n\nIt could be viewed as a response to Apple's open letter this week stating why the company is refusing to assist -- as well as a preemptive move by the prosecutors ahead of Apple's own court filings expected next week.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on, and here for other NPR coverage on the standoff so far.

At the same time, the company says it may show an additional ad -- four, not three -- above the search results for what it calls \"highly commercial queries.\"\n\nAll of this represents the conclusion of a test that began all the way back in 2010, and has been tweaked over the years since then. Search Engine Land readers -- particularly some outside the U.S. -- notified us late last year that they were seeing the top-only ads more frequently.\n\nA Google spokesperson has confirmed to Search Engine Land that the change is now rolling out to all searches in all languages worldwide. Ads will not appear on the right side of desktop search results, with one exception: Product Listing Ad (PLA) boxes will continue to show both above and to the right of search results.\n\nThe additional fourth ad that may show above the search results will only show up for highly commercial queries, according to Google's official statement on the change:\n\n\"We've been testing this layout for a long time, so some people might see it on a very small number of commercial queries. We'll continue to make tweaks, but this is designed for highly commercial queries where the layout is able to provide more relevant results for people searching and better performance for advertisers.\"\n\nTo clarify, the elimination of right-side ads impacts all desktop searches worldwide; the addition of the fourth ad above search results will happen for \"highly commercial queries.\" This would involve searches like \"hotels in New York City\" or \"car insurance\" and the like.\n\nThe removal of all right-side ads obviously makes the desktop and mobile search results more similar. On mobile, though, Google typically shows either two or three ads at the top of the search results.\n\nPostscript: Search Engine Land was tipped to this change via email from a Google advertiser that wishes to remain anonymous, as well as the folks at The Media Image who wrote about the change yesterday.\n\nPostscript #2: Google originally told Search Engine Land that there were two exceptions to the right-side change: PLA boxes and the Knowledge Panel. A spokesperson tells us that's not the case, and that PLA boxes will be the only time ads will continue to show on the right side of the desktop search results page.

The platform itself has changed so drastically that, within its own space, methods of advertising have already changed or become obsolete. At least with newspapers people understand how it works: You buy a certain amount of space on a page and the price is based upon distribution and possibly placement. End of story.\n\nIn the world online, however, it is much more complex than that, leaving would-be advertisers never quite sure about what they are buying. Purchasing ads with large online companies, such as Google, YouTube or Facebook, can seem easy but there is a certain amount of unknown trust there since it's a relatively new space. Technology is supposed to target demographics and other very tight specifics but that doesn't always guarantee that it works.\n\nWhen new websites come out that build large audiences quickly, there is often a desire to turn regular usage into some sort of advertising or promotional tool. That is now starting to happen with Periscope, the personal video broadcasting tool now owned by Twitter.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Periscope. If you visit the website, you will notice the ability to download the app to your iPhone or Android device (support is now also included for Apple TV). Once on your device you can either watch other people streaming video or create your own. The tagline is \"Explore the world through somebody else's eyes\" and this is appropriate. As a broadcaster, you would turn Periscope on and give it access to your camera and microphone during some sort of special event or activity. Anybody out there can now watch in real time.\n\nWhile live-stream video sites, such as YouTube and Twitch.TV, already exist, they are not necessarily intended to be used exclusively with mobile devices. Those services also archive videos so you can watch them later on. With Periscope, broadcasts are live and then disappear within 24 hours. It's truly meant to capture and celebrate the moment (although there are services available, such as Katch, that preserve streams from Periscope and its competitor Meerkat). Periscope turns everyone with a cellphone into a mobile news broadcasting service.\n\nConsumer giant Nestle recently turned to Periscope to help promote Delissio, it's line of frozen pizzas. To help celebrate National Pizza Day, Delissio allowed users to watch different flavours of the pizza rise in real-time in ovens. It was a clever and effective use of the platform and is likely the first of many such promotions to come.\n\nWhile business promotion may seem a likely coupling with the service, I see many personal events taking over the platform. Imagine being able to easily share a snippet of a birthday party with relatives who can't make it because of time or geographical restrictions, or have your spouse be able to join you while your child performs in a school play. Sure, it would be okay to watch it after the fact but there is something about being able to share moments together at the same time that has its own intrinsic value.\n\nPeriscope is not without its problems. Several copyrighted events (such as boxing matches) have been broadcast on the service in real time, allowing some to watch without paying. The service has to work on ways to prevent illegal use of its service, which is difficult. Only time will tell how this particular issue will be dealt with but I have no doubt they will find a way to limit such uses.\n\nCan you imagine what you would want to live broadcast? At first the idea might just plain scare you, but then think about all the moments in your life you wish you could have shared with your friends and family with the ease of a few taps.

The smart thing was to say not just 'yeah, we support them' but 'hell yeah, we support them,\" Saffo said.\n\nThe U.S. government went back to court Friday in an attempt to force Apple to comply with a court order directing the company to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone used by one of the assailants in the December mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people.\n\nA federal judge ordered Apple this week to bypass security functions on the iPhone, igniting a public fight between the Obama administration and Apple, with the world's most valuable company declaring it would not comply with the order to hack into the phone.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google, was the first head of a major tech company to side with Apple, saying in a series of tweets on Wednesday that \"forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users' privacy\" and would set a \"troubling precedent.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSnowden backs Apple in fight over iPhone, calls on Google to speak up\n\nFacebook followed with more forceful language on Thursday, warning of a \"chilling precedent\" and pledging to \"fight aggressively\" against government efforts to \"weaken the security\" of consumer tech products.\n\nCEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Twitter's support, later on Thursday: \"We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFacebook, Twitter side with Apple in iPhone fight\n\nMicrosoft and Yahoo initially referred reporters to written statements from industry trade groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith tweeted a link to a trade group statement, saying \"essential to have broad public discussion on these important issues.\" Late Thursday Smith tweeted the link again and made a stronger statement: \"In a world where we need to keep both the public safe and privacy rights secure, backdoors take us backwards.\"\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYahoo backs Apple in fight over iPhone\n\nYahoo's chief information security officer Bob Lord on Friday said on Twitter: \"Ordering a company to hack one targeted system is clearly the first step to ordering them to backdoor them all. #slipperySlope#usersfirst.\" Yahoo spokeswoman Suzanne Philion confirmed the tweet reflected the official position of the Internet giant. Yahoo had previously referred reporters to statements from industry groups.\n\nStill, if the courts say Apple has to comply, there's really nothing other tech companies can do to help, said analyst Dawson. \"As far as I know, the other big tech companies have always complied in the past with similar court orders, as has Apple, and I suspect they'll continue to do so in future,\" Dawson said. \"So even if they respect Apple's stance here, it's hard for them to back it to the hilt.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn @jguynn\n\n24 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TvhnpO", "The Department of Justice has filed a motion to compel Apple to cooperate with a government investigation and help access data on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino assailants.\n\nThe motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (read it in full below) lays out the government's legal case for why Apple should provide technical assistance.\n\nIt could be viewed as a response to Apple's open letter this week stating why the company is refusing to assist -- as well as a preemptive move by the prosecutors ahead of Apple's own court filings expected next week.\n\n(Click here for our comprehensive explainer on what's going on, and here for other NPR coverage on the standoff so far.

The National Academies of Sciences sets up committees and panels of scientists all over the country, \"requesting information, white papers, townhall meetings, it's usually a two-year process of a lot of back and forth,\" said Maloney.\n\nThe rankings of projects that come out of this process are what the National Science Foundation -- or NASA or DOE -- will go by.\n\nThe NSF, and methods by which science is government funded generally, have become a target for some Republicans in Congress. Current presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz has criticized NASA's focus on earth science. Representative Lamar Smith, who serves as chair of the House committee on Science, Space and Technology has criticized projects funded by the NSF in a variety of areas.\n\nOn February 10th, the House passed a bill requiring the NSF to certify the usefulness of its grants; one of the possible criteria was economic.\n\n\"I think there's a misunderstanding between some members of congress and the research community that every grant that's given out should have some economic potential benefit,\" said Bill Andresen, associate vice president for federal relations at the University of Pennsylvania. \"And that's just not the way science works.\"\n\nNot only is some science valuable in non-economic ways, but when research does have an economic impact you can't always know it ahead of time. Studies of eagles ended up leading to advances in contact lenses, said Andrese. NSF director France Cordova points to NSF funding for digital libraries that helped lead to Google.\n\nNickolas Fotopoulos spent about seven years as a Ph.D student and post doc working on the LIGO gravitational wave project \"in data analysis on inspiraling neutron stars and black holes,\" he said.\n\nFotopoulos argues that he and scientists like him are the economic payoff of funding basic science. He now works in the private sector for a company called Synaptics, working on touch screen technology in mobile phones and laptops. \"Scientists are very good hires,\" he said, \"because they can deal with poorly defined questions.

And the company has assembled a team of employees to explore the \"future of social interaction in VR.\"\n\n\"Going back about 10 years, most of what we shared and experienced was text,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Sunday at the Mobile World Congress telecommunications industry convention in Barcelona.\n\n\"And then it was photos. And now we're entering into a world where that's video. But pretty soon we're going to live in a world where everyone has the power to share and experience whole scenes as if you're right there in person,\" he said.\n\nFacebook placed a huge bet on the future of virtual reality in 2014 when it spent $2.3 billion to buy startup Oculus VR, which next month plans to ship its first consumer-ready virtual reality viewing headsets, the widely anticipated $599 Oculus Rift.\n\nBut Facebook is trying to stay ahead of the competition. Electronics device maker HTC said Sunday the company will charge $799 for its heralded HTC Vive virtual reality system, due out in April. Meanwhile, Sony also plans to release a PlayStation VR headset this year.\n\nIn the online battle, Google's YouTube began offering 360-degree video months before Facebook.\n\nSo Zuckerberg made a surprise appearance at a Mobile World Congress press conference Sunday. He joined Samsung executives, who introduced the South Korean electronics giant's consumer-oriented virtual reality camera called the Gear 360, which the company hopes will increase the volume of user-generated virtual reality video posted online.\n\nSamsung's $100 Gear VR viewing headset is also powered by Oculus technology. Facebook said more than 200 games and apps have become available for the Gear VR since Samsung began selling the device in November.\n\nTo extend that partnership, Facebook said its \"dynamic streaming technology\" will be viewable to Gear VR owners in a few weeks.\n\nIn a blog post, Facebook said dynamic streaming will deliver 360-degree video over the Internet more efficiently, \"showing only the pixels you're actually looking at in the highest quality, instead of delivering the entire 360 video in high resolution.\"\n\nThe technology creates \"dozens of variants\" for each video, \"each tailored to a specific viewing angle, and then as you watch the video, we rapidly adjust which variant we display based on where you're looking,\" the company said.\n\nThe process quadruples the resolution quality while reducing the bandwidth required \"so videos look clearer and play faster,\" Facebook said.\n\nThe Social VR team, meanwhile, is charged with exploring how people will share virtual reality video now and in the future.", "Mei Chan and Daniel Chan are medical students at McMaster Medical School in Kitchener. They're launching The Stethoscope Series, a series of talks that are open to the community and that will tackle health myths. They wrote this column to coincide with their first talk on Monday, February 22.\n\nMore than 50 per cent of Canadian adults are overweight or obese, based on their body mass index or BMI, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nBMI is a measure used to determine body fat, based on your height and weight. If you fall within certain categories, you're determined to be underweight, average weight or overweight.\n\nWeight is on the minds of man Canadians - over two thirds have tried a diet to lose weight in the past five years, but few of those have been able to keep the weight off.\n\nA quick Google search for \"Best diet to lose weight\" returns over 40 million hits with different tips and often contradictory diet plans.\n\nThe truth is that there is no quick and easy solution.\n\nGenerally, 80 per cent of weight loss is in what you eat, and 20 per cent is due to exercise.\n\nThe key to healthy and sustainable weight loss is monitoring what you eat and ensuring that the calories being eaten are less than the calories being expended. Put simply, if we use more calories than we eat, then, we may lose weight.\n\nHere's a simple way to lose weight:\n\nYour TDEE represents the total amount of calories you burn in a 24-hour period, taking into account your height, weight, age, and daily physical activity level. You can calculate your TDEE using an online calculator. Monitoring your TDEE and caloric intake is more important than cutting any particular types of food for weight loss, which is typically what fad diets promote. That's why most people who go on diets gain back the weight they lost when they return to their former eating habits. In order to keep the pounds off, a long-term change in behaviour is often required.\n\nEach pound of weight loss is the equivalent of 3,500 calories less than your TDEE amount. In order to lose 1-2 pounds a week, a rate considered safe and sustainable, you'll need a total caloric deficit of around. 3,500 to 7,000 per week. That works out to a daily deficit of about 500 to 1000 calories. Keep in mind that women shouldn't eat below 1,200 calories per day and males shouldn't go below 1,800 calories.\n\nPrepare a diet plan based on the amount of calories calculated in step 2 by using the Canada Food Guide to determine weekly meal plans and ensure you are meeting the recommended daily allowances for each food group and obtaining sufficient nutrients. Keep in mind that one serving is often less food than we think and it's very easy to exceed our daily calorie allowance.", "PUNE, India, Feb. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- This global market research presents a detailed analysis of the key drivers, challenges, and upcoming trends that influence market growth.

Today, he spoke with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.\n\nOn the safety of self-driving cars\n\nWe actually have some studies that some private sector folks have done suggesting that the combination of autonomous and connected vehicles would potentially reduce our fatalities by 80 percent -- that is a pretty significant number when you consider we have almost 33,000 fatalities on the road every year.\n\nOn the California Department of Motor Vehicles' proposed regulations that self-driving cars would be required to have a licensed driver inside\n\nObviously, where technology is today that is definitely a good principle and of course, we would not suggest putting something unsafe on the road. That's why we have federal motor vehicle standards in the first place and by the way, our interpretation of a driver as one of these driverless systems doesn't mean that the car itself meets all of our standards. There are still some questions that have to be resolved by the technology company as to whether those vehicles meet our standards. ... I can't tell you definitively today that our view will be that having a licensed driver in the car is a requirement or should be a requirement of operating a driverless car.\n\nOn other questions the U.S. Department of Transportation is concerned about\n\nLet's think about what it takes to get a driver's license in the first place. When I came out of high school I was ready to get my driver's license and the expectation at that time was the driver would be fully engaged 100 percent of the time when he or she was operating a vehicle. In a world where the vehicle is doing more of the driving task, we are also asking questions of ourselves how we train people to drive in cars like that.\n\nOn how the government should be proactive in testing new technology\n\nUnder our old methodology, we would have waited for an auto company to come up with a driverless car and we would have had to learn the entire system at one time and that would have taken years and years and we wouldn't have been as familiar with it. The way we're doing it now, taking interpretations like ... the car being a driver under our safety standards, these interpretations are also teaching us, and so as we learn, we are going to be better and better until we are able to keep pace with innovation and I think safety will benefit as well.", "Google was told by the National Highway Traffic Administration earlier this month that the self-driving car system can be considered as a driver.\n\nSome say yes if the computer is accurate and has no bugs in it, while some say no because they want to be in control and they enjoy driving.\n\nA University of Michigan survey found that about 90 percent of Americans have some concerns about the concept of self-driving cars.

Today, he spoke with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.\n\nOn the safety of self-driving cars\n\nWe actually have some studies that some private sector folks have done suggesting that the combination of autonomous and connected vehicles would potentially reduce our fatalities by 80 percent -- that is a pretty significant number when you consider we have almost 33,000 fatalities on the road every year.\n\nOn the California Department of Motor Vehicles' proposed regulations that self-driving cars would be required to have a licensed driver inside\n\nObviously, where technology is today that is definitely a good principle and of course, we would not suggest putting something unsafe on the road. That's why we have federal motor vehicle standards in the first place and by the way, our interpretation of a driver as one of these driverless systems doesn't mean that the car itself meets all of our standards. There are still some questions that have to be resolved by the technology company as to whether those vehicles meet our standards. ... I can't tell you definitively today that our view will be that having a licensed driver in the car is a requirement or should be a requirement of operating a driverless car.\n\nOn other questions the U.S. Department of Transportation is concerned about\n\nLet's think about what it takes to get a driver's license in the first place. When I came out of high school I was ready to get my driver's license and the expectation at that time was the driver would be fully engaged 100 percent of the time when he or she was operating a vehicle. In a world where the vehicle is doing more of the driving task, we are also asking questions of ourselves how we train people to drive in cars like that.\n\nOn how the government should be proactive in testing new technology\n\nUnder our old methodology, we would have waited for an auto company to come up with a driverless car and we would have had to learn the entire system at one time and that would have taken years and years and we wouldn't have been as familiar with it. The way we're doing it now, taking interpretations like ... the car being a driver under our safety standards, these interpretations are also teaching us, and so as we learn, we are going to be better and better until we are able to keep pace with innovation and I think safety will benefit as well.", "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg likes to boast that his 3-year-old effort to bring the developing world online has reached millions of people in some of the world's poorest nations.\n\nBut a central element of his Internet.org campaign was controversial even before it was shut down in a key market this month. Indian regulators banned one of the pillars of the campaign, a service known as Free Basics, because it provided access only to certain pre-approved services -- including Facebook -- rather than the full Internet.\n\nThat leaves the social media mogul at a crossroads. Though he has vowed not to give up, Zuckerberg hasn't said whether he'll alter his approach. Facebook declined to make executives available for comment. Zuckerberg could shed light on his plans when he speaks Monday at Mobile World Congress, an annual industry event in Barcelona, Spain, where he has touted Internet.org in previous years.\n\n\"Everyone in the world should have access to the Internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook this month, arguing that online connections can improve lives and fuel economic development.\n\nTo achieve that goal, Zuckerberg has high-flying dreams for someday providing Internet connections through a network of drones, satellites and lasers. But his near-term plan is simpler: Facebook works with wireless carriers in poorer nations to let people use streamlined versions of Facebook and certain other online services, without paying data charges.\n\nWhile the drones may someday connect people in areas too remote for cables or cell towers, Free Basics is intended for people who live in areas with Internet service but still can't afford it.\n\nA low-income resident of urban Manila, for example, can use Free Basics to view the Philippines' GMA News site. \"He can be informed. He can research. He can read the news,\" Ederic Eder of GMA News said.\n\nThe program varies by country, in offerings and effectiveness.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, Facebook partnered with the third-largest wireless carrier, Cell C. But Johannesburg resident Priscilla de Klerk said she couldn't get Free Basics to work on her phone. \"Cell C is much cheaper as far as everything else is concerned, but their free Facebook is not a reality,\" she said.\n\nLast fall, Facebook announced a major expansion in Africa, where another regional carrier, Bharti Airtel, said it will offer Free Basics in 17 countries.\n\n\"They're getting a lot of traction in Africa,\" said Danson Njue, a Kenya-based telecom analyst with the Ovum research firm. Tech rivals Google and Microsoft also have programs to expand Internet access, he noted, but their approaches are content neutral and involve extending networks to underserved areas.\n\nFacebook doesn't pay wireless companies for the cost of Free Basics. Carriers make money if new users eventually move to a paid data plan. Facebook also says it makes no money, as it doesn't show ads, though Zuckerberg has conceded it benefits from gaining users in the long run. While the company hasn't released detailed usage figures, Facebook says Free Basics has brought more than 19 million people online for the first time. That counts any user who didn't have Internet access before, regardless of whether they're currently active.\n\nOn the Internet.org website, mixed in with videos about impoverished students using Free Basics to study and laborers starting small businesses, Facebook boasts more than 1 billion people \"have access\" to the service. That's the combined population of regions where it's available, not the number of users.\n\nFree Basics is now in 36 countries. It was suspended last year in Egypt, on the anniversary of anti-government protests that were organized partly on Facebook. An earlier version of Free Basics, known as Facebook Zero, was shuttered three years ago in Chile, after authorities said Internet providers couldn't offer discounts for accessing some content but not others.\n\nSimilar concerns turned India into the program's biggest battleground.\n\nFree Basics enrolled more than 1 million Indians in its first year, according to Facebook's wireless partner, Reliance Communications. But critics, including many in the country's growing tech community, complained it was a predatory scheme: If low-income users couldn't afford anything besides Free Basics, opponents said, that meant Facebook was deciding which online services the nation's poor could use.\n\n\"The government should not allow big players to monopolize the Internet,\" said Manu Sharma, who runs a software development company in New Delhi.\n\nFacebook responded last fall by announcing it would open Free Basics to any app that met its technical requirements for systems with limited capacity. Zuckerberg also changed the program's name to Free Basics, after critics complained \"Internet.org\" sounded like a nonprofit, when it's part of a for-profit company (the overall campaign is still called Internet.org).\n\nBut opponents still worry that Facebook could change requirements at any time, force competitors to pay higher rates to get into the program, or even block services that run afoul of powerful politicians.\n\n\"The fact that it could decide what apps could be hosted ... was a huge problem for me,\" said Basit Zaidi, a New Delhi attorney.\n\nAs Indian regulators began studying the issue, Facebook drew more resentment with a public-relations blitz that critics called heavy-handed and patronizing. The regulators effectively banned Free Basics after concluding Internet providers shouldn't be allowed to charge different rates for certain services, because that discriminates against other content.\n\nUS regulators have endorsed the concept of \"net neutrality,\" which says all websites and apps should be treated equally by Internet providers. They're now studying whether \"zero rating\" programs, which offer some content for free, should be allowed. Net neutrality supporters are hoping India's decision will influence other nations.\n\nFacebook has also launched a program that helps Internet providers offer reliable Wi-Fi service in underserved areas at affordable rates and without limits on content. The program's been limited to tests in a few countries.\n\nThe giant tech company could use its resources and clout with carriers to offer a similar wireless service, perhaps at limited speeds or volume, but without any restrictions on content, said Josh Levy of Access Now, a nonprofit that supports net neutrality. Zuckerberg has suggested in the past that such a service would be too expensive and difficult to offer.\n\nSome Indians, meanwhile, say their country could have benefited from Free Basics.\n\n\"Ultimately, something is better than nothing, even if that something is flawed,\" said Uday Singh Tomar, a software engineer in New Delhi. \"If a person is hungry and getting nothing, a free meal is good enough.\"", "Apple's resistance to the FBI's request for an iPhone hacking tool can be hard to evaluate because the dispute is taking place on three levels: technical, legal, and policy. None of these is necessarily more important than any other, and focusing on just one or two presents a skewed view of what's going on.\n\nOn the technical level, we now know that Apple could do what the FBI wants, but the company is tremendously worried that any such technology would escape into the wild. It's one thing to create a digital tool, but an entirely different thing to prevent it from being stolen, subverted, or simply copied. Since this tool could subvert the otherwise unbreakable (as least as far as is known) encryption embedded in the iPhone's Secure Enclave coprocessor, its creation would undermine the privacy of millions of iPhone users.\n\nBecause there's no actual law requiring Apple to comply or, conversely, protecting Apple from such requests, the FBI is relying on the All Writs Act of 1789. That Act has been used in similar surveillance-related cases in the past, but it's inherently vague, which means that lawyers and judges could wrangle about the specifics for a long time.\n\nWhen it comes to policy, it seems clear that the FBI is using this high-profile case of domestic terrorism as an opportunity to further its real goal, which is to be able to gain lawful access to evidence from any smartphone or digital device. And while Apple denies that it's resisting for marketing reasons, given that Apple is a for-profit business, it's impossible to know how much of its stance stems from being the right thing to do versus being a competitive advantage or marketing point.\n\nI'm coming down on Apple's side because I don't believe the FBI understands the technology well enough to appreciate Apple's argument about the impossibility of keeping a digital genie bottled up. I also don't see weakening iPhone security as a long-term win, given that it's far too easy for any interested organization to create, distribute, and use unbreakable encryption software. While I can't claim sufficient experience to comment on the legal issues, I dislike the way the FBI is using this case to push its agenda, and while Apple sometimes employs its commitment to privacy in ways that aren't entirely fair to competitors, that's a far lesser sin.\n\nWith all that said, here are the ExtraBITS we've published since my original coverage. They paint a fuller picture of what's happening and are well worth reading if you're interested in this case.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft CEOs Back Apple -- Twitter doesn't lend itself to subtlety or nuance, but Google CEO Sundar Pichai used a 5-part tweet to weigh in on Apple CEO Tim Cook's open letter to customers about the FBI's request that Apple create a hacking tool to brute force an iPhone passcode in the San Bernardino terrorism case. Pichai essentially signed on to Apple's position, saying that Google builds secure products and complies with legal orders to hand over data when possible, but simultaneously expressing concern that requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data could be a troubling precedent. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also commented, though less directly, by retweeting a post from Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith that summarized the firm's anti-backdoor position via a linked statement from the Reform Government Surveillance group, of which Microsoft is a member.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nTim Cook's Open Letter Prompted by the FBI Going Public -- Apple's spat with the FBI over building a cracking tool for an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino terrorism case has taken an interesting turn. The New York Times reports that while Apple had asked the FBI to file its request under seal, the government chose instead to make it public. That supports the theory that the FBI is using this high-profile case of domestic terrorism to pressure Apple into compromising the security of its products. Faced with this PR onslaught, Apple saw no choice but to take its case for supporting encryption to the public in Tim Cook's open letter. Sadly, this fight between the FBI and Apple could have been avoided had the assailant's employer used standard mobile device management tools to maintain passcode control over the work iPhone in question.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nA Forensics Expert's View into the FBI's Request -- The more we learn about the Apple/FBI dustup, the more clear it has become that this is actually a subtle and dangerous game of chess. The latest insight comes from Jonathan Zdziarski, considered to be among the world's leading experts in iOS-related forensics. In a blog post, Zdziarski explains the difference between \"lab services\" and developing an \"instrument.\" Apple has provided one-off lab services in the past to help law enforcement recover data when required by law. But developing an instrument is a tremendously involved, verified, documented, tested, and validated process. It would require significant resources and would result in the hacking tool being made public and usable by any law enforcement or intelligence agency -- along with foreign governments and criminal organizations. That's why Apple is resisting.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nDetails Emerge in Dispute between Apple and FBI -- In a call with reporters, as covered by TechCrunch, Apple executives clarified a couple of points in the ongoing dispute between the company and the FBI. First, any tool that met the FBI's desire for software that would enable the brute force cracking of an iPhone's passcode would also work on newer iPhones with iOS 8 or iOS 9 and a Secure Enclave coprocessor. That's because the data in the Secure Enclave is encrypted by the passcode, which provides access to everything on an iPhone. Second, the FBI apparently reset the Apple ID password for the account associated with the iPhone right after taking the iPhone into custody. That prevented any further automatic iCloud backups, which Apple could have turned over to the government.\n\nRead/post comments\n\nApple Answers More Questions about FBI Court Order -- As speculation swirls about the implications of Apple resisting the FBI's request for help accessing an iPhone used by one of the assailants in the San Bernardino terrorism case, the company has posted another public statement answering some of the questions that have arisen. In particular, Apple explains why it objects to the government's court order, whether or not the FBI's request is technically feasible, why such a technical solution could not be contained, and more. One particular note -- despite what has appeared in the media, Apple says it has never previously unlocked iPhones. Prior to iOS 8, Apple had extracted unencrypted data from locked iPhones for law enforcement, using a technique that didn't require them to be unlocked. The encryption in iOS 8 and iOS 9 makes that impossible now.", "By Eric Auchard\n\nBARCELONA (Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Monday tried to extend an olive branch to mobile phone companies, on which the popular social network company increasingly relies, but which are also among his biggest critics.\n\nSpeaking for the third straight year to an annual gathering of telecoms executives at the Mobile World Congress here, Zuckerberg sought to show his company could be a valuable, if truculent, ally to the wireless industry.\n\nHe described a new project Facebook is working on with major telecom players, including Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, SK Telecom and Intel to help rapidly build far faster mobile networks at lower costs.\n\nBut while listing the various ways Facebook was prepared to help network operators contend with spiraling consumer appetites for data, he also criticized and made more demands on the industry.\n\nZuckerberg challenged the priorities for next-generation 5G networks, which the industry is gearing up to deliver around 2020. He called them \"faster connections for rich people\" and said the companies should make more effort to \"finish the job of making sure that everyone in the world gets Internet access.\"\n\nMore than 4 billion people have no access to the Internet, he noted.\n\nTelecom operators complain that companies like Facebook and Google Inc that offer data-heavy mobile services are effectively free-loading on the big investments they must make to keep fixed-line and mobile networks from becoming overloaded.\n\n\"Facebook has always had a love-hate relationship with carriers,\" Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson said after Zuckerberg's comments. Further complicating his relationships with the telecom industry, Zuckerberg said video would be the next big driver for Facebook growth, putting more pressure on existing networks. Its users watch more than 100 million hours of video daily.\n\nWhile criticizing the industry for failing to do more to reach unconnected populations, Zuckerberg is a leading proponent of new virtual reality cameras that he said could be a killer app for 5G but which would place vast new demands on networks.\n\nHe also defended Facebook's Free Basics program, through which the company works with operators in emerging markets to offer a pared-back free Internet service to reach consumers who cannot afford data plans.\n\nThe Indian government introduced rules blocking Internet services from having different pricing policies for accessing different parts of the web, effectively shuttering the Free Basics program in that country, one of Facebook's most important emerging markets.\n\nZuckerberg is kicking off a tour of Europe on Monday that includes a town hall meeting in Berlin on Thursday.\n\nFacebook has faced criticism in Germany in recent months from politicians and regulators over its privacy practices and a slow response to anti-immigrant postings by neo-Nazi sympathizers on the popular social network.\n\n(Additional reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb in San Francisco; Editing by Dan Grebler)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nFacebook s Zuckerberg both woos and lashes out at phone industry - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "Dan Kaminsky is an expert on DNS security - and he's saying: Patch right God damn now\n\nBig Blue has used its IBM InterConnect conference in Las Vegas to announce cooperative deals with Apple, VMware and GitHub, as the venerable commuting giant seeks to suck in more cloudy business.\n\n\"Businesses are adopting cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation, but they are still struggling to combine those cloud native services with existing apps and data which reside on-premises,\" said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM Cloud Application Services.\n\n\"Our objective is to drastically simplify how developers discover and connect disparate apps and services, so enterprises can unlock the value of their existing IT and more rapidly capture the value of the cloud. This helps enable developers to discover and re-use the best capabilities, wherever they reside.\"\n\nOn the Swift side, IBM is expanding the Swift Sandbox announced in December to help coders use Apple's open source programming language in cloud instances.\n\nThey can also share and develop their designs in a new Swift Package Catalog that IBM will host, or write for Bluemix, IBM's platform-as-a-service system and run them in OS X and Linux on a new open source web server dubbed Kitura.\n\n\"Modern digital apps require a modern programming language. Swift is easy to learn, reliable, fast and interactive, the key traits that CIOs look for when building the next generation of enterprise mobile apps,\" said Michael Gilfix, VP of IBM MobileFirst Offering Management.\n\n\"Swift on the Cloud is an opportunity for enterprises to radically simplify the development of end-to-end applications and therefore reach new levels of productivity.\"\n\nIt's not just Apple feeling the love - there's a new deal with VMware that will bring the firm's software-defined data center architecture to IBM's cloud systems, along with the virty firm's vRealize Automation and vCenter management tools.\n\n\"This partnership, an extension of our 14-year-plus relationship with IBM, demonstrates a shared vision that will help enterprise customers more quickly and easily embrace the hybrid cloud,\" said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VMware.\n\n\"Our customers will be able to efficiently and securely deploy their proven software-defined solutions with sophisticated workload automation to take advantage of the flexibility and cost effectiveness of IBM Cloud.\"\n\nThe two firms are also going to partner up on selling hybrid cloud services to enterprise buyers and will add VMware's vSphere, NSX and Virtual SAN to Big Blue's 45 worldwide data centers. These won't be on a pay-as-you-go tariff, but instead on a monthly-based consumption pricing system.\n\nTeaming with IBM goes some way to explaining why VMware last month pulled the pin on its ambition to build a cloud capable of rivalling Big Blue's, or those of AWS, Google and Microsoft. IBM will give VMware scale and reach it could not afford to build, and therefore adds credibility to its hybrid cloud strategy.\n\nBut the tie-up will also raise eyebrows among the other, smaller, cloud operators VMware has courted as providers of hosted Virtzilla environments. Those outfits now have the biggest of big competitors, which has been handed a privileged position by their supplier/partner.\n\nThe deal's also curious in light of VMware's previous cloud strategy to pipe in services from other clouds. That plan started with Google storage services but has not, as expected, seen VMware pipe in services from other clouds as the company's one-time cloud Czar Bill Fathers promised us last year.\n\nGitHub too is getting into bed with Big Blue, with the code repository's pricey Enterprise offering now being hosted on IBM's Bluemix as a dedicated service for hybrid and private cloud users. As a bonus, IBM's security scanning engine will check customers' code for obvious flaws.\n\n\"Great software is no longer a nice-to-have in the enterprise, and developers expect to be able to build software quickly and collaboratively,\" said Chris Wanstrath, CEO of GitHub.\n\n\"By making GitHub Enterprise available on the IBM Cloud, even more companies will be able to tap into the power of social coding, and build the best software, faster.\" \u00ae", "Politicos agree on almost nothing these days, but one thing they could find common ground on is that blowing up, shooting, dismembering and stabbing animals -- often called \"live tissue training\" -- is a stupid and wasteful way to attempt to train our troops to save lives on the battlefield.\n\nYes, this still happens. But a bipartisan bill, the Battlefield Excellence through Superior Training Practices Act, would address this abominable practice.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of our military allies no longer do this. Virtually every hospital and medical school across the U.S. has switched to realistic human patient simulators, virtual reality and other 21st century technologies to train doctors to treat gunshot wounds and other traumatic injuries. Not surprisingly, study after study indicates human patient simulation is more effective than mutilating goats and pigs for teaching emergency medical skills.\n\nYet, rather than modernize their programs, some areas of the U.S. military have attempted to \"firewall\" -- their words -- themselves from criticism for continuing this unnecessary animal use by pushing it off military bases and relegating it to remote sites, where it's led by training contractors with records of rampant abuse and virtually no oversight.\n\nIn the past year alone, some of the leading contractors that offer this training for the Pentagon have been exposed for drugging, experimenting on and sexually abusing soldiers; fraud; violently mutilating animals; and flouting other laws and policies. It was even revealed this past summer that the Georgia National Guard contracted the University of Georgia to lead a medical training course that involved cutting into the throats and abdomens of beagle dogs -- even though the use of dogs and cats for this kind of training has been banned by the Pentagon since 1983.\n\nJust Google and you'll see video of a recent course in which pigs were dragged out into the woods, shot in the face and limbs, and repeatedly stabbed to cause massive bleeding. One live pig had its chest carved open and ribs cracked for an exercise during which participants quipped about the TV show \"Dexter\" and joked that the pig must've been a \"nonsmoker\" as they cut off and passed around pieces of its lungs and heart. In footage from another course, instructors cheerfully whistled while participants cut off live goats' limbs with tree trimmers and joked that they should be writing songs about it.\n\nAbuses by the companies the military hires for this archaic training have become such a problem that the U.S. Marine Corps emphatically wrote in an updated training guide, \"Make sure your units comply with USMC policy and use only approved vendors, and check on their programs to make sure they aren't doing something illegal, unethical, or immoral, or just plain wrong!\"\n\nThis training also abuses Americans' wallets. Don't take my word for it. Air Force researchers recently noted, \"Artificial simulators can be low cost when considering the cost of veterinary personnel and support facilities required for animal training.\"\n\nThe standard predeployment medical training course costs about $500 per troop when taught with human simulators, or $2,000 per troop using one of these ridiculous animal laboratories. This translates into millions in waste each year. Contractors are fleecing taxpayers by charging the government $2,000 for a pig.\n\nThis reckless spending is on top of the more than $20 million the Pentagon has recently spent on studies to confirm what I could have told them for free: Tearing apart goats and pigs isn't the best way to train service members how to manage injuries in human beings.\n\nFor God's sake, our troops deserve at least as good a medical training experience as kids at Georgetown or Yale; let's stop slighting the bravest among us by giving them swine instead of soldier simulators.", "SEATTLE - Amazon.com has reclaimed the top spot as America's most-loved company in an annual ranking of some of the country's largest companies.\n\nMarket research firm Harris Poll recently released its 17th annual ranking of the public's perceptions of the 100 most visible companies in the U.S.\n\nDespite news reports over the years about Amazon's tough - some say brutal - working conditions, the Seattle-based online retailer ranked in the top 10 for the eighth consecutive year and even scored highly for the reputation of its workplace conditions.\n\nLast year, Amazon was No. 2 on the list behind Wegmans Food Markets, while Costco was No. 4. The online retailer was No. 1 in 2014 and 2013.\n\nTwo other Pacific Northwest companies joined Amazon in the Top 20 this year, with Costco coming in at No. 13 and Microsoft at No. 20.\n\nNordstrom came in 37th, Starbucks 62nd and T-Mobile 73rd.\n\nAt the very bottom? Scandal-plagued Volkswagen Group.\n\nHarris Poll, owned by Nielsen, surveyed more than 23,000 people to get their perceptions of companies' reputations in the six areas of social responsibility, emotional appeal, products and services, vision and leadership, financial performance, and workplace environment.\n\nAmazon, along with Google (No. 3 on the list, behind Amazon and Apple), ranked among the top five in all six reputational areas, according to the Harris Poll's summary report of the findings. The online retailer showed particular strength in its product offerings and emotional connection with customers. It ranked fifth in workplace environment.\n\nStarbucks dropped in the rankings from No. 31 last year to No. 62 this year. The company experienced declines in all six reputational areas, notably vision and leadership, social responsibility, and financial performance, according to Harris Poll spokeswoman Jennifer Frighetto.\n\nAffecting the social responsibility rating decline is that, last year, the study measured the impact of Starbucks' announcement to offer free college tuition to its baristas. \"This year is likely leveling out after that news,\" Frighetto said.", "It's popular history at this point, but back in the early 1970s Seattle was the Detroit of today. A dying city increasingly bereft of the manufacturing jobs that once animated its economy, a billboard was eventually put up near the city's airport asking the last one leaving to turn out the lights.\n\nBut then two Seattle natives returned. Having started what was then called Micro-Soft in Albuquerque, Bill Gates and Paul Allen brought their creation back to the Emerald City. A place that had been given up for dead was soon enough one of the most economically advanced cities in the United States. Once a talent-repellent, Seattle became a magnet for the commercially creative (think Jeff Bezos, Amazon) along with those who were testing new ideas musically (Nirvana, Pearl Jam). Genius is a lure for genius.\n\nIt was Seattle's transformation by two individuals, what Canadian economist Reuven Brenner refers to as the \"vital few,\" that had me very excited to read Eric Weiner's new book, The Geography of Genius. The expectation was that he would tell exciting stories somewhat like the one that took place in a once-depressed Seattle. Unfortunately, Weiner's history disappoints. Maybe it was all about incorrect expectations, but a book full of anecdotes, uncritical thinking, and vague conclusions left me limp. In possession of a great idea, Weiner's collection of thoughts doesn't quite measure up to his presumed goal: explaining the why behind human flourishing in cities and locales such as Athens, Vienna, and Silicon Valley.\n\nWeiner is no doubt correct that we modernly suffer \"from a serious case of genius inflation.\" Seemingly so many nowadays are brilliant, iconic, and all sorts of other admiring adjectives. Weiner's own definition of \"genius\" is \"in the creative sense - as the highest form of creativity,\" or someone \"who makes an intellectual or artistic leap.\" Seemingly Gates, Allen and Bezos would qualify considering the commercial advances they oversaw, but Weiner wasn't exactly eager to give the achievers of the technological variety their due.\n\nPresumably one of Weiner's reasons for not applying genius to Silicon Valley is revealed in his chapter on Athens. While very appreciative of the Greeks (Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, etc.), Weiner notes that Athens' thinkers in a broad sense were \"tremendous moochers\" who \"stole\" ideas. But this is a popular modern mode of thought that Weiner could have easily dismissed through a careful analysis of Silicon Valley itself. Gates and Steve Jobs were said to have \"stolen\" ideas from Xerox long ago. But could he or most anyone in his high-demographic orbit walk into Google's R&D department or Amazon's Lab126 and \"steal\" ideas? Odds are that only a microscopic fraction of a fraction of the world's population would have a clue about what to take from the labs of technology companies, let alone what to do with those ideas once lifted. All that, plus let's not forget that the technology world's story is one built on near constant failure. To \"mooch\" ideas would be for even the brightest of technological minds to take ideas set to implode once put into operation. Was it any different thousands of years ago? Of course, in a book that was seemingly arguing with itself the majority of the time, later on Weiner acknowledges that great thinkers tend to \"stand on the shoulders\" of giant thinkers who came before them; mooching in a sense. If you don't like one of Weiner's conclusions, fear not, he'll conclude the opposite soon enough.\n\nOne of Weiner's odd contentions about the source of Athens' genius was that everyone was equal. There were no stars as it were, hence Weiner's assertion that \"Should a Silicon Valley technokind suddenly materialize in ancient Athens, he would be treated like any other craftsman, with a puny salary, no recognition, and, when his back was turned, a derisive sneer.\" A snippy statement for sure, but then as evidenced by Weiner's research that revealed Socrates et al as heroic, there quite simply was grand recognition for Athens' best thinkers. Furthermore, we're talking about a highly primitive commercial economy when we discuss ancient Greece. What would a large salary have won for even the wealthiest so long ago?\n\nMost incomplete of all about the Athens chapter is Weiner's almost vague reference to the happy truth that ancient Athens \"embraced not only foreign goods and ideas. It also welcomed foreigners themselves.\" These guest workers, \"resident aliens,\" or \"metics\" (in Greek lingo) were free to live and work there as books by Alfred Zimmern (The Greek Commonwealth) and Will Durant (The Life of Greece) have made plain. It's fair to say that this was the big story of Athens' genius. Not a race, the city-state was a collection of talented people from all over in pursuit of the freedom to flourish. That's not the case today. As Weiner writes, modern Greece \"has extremely tight border controls. It doesn't take kindly to interlopers such as me.\" Simply stated, locales open to outsiders regardless of race or religion (think Amsterdam in the 17th century) have a tendency to prosper thanks to the influx of great minds in search of opportunity. Weiner gets that wealth and freedom matter, but spends much of the chapter not providing any powerful reasons for the renaissance in Athens. It was arguably staring him in the face.\n\nAlways asking why certain places flourished, Weiner rarely provides concrete answers. One possibility for why has to do with his frequent elevation of nurture (culture) combined with a dismissal of nature (genes) when trying to explain genius. Armed with a backwards conclusion at the outset, the author wasn't ever able to recover on the way to providing an interesting history. Mainly he offered platitudes along the lines of \"If it takes a village to raise a child, as the African proverb goes, it takes a city to raise a genius.\" Apparently Einstein, Bezos and Jobs would have been sub-genius if they'd grown up in Pine Bluff, AR.\n\nYet if he wanted an explanation for genius being driven to some degree by environmental factors, China's Hangzhou (one of the world's most advanced cities - wealth, sanitation, education, literacy - in the 13th century) might have been an interesting place to make such a case simply because of its broad openness to trade. There \"you could buy anything; rhinoceros horns from India, ivory from Africa...\" The beauty of free trade is that the individuals who comprise an economy can do the work that most matches their skills, only to exchange the fruits of their labor for the goods they're least capable of producing. Open trade is easily the best way to mitigate a lack of talent for it allowing individuals to focus on what amplifies their talents. Trade is the biggest exposer of genius, while closed borders to goods are most liable to obscure same. Would we have ever heard of Plato, Michelangelo and Jobs if the need to merely survive had forced them into farm work? But Weiner didn't spend much time on the possible relationship between Hangzhou's genius and its openness to the world's plenty, and how it magnified the skills of those within the city.\n\nInstead, he made declarative statements that can't be proven, and that are arguably untrue as is. One of those was that \"creative people clearly derive inspiration from nature,\" only to cite New York City's Central Park as an example. Really? Did the world's most interesting and talented reach New York a little bit dull only to have their creative juices boosted by Strawberry Fields? Earlier in the book he draws an alleged link between walking and creativity. This will surely interest a large moviemaking population based in Los Angeles where driving is generally the rule.\n\nWeiner attributes an apparent lack of modern Chinese creativity (little mention is given to Mao's murderous regime in which tens of millions were exterminated as a possible reason for it being in catch-up mode) to a culture that doesn't prize individuality. He cites a Chinese expression which says \"The first bird to fly is the one who gets shot,\" but in a book that regularly contradicts itself, in the very same chapter he mentions an interview with Hangzhou's own Jack Ma, the rather creative founder of Alibaba. His meeting with Ma naturally piqued this reviewer's interest, only for Weiner to not spend much time on him.\n\nInstead, Weiner substituted his own thoughts for Ma's. As he sees it, maybe China's creativity is simply very deliberate compared to U.S. creativity that he deems somewhat hyped. As he puts it, American creativity is really more of a marketing concept whereby stodgy U.S. corporations make \"even the most minor tweaks appear revolutionary.\" It's a nice thought, but wholly untrue. If it were all about marketing, then it's certainly true that advertising and PR would be the last to feel U.S. downturns, when in fact it's well known that they're always the first. After that, and if it's all about hype, what's Weiner's explanation for the failed launches of Amazon's mobile phone, Microsoft's Zune, Ford's Edsel, and Coca-Cola's \"New Coke\"?\n\nIn his discussion of Florence, the contradictions and odd assertions really pick up steam. While Weiner acknowledges the importance of wealthy patrons (lest we forget, Silicon Valley's early VC money was largely inherited wealth of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, and Phipps variety), he asserts that absent a Medici (a very rich banking family that prospered amid Florence's renaissance that it funded) randomly noticing and correcting an obvious mistake on a piece of art crafted by Michelangelo, \"we would not know the name Michelangelo.\" Yet in the very next paragraph Weiner asserts that \"What we do know is that the geniuses of Florence did not appear by accident.\"\n\nAbout the act of taking risks in once thriving Florence, on p. 135 Weiner quotes an interviewee who told him \"you could starve to death if you failed,\" and that there was no bankruptcy to fall back on. Failure back then could destroy \"your family for generations.\" But three pages later he writes that the basis of the city's genius backed by wealthy patrons was that \"wealth gives you the chance to fail. Wealth gives you do-overs.\"\n\nWhen he wasn't contradicting himself, Weiner was plain wrong. Describing the ways modern participants in commerce do things today, he writes that \"We treat risk not as a noble venture, a dance with the universe, but as something to be avoided at all costs, or at least reduced to a decimal point.\" This bit of absurdity might this time interest venture capitalists in Silicon Valley who invest in countless failures in the hope that just one start-up success erases all the other proverbial dry holes.\n\nMaybe most frustrating of all was how uncritical Weiner's analysis of seemingly everything was. At one point he cites a poll of Nobel Laureates who attributed their success to great \"mentors,\" and then later on in the book another poll in which another set of Nobels tied their achievement to \"being in the right place at the right time.\" So that's all it is? Implicit in his worldview is that we really are just a bunch of blank slates waiting to be molded in the right place? No heredity? Maybe, maybe not. Just turn the page and you'll find a different answer. Indeed, at one point Weiner acknowledges that \"the vast majority of geniuses have come from the middle and upper middle classes.\" Were these individuals blank slates too, or is it possible that smart, successful people tend to have smart kids? Considering China's beautiful rise from murderous destitution, a look at Shanghai in 1978 versus today would strike some as \"genius.\" What in the country's once tragic environment molded this brilliant transformation?\n\nPerhaps most horrid of all is Weiner's contention that the Black Death that killed off many Florence inhabitants had a positive side effect for the devastating plague helping to author the city's eventual renaissance. He adds that Athens' golden age would not \"have happened had the Persians not first sacked Athens, burning it to the ground, and clearing the way for Pericles''s ambitious rebuilding.\" Oh yes, we've heard something like this before. Supposedly all the killing during World War II saved the U.S. economy. A more absurd, dangerous and sickening point-of-view would be hard to find, but Weiner promotes it. Applied to Florence, supposedly all the dying freed up inheritances to fund intellectual advancement. No mention of all the wealth and advances that never saw the light of day thanks to so many lives ending prematurely. The life that is the tautological basis for genius apparently needs to be snuffed out for genius to reveal itself... With the U.S. economy presently a bit weak, maybe we ought to dynamite a few American cities to revive them, and maybe find a few more wars to fight so that more of our best and brightest can be maimed and murdered. Let's do it to promote \"genius.\"\n\nDespite analysis that left a great deal to be desired, Weiner occasionally makes it fun for the reader. Describing the chaos that is Calcutta (it had a minor renaissance from 1840-1920), he talks about the struggling city's \"lovable ugliness.\" It's also revealed that Beethoven (Vienna) was an amazing slob, yet in his chapters on Vienna he never sees fit to feature Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek despite their profound influence to this day on economic thought. Though he mentions \"disruption\" a few times in the book, another individual who thrived in Vienna (Joseph Schumpeter) similarly rates no mention.\n\nThe Austrian School economists listed were all academics, so this may explain why he didn't talk about them? In his chapter on Florence, Weiner correctly pointed out that education isn't as important as some assume. Figure Florence's flowering took place despite it not having a \"decent university.\" Yet even there he contradicts himself. Desperate in his belief that geniuses aren't born as much as they're created, it was surprising that he would acknowledge how little education matters. That it doesn't supports the nature point of view, but Weiner says \"we know [genius] is not genetic.\"\n\nWeiner concludes with a chapter on Silicon Valley only to strangely offer an either/or as to whether its innovations qualify as genius. Worse, in trying to explain its prosperity he brought up banal theories such as the Valley might have a chip on its shoulder rooted in early east coast disdain for Stanford. He also cited \"buckets of government money\" as a source of its economic vitality without talking about why those same buckets of taxpayer funds didn't eventuate a similar boom in West Virginia. What about southern California? It too was the alleged beneficiary of heavy government spending, it has prominent universities popular with the technology focused like Caltech, but no one's mistaking Pasadena's economy for Palo Alto's.\n\nWhat's most difficult to wrap one's hands around is Weiner's persistent contention that genes aren't terribly relevant as the source of intelligence. In discussing Vienna, he does, however, write that while \"Jews constituted only 10 percent of Vienna's population, they accounted for more than half of its doctors and lawyers, and nearly two-thirds of its journalists, as well as a disproportionately high number of the city's creative geniuses.\" Writing in Commentary back in 2007, Charles Murray noted that despite Jewish people only comprising two-tenths of one percent of the world's population, individuals of Jewish descent claimed 29 percent of the Nobel Prizes awarded during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nWhat the above stats tell us fairly clearly is that Weiner's dismissal of genes in his attempt to explain genius amounts to willful blindness. If it were truly all about culture, then parents the world over would spend years observing the Jewish culture before having kids. Some would beg Jewish families to adopt their kids. Can Weiner really be so dismissive of statistics unearthed not just by Murray, but from his own studies? Apparently so.\n\nUnfortunately, the evidence-free dismissal of genes is but one of many reasons why it's hard to recommend The Geography of Genius. Weiner is a talented writer, but he let his deeply held views get in the way of actually finding answers to the why behind genius, and why smart people cluster. At one point he happened on the best answer (\"Great minds don't necessarily think alike, but they do gravitate to one another\") to the latter only to quickly move on to anecdotes and \"aha\" discoveries that could only impress those closest to him. Very disappointing in light of the excitement that came with ordering Weiner's book is that the best and most alluring part of The Geography of Genius is its title.", "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Monday tried to extend an olive branch to mobile phone companies, on which the popular social network company increasingly relies, but which are also among his biggest critics.\n\nSpeaking for the third straight year to an annual gathering of telecoms executives at the Mobile World Congress here, Zuckerberg sought to show his company could be a valuable, if truculent, ally to the wireless industry.\n\nHe described a new project Facebook is working on with major telecom players, including Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, SK Telecom and Intel to help rapidly build far faster mobile networks at lower costs.\n\nBut while listing the various ways Facebook was prepared to help network operators contend with spiraling consumer appetites for data, he also criticized and made more demands on the industry.\n\nZuckerberg challenged the priorities for next-generation 5G networks, which the industry is gearing up to deliver around 2020. He called them \"faster connections for rich people\" and said the companies should make more effort to \"finish the job of making sure that everyone in the world gets Internet access.\"\n\nMore than 4 billion people have no access to the Internet, he noted.\n\nTelecom operators complain that companies like Facebook and Google Inc that offer data-heavy mobile services are effectively free-loading on the big investments they must make to keep fixed-line and mobile networks from becoming overloaded.\n\n\"Facebook has always had a love-hate relationship with carriers,\" Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson said after Zuckerberg's comments. Further complicating his relationships with the telecom industry, Zuckerberg said video would be the next big driver for Facebook growth, putting more pressure on existing networks. Its users watch more than 100 million hours of video daily.\n\nWhile criticizing the industry for failing to do more to reach unconnected populations, Zuckerberg is a leading proponent of new virtual reality cameras that he said could be a killer app for 5G but which would place vast new demands on networks.\n\nHe also defended Facebook's Free Basics program, through which the company works with operators in emerging markets to offer a pared-back free Internet service to reach consumers who cannot afford data plans.\n\nThe Indian government introduced rules blocking Internet services from having different pricing policies for accessing different parts of the web, effectively shuttering the Free Basics program in that country, one of Facebook's most important emerging markets.\n\nZuckerberg is kicking off a tour of Europe on Monday that includes a town hall meeting in Berlin on Thursday.\n\nFacebook has faced criticism in Germany in recent months from politicians and regulators over its privacy practices and a slow response to anti-immigrant postings by neo-Nazi sympathizers on the popular social network.\n\n(Additional reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb in San Francisco; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "Hardware manufacturer Nvidia has updated its Shield Android TV system software, putting the platform ...\n\nHardware manufacturer Nvidia has updated its Shield Android TV system software, putting the platform one step ahead of competing microconsoles with support for Android 6.0 Marshmallow, among other significant features and additions.\n\nNotably, the Shield Android TV is now the first Android-powered microconsole to support the Vulkan graphics API, an open-standard framework that promises \"highly efficient, low-level access to modern graphics hardware.\"\n\nRelated: Nvidia's Shield is a 4K streaming box with serious game at gaming\n\n\"Today, Nvidia is equipping Android developers with fully conformant Vulkan drivers just one week after the specifications launched,\" the manufacturer announced. \"In addition, Google has announced that Vulkan will be a core platform API in a future version of Android to drive new classes of interactive user experiences.\"\n\nThe platform's update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow enables support for a number of recently released mobile apps and games, including Real Racing 3, Oddworld Munch's Oddysee, Minecraft Story Mode, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories.\n\nShield Android TV owners can also tap into a library of console-quality games via the GeForce NOW streaming service.

But we didn't always have these luxuries. From Lewis Latimer, who improved on the light bulb, to Gerald A. Lawson, who brought us the first home gaming console, black engineers have been solving problems that improve our lives.\n\nBlack engineers, however, are underrepresented in engineering fields. According to a 2015 U.S. Labor survey, black engineers make up only about 6.3 percent of the engineering workforce. Here, in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are a number of black engineers who are dedicated to increasing diversity in engineering. So we want to recognize some of those engineers -- past and present -- that have and continue to advance diversity in STEM.\n\nHoward P. Grant\n\nFirst on our list is Howard P. Grant. He was the first black student to graduate from the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He went on to work as a civil engineer for the City and County of San Francisco in the water department. In addition to his engineering contributions, he also helped pave the way for young black engineers. In 1970 he hosted the first meeting of the Northern California Council of Black Professional Engineers (NCCBPE), a group which is dedicated to advancing the engineering careers of African American and black youth as well as educating the public about science and engineering. He served as NCCBPE president from 1970 to 1973.\n\nAisha Bowe\n\nAisha Bowe is an award winning aerospace engineer. She has worked as a researcher for NASA Ames Research Center and is now the CEO of the startup STEMBoard, which she co-founded. In addition to being an engineering firm, STEMBoard hosts free STEM camps for elementary through high school students, and partners with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to encourage more students of color to pursue STEM careers.\n\nRay Gilstrap\n\nRay Gilstrap is an electrical engineer at NASA Ames Research Center. He has helped set up and maintain satellite internet services for different scientific expeditions. His work has taken him all over the world, including to an island in the Arctic where he helped with communications at a climate change research station. He is also an avid volunteer through NASA, sharing his love of engineering with students throughout the Bay Area.\n\nNancy Douyon\n\nNancy Douyon is a human factors engineer and a user experience research program manager at Google. Among other projects, she works on making Android phones user-friendly, intuitive and adaptive to different audiences. Prior to Google, Nancy worked at IBM Interactive Research, Accenture Experience Agency, and Intel's Mobility Group. She also does outreach around the globe to educate minorities in tech about user experience, design and personal career management.\n\nChantal Emmanuel\n\nChantal Emmanuel is a web developer for a start-up company called Red Clay Design. They provide an online platform that assists users in designing various products, including a smart watch for grandparents. In addition to her work with Red Clay, she is on the steering committee of Bay Area Blacks in Tech, a meetup group that helps increase the representation of African Americans and blacks in tech fields.\n\nDo you know a Bay Area engineer that you'd like to recognize and add to our list? Leave a comment below or tweet us at @KQEDedspace", "Last month, it was announced that 25 years' worth of Nicktoon characters -- possibly everyone from Eliza Thornberry to Invader Zim to Ginger to Doug -- will join forces in one all-star, ensemble, Avengers-style movie. A lot of these guys were on the airwaves back in the '90s. Seeing the fan-made promo images made me nostalgic. But it also made me think: Wow. Cartoons in the '90s were weird as hell.\n\nI watched a lot of TV as a kid. A lot. It's not because I hated sunlight or human interaction, either. It's because the cartoons on TV consistently captured my imagination, or left me in a foetal position on the living room floor from laughing so hard. Sometimes they even freaked me out and haunted me. And I couldn't stop watching. When you look up episodes of these old shows online, one thing is clear: '90s cartoons were odd. Dark. At times, deeply disturbing. That's what made them fantastic.\n\nLet's start with The Ren & Stimpy Show. In 1992, the New York Times dubbed it \"the most original thing to happen to children's television since Pee-wee's Playhouse\" and said it made \"the free-form humour of Rocky and Bullwinkle look like a Noh drama\". Concerned parents rallied against it. I was obsessed.\n\nI wasn't the only one in my house who was, either. My dad loved the show. Every Saturday afternoon when a new episode aired, he ran in from mowing the lawn, cracked open a beer and howled with me at Stimpy showing off his \"magic nose goblins\" (varicoloured snot globs collected under a table), or at the disgusting close-up stills of the characters, liver spots and yellowed toenails galore. I had a plush Stimpy that proudly declared \"They don't call me stupid for nothing!\" when you pulled the hairball-on-a-string from its mouth. \"Happy happy, joy joy\" became a mantra in the Lufkin household for the better part of the Clinton administration.\n\nThe beheaded ghost of Honest Abe assaulting Ren and Stimpy after they crack open the Lincoln Monument, whose head was full of caramel corn. Image: Giphy\n\nThe show was edgy and uncomfortable and envelope-pushing. That's why my dad -- and uncle, and older babysitter, and many people in my life 18 or older -- liked it, too. In fact, for a lot of people... it was too weird. Too adult. Lots of my friends weren't allowed to watch it. I could never imagine it being on a kids' network in 2016.\n\nBut Ren & Stimpy was super mainstream and a massive hit for Nick, which is what made it even more nuts. I freely spouted off lines from the show throughout childhood, with little regard to my surroundings or who I was with. For example, as a little kid I'd randomly break out into the jingles for \"Log\" or \"Don't Whiz on the Electric Fence\" in front of the women in my mum's bunco group, who half laughed, half side-eyed each other worriedly.\n\nIn one iconic episode, a musician on a vinyl record (named Stinky Wizzleteats) teaches the boys the \"happy happy, joy joy\" dance, and suddenly spits out, \"I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs!\" Not exactly an oft-heard phrase, but it sounds pretty, uh, inappropriate, right?\n\nWell, one day not long after seeing that episode (this was early primary school), my dad took me to go see a Power Rangers Live show. We're in our seats, and at one point, the evil Putty henchmen were evilly looking into crowd, interacting, firing off snide, evil comments, hunting for the Rangers. I decided to be a wise guy, and cried out from my seat: \"Ah, go suck an egg!\" Yeah, that didn't go over well -- Dad death-grabbed my arm and gave me the \"no video games for a month\" glare, while the mum in front of me whispered to her own son loud enough so I could hear, \"I never want to hear you say that.\"\n\nWhile a public outburst during a performance like mine is rude by itself, it turns out the offensive-sounding term I heard on Ren & Stimpy actually wasn't bad at all! Apparently it's an old idiom that means \"to try to tell or show someone more knowledgeable or experienced than oneself how to do something\".\n\nStill, at that moment, based on the reactions of the adults around me, I sort of fully realised how crude, and potentially inappropriate, this \"children's\" cartoon was. But hey -- I thought the show was hilarious! That's all that mattered to me. Besides, what's wrong with humour that's strange or blue or that makes some people uncomfortable -- even if it's a kids' cartoon?\n\nNothing out of the ordinary here! Image: Giphy\n\nAnother one of my favourites was Rocko's Modern Life. At first glance, it looked like as goofy or whimsical as any children's program: A talking wallaby from Australia works in a comic shop and gets into misadventures with his neighbours. Sounds cute! But there were episodes where it got strange, and I was a big fan.\n\nIn one episode, Heffer chokes on a chicken bone, goes to hell and meets a Grim Reaper-esque demon named Peaches who has udders for a head and starts spraying milk everywhere. In another, Really Really Big Man's Nipples of the Future go haywire and strike panicked bystanders in the crowd. One time, anthropomorphic toad Mr Bighead uses a walking, talking, prophetic magic meatball that augurs all the right business decisions to get Mr Bighead rapidly promoted. Bighead and the meatball end up getting married.\n\n'Run for your lives -- the nipples are outta control!' Image: Giphy\n\nI knew that every time I was going to watch one of those shows, I was going to laugh, hard. One of my good friends, to this day, maintains that he nearly wet himself in primary school during one Rocko episode's \"Wacky Deli\" segment: a stream-of-thought toon-within-a-toon that features jarringly animated talking cold cuts, plus live-action shots of a manicured hand smashing a picnic meatloaf, all set to polka music. (It was the inane, amateur cartoon Rocko and his own buddies cobbled together, and ended up becoming a hit.)\n\nThe 'Wacky Deli' episode of Rocko's Modern Life. Image: YouTube\n\nNick wasn't the only place to find stupefyingly inventive and hilarious cartoons in the '90s. Cartoon Network was starting to take off at that time, too. Remember Cow and Chicken? The slapstick show followed two siblings; he was fowl, she was bovine and they got into weird adventures with a foppish, naked, blatantly Satan-like antagonist, whose rotating aliases often punned off his huge arse, like Major Wedgie or Mrs Barederri\u00e8re. Oh yeah, they had human parents. Don't worry about it.\n\nFast forward to 2000, when I had to wake up at the crack of dawn for high school. I usually ate breakfast in front of the TV, and for some reason, I remember watching a lot of 6am Cow and Chicken reruns on Cartoon Network. I don't think it was out of nostalgia, per se -- I actually didn't watch a lot of the show when I was younger. But I didn't want to watch the local news or infomercials, and I was drawn to the at-times-adult humour. So it became a morning ritual. It's what I watched, and laughed at, while I was half-asleep eating a granola bar.\n\nCow and Chicken's Red Guy in a rare non-naked moment. Image: pop-crash.tumblr.com\n\nSee, Nickelodeon was pretty much the first television network that was devoted almost entirely to kids' programming. So when Nick, and later Cartoon Network, wanted to start producing original shows, they gave carte blanche to the animators who wanted to fill these new channels' airwaves. Those genius artists were folks who grew up on the screwball slapstick of Looney Toons, and were likely reacting to the squeaky clean fare of the '80s, such as Care Bears or DuckTales.\n\nAnd so we got the joined-at-the-rump hybrid creature CatDog. Or Action League Now, with its perpetually naked superhero. Or a show that was literally called The Angry Beavers. I'm also just scratching the surface, here. Let's not forget Freakazoid!, Beetlejuice, The Tick, KaBlam! or Earthworm Jim, which spanned cable and basic channels alike in the US. Looking back, it all felt pretty experimental and daring.\n\nThere were dives into taboos and topics that were pretty far out of my primary school scope. It was rare to find an episode of Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures that didn't reference the politics or pop culture of the day, which probably went over the heads of the young viewers: for example Elmyra having a dance party in her bedroom, then suddenly yanking off her shirt to reveal a cone bra, and exclaiming: \"Costume change! -- Now I'm Madonna!\" Another Tiny Toons episode was banned for showing Buster, Plucky and Hamton getting drunk off beer (in order to show the dangers of alcohol).\n\nAt other times, things got borderline sexual. Rocko and his pals frequented a fast food joint that was literally called the Chokey Chicken. Obviously, the masturbation gag was lost on nine-year-old me, but its inclusion hints at just how much of a wild frontier kids' animation was during the decade. In another episode, it's suggested that Rocko and his friends stumble upon the Bigheads' sex tapes.\n\nThe tone of kids' shows in the '90s swung like a 360-degree pendulum, knocking into territories that were topical, cerebral, frightening, stomach-turning, sarcastic, silly, surreal, non sequitur, flatulent.\n\nThese shows had a huge impact on my sense of humour, and served as a gateway to the twisted stuff I found funny later in life: I'm a Salad Fingers fan. My late teens involved a lot of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Tim & Eric. The lawnmower Mad Men scene is my favourite. It might also be why I love Tim Burton and David Lynch -- Eraserhead barely fazed me, which makes sense considering I ate Cocoa Puffs in front of cartoons that had scenes like this:\n\nSometimes, Nick would air animated shorts during commercial breaks. I don't really remember most of them, but one scared the absolute shit out of me. Not in a, like, boo-it's-a-ghost! kind of way, but in a disturbing, existentially sinister way. As in, it kept me awake in my bed at night after my parents told me good night. Friends, I give you \"The Killing of an Egg\":\n\nSee?! See what I mean? I have a hard time imagining this airing on kids' TV today. I mean, it was too eerie even for me, but hey -- here I am, 30, and I still remember it. When YouTube became a thing, I remember sitting in my university dorm, reaching into the nooks of my memory banks to fish out enough search terms to Google it up. (\"Egg\", \"cartoon\", \"house crashing\", \"death\".) It was totally creepy, but I sure as hell never forgot it. I even thought during commercials back in the day, \"Where's that scary egg cartoon? I kinda wanna see it again.\"\n\nWhen I watch cartoons today -- which I do pretty often, especially when I'm hungover and eating cold pizza on Saturday mornings -- I notice that, while Nick or Cartoon Network may or may not be operating at '90s-level weirdness levels, there are definitely shows that the oldies laid the groundwork for.\n\nA recent example? The fantastic Adventure Time, which, to no one's surprise, has armies of grownup fans as well as kids. Not since the '90s has an animated show on a mostly children's network so deftly handled fandoms of all ages. Fun fact: Creator Pendleton Ward has said he was inspired by Ren & Stimpy. Even SpongeBob Squarepants -- which is technically a '90s show! And it's got the weirdness to prove it, with characters like nihilist Plankton with his robot wife, Karen.\n\nFreaky lookin' friends from Aaahh!! Real Monsters. Image: YouTube\n\nI'm very interested in what this upcoming Nickelodeon ensemble movie will look like, especially given the fact it's going to be mixed with live action, Roger Rabbit-style: Will certain characters be allowed to be as gross and bizarre as they were 20 years ago? Will Stimpy still make loving effigies of Ren out of earwax? Will Filburt still deliver updates about his chronic nausea? And will Daggett and Norbert still love horror movies about crawling killer spleens with thumbs?\n\nOne thing's for sure. Most '90s toons never patronised their young audiences, and they never dumbed anything down. They knew they were weird and they celebrated it. Whenever I watch my Ren & Stimpy complete collection DVD box set -- the same one I asked my parents for on my 21st birthday -- I realise, damn. They don't make 'em like this any more.\n\nTop image: Giphy\n\nHave you subscribed to Gizmodo Australia's email newsletter?

Tech stocks also are holding up better than some other battered sectors, such as financial and healthcare stocks.\n\nAlthough the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index is down 6.2 percent this year, the S&P Information Technology index is off 7.1 percent.\n\nThe pullback includes the widely followed FANG stocks -- Facebook (down 0.1 percent this year), Amazon.com (down 20.9 percent), Netflix (down 22 percent) and Google parent Alphabet (down 7.2 percent). Another tech leader, Apple, is down 8.8 percent.\n\nTech stocks were one of the strongest sectors in 2015 as the overall market basically moved sideways. This year, as plunging oil prices and fears of slower economic growth worldwide pushed the overall market lower, tech stocks also were hit as many investors sold to take profits from the shares' 2015 rally.\n\nDespite the losses this year, Amazon.com is still up 41 percent over the last 12 months. Facebook is up 31.7 percent and Microsoft has a 19.1 percent gain.\n\nTech stocks by their nature often are volatile whether the companies are involved in hardware, apps, data storage or social media. In many cases the companies are relatively young with little or no earnings or they're competing in fast-growing emerging markets.\n\nInvestors often are betting that the companies will enjoy rapid sales growth that eventually will produce sustained profits. But there's tremendous risk because if there's any sign that the growth will be less than expected, the stocks can suffer.\n\nThe slide in tech stocks in the first six weeks of this year effectively put many of the stocks on sale, prompting some professional money managers and other investors to buy them again and help the sector rebound.\n\nIn fact, analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence recently raised their rating on tech stocks partly due to \"attractive valuations\" and because they believe Wall Street's estimates for many of the companies' earnings growth this year \"are overly pessimistic.\"\n\nThe headlines generated by the shortfalls at LinkedIn, Tableau Software and other firms also \"resulted in the investing public becoming overly negative on the technology sector,\" said Scott Kessler, a tech analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nStill, investors are being very selective about which tech stocks they buy this time around. The stocks \"are cheaper but I wouldn't call them cheap,\" said Deborah Koch, co-manager of the Northern Trust Technology Fund.\n\nMany tech stocks are still struggling to climb back to their once lofty levels. For example, chipmaker Intel is still down 16.7 percent this year, activity tracker Fitbit is down a whopping 47.3 percent this year and cybersecurity firm FireEye has dropped 33 percent.\n\n\"I don't think we're seeing a mass bubble popping in the technology sector,\" O'Hare said. \"You are seeing targeted popping of some high 'price-to-earnings~ multiple stocks that was probably overdue.\n\n\"This market no longer is willing to pay for growth at any price,\" he said. \"People are trying to search for bargains but also they want quality growth.\"\n\nMuch of the tech sector concern over the last few weeks stems from weaker economic growth worldwide, which means less corporate spending for information-technology goods and services.\n\n\"There is no question there has been a downtick in global IT spending,\" Koch said. \"Tech is very sensitive to economic growth.\"\n\nAmong the hardest hit: The stock market's newest -- and thus most unproven -- companies. Many of the firms that had their initial public offerings last year are now trading below their IPO prices, including Fitbit, Columbia Pipeline Group and payment-processing firm First Data.\n\nThe U.S. dollar's strength also has been a head wind for many tech companies because their overseas sales in foreign currencies convert to fewer dollars, O'Hare said.\n\nThat has led many investors to focus on the \"legacy\" tech stocks such as Facebook, Alphabet and Apple that have solid histories of sales and earnings growth.\n\n\"We've leaned a bit more into legacy companies,\" Koch said. \"They have much more reasonable valuations\" relative to their growth prospects, she said.\n\nBut not every investor is preoccupied by the current volatility in tech stocks.\n\nGavin Baker, manager of Fidelity Investments' OTC Portfolio Fund, said he maintains a long-term focus on \"investing in great companies that are at the center of multi-decade trends.\"\n\nAlthough concerns about world economies, oil prices and China are weighing on stocks today, Baker said, \"I don't expect that to have any impact on the five- or 10-year outlook for e-commerce, Internet advertising or solar power.\"", "Apple's pressure-sensitive tool is incredible for drawing and writing on the iPad Pro's screen, but its navigational ability is just as important.\n\nWhen the Apple Pencil launched alongside the iPad Pro, I was primarily excited to test it as a drawing and writing tool. I'd hoped that it would, at last, satisfy my yearning for a perfect iPad stylus, and it did: The Pencil is an incredible tool for artists, drafters, and calligraphers alike.\n\nBut unlike a real-world pencil or pen, the Pencil is also a competent navigational tool on the iPad Pro's screen. You can tap on brushes or buttons with it, of course, but also perform any of iOS's other finger-based gestures: swiping menus in or out, selecting text, and scrolling lists.\n\nI've never been much of a navigational-stylus-on-the-iPad person, so it initially surprised me when I began using my Pencil outside of traditional drawing and sketching apps. But on the iPad Pro, it feels right -- especially if you're switching between sketching a drawing or altering a photo with the Pencil to another app. If I'm looking at Google Images in one Split View pane while drawing in the other, it's easy to move the Pencil from side to side.\n\nI also found it hugely useful at times when I couldn't sit or stand at a desk: When I first got the iPad Pro, I was recovering from an illness, and spent about a week working on the couch. When reading, the Pro's screen was often just a hair too far away or awkwardly angled for me to scroll or tap with my fingers alone, but the angle and length of the Pencil made it the perfect tool to use on the screen while I rested.\n\nUnfortunately, whether by bug or intentional design, the Pencil's navigational prowess appears to have vanished in the iOS 9.3 public betas. With 9.3, you can no longer scroll or manipulate text; the only places the Pencil works are on canvas or when pressing digital buttons.\n\nWhether by bug or intentional design, the Pencil's navigational prowess appears to have vanished in iOS 9.3\n\nNormally, I don't write about beta bugs and features, because it's a beta: There are always bugs, and features change. But this functionality is important enough that I wanted to talk about it before Apple submits its final 9.3 release. It could be a bug, yes: But several betas in, we've seen fixes for Smart Connector keyboards and new features, and the Pencil remains crippled. Which makes me think, more and more, that this is a conscious decision on the part of Apple's engineering team. (I did reach out to the company about the issue, and will update if and when I receive a response.)\n\nI can partially understand the reasoning behind the change: Navigation isn't one of the Pencil's primary uses, and you've never needed a stylus to use an iOS device, after all.\n\nBut the fact remains that the Pencil's owners use those navigation options, and frankly, the idea that Apple would take away functionality that people have come to expect and depend on is a significant hit to usability and overall experience.\n\nThere's no reason to limit functionality on the Pencil.\n\nWorse, it makes the Pencil useless for video and audio editing, creative pursuits that I'd hoped to explore further on the iPad Pro. I'd initially enjoyed editing and cutting several videos in iMovie for iOS with the help of the Pencil; now, you can only select and drag clips. You can't cut a clip with the downward swipe gesture, nor can you scroll the timeline.\n\nIf it's not interfering with the iOS touch architecture -- and according to third-party developers I've talked with, it shouldn't be -- there's no reason to limit functionality on the Pencil.\n\nI'm not the only one upset about this issue. Earlier this month, Relay.fm founder and host Myke Hurley wrote about his concerns. Stephen Hackett, Relay co-founder (and iMore contributor), is also concerned:\n\nRemoving the functionality relegates the Pencil to just a creative tool, not a utility that can be used system-wide. While I appreicate that it is a great option for drawing, for those of us who wanted to use it outside of that box, it feels like a bad change in direction.\n\nThe Pencil has also been hugely beneficial for those with RSI (Repetitive Strain Injuries), including Hello Internet host and YouTube producer CGP Grey. He told iMore:\n\nI've been dealing with RSI for years, and I've found that nothing works as well for managing that [on the Mac] as Wacom pen tablets. Anyone used to a pen tablet -- including most professional digital artists on a Mac -- would find it crazy and infuriating if Wacom didn't let them manipulate interface elements.\n\nMost of my work is on iOS now, especially after the introduction of the Pro; as such, being able to use the pen to navigate the iOS interface is a huge deal for me, because using the iPad with my hands held like I'm fingerpainting isn't good for them. It causes strain if I'm working on the tablet all day. I was on the beta, but downgraded back because not being able to use the pen for all interface elements got uncomfortable, fast. Switching back and forth between fingers and pen seemed worse than either alone.\n\nThis is a plea to the development team at Apple: There's still time to add these Pencil features back for the final iOS 9.3 release. They're not only useful for the folks that just draw or sketch with the Pencil -- they also provide functionality for video and audio editing, and offer priceless accessibility for those who have trouble with their hands.", "By now you probably can tell if the newly introduced LG G5 is better than the G4. The addition of \"Friends\" makes it more interesting than ever. No, that's not your favorite TV show but LG's recent innovation announced at the pre-MWC 2016 launch. The LG G5 is the South Korean tech giant's first take of the modular phone. The latter is something that we've waiting for since learning about the Project Ara by Google -- which by the way, is still a work in progress.\n\nThe LG G5 features a simple modular design. The idea is that you change a module or a component to optimize a special feature. We've seen the first two official product videos earlier and now, we'll try to compare the new LG G5 with the LG G4.\n\nAt first glance, you'd easily notice there is indeed an obvious difference in the design. Unlike the other flagship smartphone (aka Galaxy S7) that looks so much like its predecessor, the LG G5 looks nothing like the G4. It's a plus already because that means people won't be confused between the two. However, the new rounded corners of the phone make the G5 a bit similar to the Nexus 5X manufactured by LG. Last year's G4 had the squared off corners.\n\nThe LG G4 was introduced with different options for the back panel. The most notable and attractive was the leather cover but the bare G4 we have in the photo above shows the beauty of the old flagship.\n\nWhen it comes to specs, we're expecting that everything will be upgraded from the LG G4. Sadly, not every feature was updated or made bigger. From 5.5-inches, the screen is down to 5.3-inches. LG still used the same Quad HD IPS Quantum Display and 2560 x 440 pixel resolution but there's a slight difference in the total ppi -- 554ppi on the LG G5 and 538 on the G4. There's also the new Always On Display.\n\nLG used the latest Snapdragon 820 on the G5 versus the S808 from last year. RAM has been amped up to 4GB from 3GB. Built-in storage is still the same at 32GB and there's still microSD card slot for memory expansion.\n\nWhen it comes to imaging, the LG G4's 16MP rear camera with OIS, F1.8, and laser autofocus can also be found on the LG G5 but with the addition of a wide 8MP sensor with F2.4. The latter actually makes up the Dual Cam feature of the new premium flagship we noted a while ago. Meanwhile, the 8MP front camera remains unchanged.\n\nThe standard connectivity features from the G4 can also be found on the G5 including WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (2.4/5GHz), NFC, and Bluetooth. The LG G5 gets USB Type-C as a new addition. Both phones come with a a fingerprint sensor and a fast charging technology.\n\nThe LG G5's modular design makes it a winner. It's exciting to note the accessories we can add to the G5. Power up the phone from zero to full in an instant with the quick battery swap design. Other LG Friends accessories include a 360 camera , Tone Platinum wireless headphones, and the Hi-Fi Plus with B&O PLAY.\n\nFollowing the LG V10, the LG G5 also now comes with an Always-on display which is something the G4 doesn't have. The modular design makes the G5 a worthy upgrade from the G4. However, we're not certain how LG will be able to sustain the idea.\n\nThere's no mention yet if other companies can make their own modules and \"Friends\" for the G5. For now, we're interested to know if LG will still make some more and at what rate.", "Adobe's suite of mobile tools has really exploded with functionality recently to take full advantage of the advancements in hardware and software. The latest update to Lightroom on Android now has RAW support for mobile photography enthusiasts to enjoy. The version also adds a few other features like split toning and haze removal that have been part of the iOS build since last year. In fact, Adobe actually claims that the main reason for the update is this feature parity, but the added bonus of RAW support could turn out to be the bigger draw.\n\nGoogle has been integrating RAW capture API's inside Android since Lollipop, and that is precisely what Adobe has leveraged to save stills to Adobe's DNG format. In contrast, Apple does not allow that functionality within iOS, not yet at least. The feature should work on most any recent Android device, but as with all hardware-dependant features within Google's mobile OS, your mileage may vary.\n\nYou can download the new Adobe Photoshop Lightroom app from the Google Play store at the source link below.", "Last week the cold Crypto War between vendors and government turned hot: the United States Department of Justice got a court order demanding that Apple to hack an iPhone 5c that was carried by one of the San Bernardino shooters.\n\nThis is to help Federal Bureau of Investigation gain access to its contents, in case there's something incriminating on the phone. The hack in question would require Apple to write code that disables certain iPhone security features.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Juha Saarinen: Keeping your phone secure, the Google way\n\n* Juha Saarinen: A safer internet? Not going to happen\n\n* Juha Saarinen: Unlinking the web\n\nFBI wants protections against \"brute force cracking\" or guessing an iPhone's lock code removed so that it can enter them quickly as many times as it takes until the right one is found; without the hack, iPhones are designed to first stall too-frequent lock code entries, with increasing wait times between each try, and the device will lock itself after ten incorrect guesses.\n\nThis won't set a precedent, it's not a backdoor, and it is perfectly safe and necessary, FBI says.\n\nApple vehemently disagrees, and says that such a hack will endanger other iPhone users (those with newer devices than the iPhone 5c) as well. The company can do it, but Apple doesn't want to because it believes once the cat is out of the bag, millions of its customers will be less secure.\n\nIf Apple breaks into the phone for the US government, what's to stop other authorities around the world including repressive regimes from demanding the same?\n\nHere, it's worth remembering that what constitutes a serious crime varies hugely around the world.\n\nSecurity expert Jonathan Zdziarski who specialises in Apple iOS and who has testified in court cases puts its succinctly:\n\nAn American is arrested in a foreign country and faces death for being gay. Foreign country orders that Apple backdoor a phone. Now what?\n\nThere will be pressure from now on from governments on Apple to provide the hack that FBI demands; if Apple doesn't have the hack, it will be that much easier to resist the pressure.\n\nFurthermore, keeping the hack secret might not be possible.\n\nZdziarski believes that the hack would have to be certified as a forensic Instrument by the court to be accepted as part of the evidence gathering process.\n\nThat means the hack would have to be extensively documented, tested to make sure it doesn't change anything on the device, and peer reviewed by a US standards body before it is accepted in court. This is standard procedure for forensic instruments, Zdziarski said.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the hack would be subject to such rigorous vetting, but if it did, it would make Apple's concerns about having to provide similar assistance to each and every government moot, as the details will be out in the open.\n\nThere's also some doubts around how much valuable information Farook's iPhone actually contains.\n\nIt was given to him by his employer, subject to monitoring, and it is not his personal device. He destroyed two of his own phones.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the hack would be subject to such rigorous vetting, but if it did, it would make Apple's concerns about having to provide similar assistance to each and every government moot, as the details will be out in the open.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone will have had its cellular spoors - location and call data from mobile phone telcos - well and truly captured, along with iCloud backups from Apple. That's quite a bit of data on Farook's activities already.\n\nThe iCloud backups are only until October 19 last year. There might have been newer backups, but these stopped after Farook's employer reset the iCloud password after confiscating the phone after being asked by the police.\n\nNot only that, the police turned off the iPhone completely. This is a no-no in IT forensics, as it makes access to the device far harder than if it had been left charged and running and partially unencrypted.\n\nLeaving possible police forensic incompetence aside, there's plenty of stake on both sides, and neither side feels it can back down.\n\nA safe guess is that Apple and other tech vendors will do their damnedest to ensure they won't be in a similar Mexican stand-off with the law again. This means more services, devices and storage will be strongly encrypted, with users having the keys, not the vendors.\n\nIn other words, the whole exercise could backfire for law enforcement who will have to contend with much more secure devices soon.\n\nBut, if you're gay or a political dissident, or both, and don't want your nearest and dearest and friends to be picked up by the police and murdered along with you because their details were found in your smartphone, what can you do?\n\nApart from minimising smartphone use, and what's stored on it, set a long, complicated password. It's too easy to crack the four-digit PINs, something Apple recognised in iOS 9 when it made the passcode a minimum of six numbers.\n\nMake it even more complicated than six numbers, with plenty of digits, letters and symbols, and you'll have served the life in prison sentence before the police guess your passcode.\n\nThey'll probably try to beat the passcode out of you, but at least you've made them work a bit harder than they'd normally need to.", "Opening Volume Of The Bestselling Japanese Space Opera To Be Published In English For The First Time\n\nSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) February 22, 2016\n\nVIZ Media's Haikasoru literary imprint announces its first release of 2016 with the North American publication of author Yoshiki Tanaka's epic space opera/military sci-fi novel, LEGEND OF THE GALACTIC HEROES, on March 8th.\n\nLEGEND OF THE GALACTIC HEROES, VOLUME 1: DAWN is the first in the author's celebrated series set to be released by Haikasoru, with Volumes 2 and 3 debuting this summer and fall, respectively.

While they look almost identical to the S6 line, Samsung is bringing back a memory-card slot and adding a longer-life battery after the absence of a removable power unit alienated fans last year.\n\nSamsung's efforts to win back customers saw it keep the form and shape of last year's models while fixing its shortcomings and touting their potential role in the coming virtual reality boom. With earnings sliding in a stalling smartphone market and the shares battered by three straight annual declines, South Korea's biggest company needs a hit product after the S6 failed to set the records that had been predicted.\n\n\"Samsung's trying to shift consumers' sights to bundled products, such as VR headsets and a 360 degree camera, which would help it keep the smartphone margin from decline,\" Lee Jae Yun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co., said in Seoul. \"This is a good try but Samsung can't help slashing the prices of new premium smartphones to keep its market share. \"\n\nReduced drain\n\nAt the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, Samsung took the wraps off a 360-degree camera designed to work with the S7. Ian Fogg, an analyst with IHS Technology, called the Gear 360 accessory a \"halo\" product that will help boost sales of the smartphone in a decelerating global market.\n\n\"The market for the smartphone is obviously slowing down a little bit,\" Jean-Daniel Ayme, vice president of European telecom operations at Samsung, said in an interview. \"When you're using one of these new devices, this is more than a phone, this is your camera, your MP3 player, your TV, your recorder, it's everything and more, and more is coming.\"\n\nSamsung abandoned removable batteries and a memory card slot from its marquee phone last year as it sought to make its devices thinner. The move backfired as it eliminated two key ways in which the company's devices were differentiated from iPhones. Samsung cut prices on the S6 smartphones in July last year, just three months after launch. Ayme said the company has managed to crack the power issue.\n\n\"This phone is more powerful than any phone we have launched in the past, but it also has optimized software that will reduce the battery drain, and we have managed to put a larger battery in a smaller package,\" Ayme said.\n\nHeads up\n\nInvestors are keeping an eye on the smartphone's public unveiling, and on its ability to stand out from a thicket of devices -- from LG Electronics Inc.'s G5 and Xiaomi Corp.'s Mi 5 -- that are being unveiled in Spain. LG's 5.3-inch smartphone will go on sale globally as early as the end of March, except in Japan, said Woo Ram Chan, vice president of LG's mobile product planning division.\n\nThe stock fell 1.3 percent to close at 1,175,000 won in Seoul. Itsshares have declined about 7 percent so far this year after dropping 5.1 percent in 2015.\n\nThe new S7 models are waterproof for as long as 30 minutes in water 1.5 meters deep and come in gold, silver, white and black. Also included is wireless charging and Marshmallow, the latest version of Google Inc.'s Android operating system.\n\nThe Galaxy maker, which is banking on Samsung Pay as another differentiator, added a list of regional banks and credit unions, including the Charlotte Metro Credit Union and NCPA Federal Credit Union, to the list of partners for its mobile payments service. The platform will be rolled out in China next month.\n\nZero to hero\n\nSamsung's codename for the S7 development project was 'Hero' while last year's plan for the S6 adopted the title 'Zero' as the company tried to return to the fundamentals in its design.\n\nThis year's models hit the market about a month earlier than the S6 did in 2015. While wireless carriers will decide on prices and calling plans, the S7s will probably be at a similar price level to last year's device, according to Drew Blackard, director of product marketing at Samsung. Some operators could include a free Gear VR headset with the S7, the company said without elaborating.\n\nThe Gear 360 camera features two back-to-back fisheye lenses that each can capture a 180-degree image and stream it to the S7, earlier S6 models and the Note 5.\n\nSocial networks, including Facebook Inc. and Google's YouTube, recently starting supporting 360-degree videos -- a format used by virtual reality hardware, and which on regular computers and mobile devices allows viewers to dynamically alter the angle they view a scene from.\n\nShrinking share\n\nAyme says this, coupled with the Samsung's S7, Gear 360 camera and Gear VR headset, gives consumers a full taste of virtual reality, allowing consumers to create their own content rather than waiting for it to become commercially available.\n\n\"Something that used to be only accessible to a few people with a lot of knowledge about computing and with very powerful computing engines, is now available to everybody,\" he said.\n\nWhether virtual reality will prove an effective selling point remains to be seen. While the South Korean company remains the world's largest smartphone producer, its global market share fell in 2015 as Apple, Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. won customers, according to researcher Strategy Analytics Inc.\n\nSamsung last month warned of falling global demand and economic turbulence after its quarterly earnings missed analysts' estimates.\n\nSamsung, which misread demand for the S6 when it failed to produce enough three-sided screens for the Edge, said it won't face the same problem this year.", "By far the biggest news coming out of last week was Google's decision to remove right sidebar ads. With every big story comes a lot of questions, confusion, and search marketers wanting to know more about that it means for them.\n\nThis post will try to clear up the confusion and answer the questions people have by compiling all of the confirmed information we have to-date.\n\nIs it Confirmed?\n\nYes, Google has confirmed the removal of right sidebar ads is being permanently rolled out worldwide in all languages. This decision only affects desktop queries since mobile queries were always devoid of right sidebar ads.\n\nNo More Sidebar Ads, Ever?\n\nNo, that is not accurate. Google's Product Listing Ads (PLAs) and ads within the Knowledge Graph will still display on the right sidebar for appropriate queries.\n\nThree or Four Text Ads?\n\nGoing forward, Google will be displaying three above-the-fold text ads for all queries. For \"highly commercial queries\" Google may display up to four text ads. Google gives the examples of searches for hotels and car insurance when describing \"highly commercial\" queries. In addition, there will be a section of ads below the first set of organic listings.\n\nWill This Affect The Visibility of Organic Listings?\n\nYou can be the judge of that. Here is an example from Twitter where Raj Nijjer of Yext shows zero organic listings appearing above the fold:\n\nSearched for \"Content Marketing\": 4 pack of Google ads + knowledge graph = no organic results above the fold pic.twitter.com/N8LJIO1jFm\n\n-- Raj Nijjer (@rajnijjer) February 20, 2016\n\nThese results are not typical, but it certainly paints a worrisome picture. In this example you'll see Google is displaying four, not three, AdWords ads; as well as a Knowledge Graph panel. The combination has resulted in no organic listings displayed above the fold.\n\nOf course, when only three ads and no Knowledge Graph panel are being displayed, there is more room for organic listings. But the fact is, with the inclusion of a fourth ad, last week's changes will at times affect the visibility of organic listings.\n\nWill Costs-Per-Click Go Up?\n\nWe probably won't get a definitive answer to this until the change has been in affect for some time. However, the basic principles of supply and demand indicate costs will go up.\n\nThere's now a reduced supply of above-the-fold ad positions, but the demand has not changed. This will make it likely that average CPCs will rise significantly for AdWords advertisers. That's just speculation at this point, and I'm sure advertisers are hoping otherwise, but it is a probable scenario.\n\nAnother probable scenario is that CPC's may decrease due to the fact there's more positions, leading to higher impression volume. There's also the question of advertiser bids, and whether or not placement at the bottom of the page will be valued as highly as placement in the sidebar.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to take into consideration, and more to learn as time goes on, but those are the important facts we know up to this point.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com", "Internet searches related to HIV hit a record high after actor Charlie Sheen reveled that he is HIV-positive, according to a new study.\n\nA study published Monday noted a huge uptick in Internet searches for information about HIV and HIV prevention, as well as a surge in news coverage about the virus, after the broadcast. Sheen said on the Today Show Nov. 17 that he is HIV-positive and had paid millions to keep his illness a secret.\n\nScientists say that Sheen's statement about his HIV-positive status helped raise awareness of virus and how to prevent it. HIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, weakens the immune system and can lead to AIDS.\n\nResearchers studied news reports and Google searches in the hours after the show and sorted data into four categories-- searches on HIV, condoms, HIV symptomology and HIV testing, according to a news release about the study. Researchers used archives such as the Bloomberg Terminal and Google Trends to collect data from as far back as 2004.\n\nThe study found that Sheen's statements correlated with the largest number of HIV-related Google searches ever on a single day in the United States, according to the news release. There were about 2.75 million more Google searches than predicted based on earlier trends.\n\nWhat scientists are now calling the \"Charlie Sheen Effect\" may have ultimately shown that messaging about HIV is connecting with the public, said John W. Ayers, a research professor at the San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health.\n\n\"Public health for more than three decades has delivered a consistent message about HIV: Get tested, know the signs and use condoms,\" Ayers said in a statement. \"That message was so well-ingrained that when the public was presented with Sheen's HIV-positive disclosure, they began seeking out public health salient information on HIV testing, the signs of HIV and condoms.\"\n\nIn addition, data showed that all HIV searches went up by 417 percent and searches about condoms increased 75 percent after Sheen's comments. And data on searches for HIV symptoms and testing showed respective increases of 540 percent and 214 percent.\n\nAs for media coverage, the day of Sheen's broadcast correlated with a 265 percent increase in news reports mentioning HIV and more than 6,500 stories were reported just through Google News.\n\n\"This big data strategy allowed us to provide a formative assessment of the potential impacts of Charlie Sheen's HIV-positive disclosure,\" said Benjamin M. Althouse, data architect of the study and research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling and the Santa Fe Institute. \"We can directly assess the diffusion of media in the population and how the population is seeking out information based on the timing and content of their Google searches.\"\n\nSheen is among other celebrities, such as basketball star Earvin \"Magic Johnson\", to publicly announce an HIV-positive status. However, scientists noted how the effect of Sheen's statement may be unique.\n\n\"Charlie Sheen's disclosure was potentially the most significant domestic HIV prevention event ever,\" said Mark Dredze, a Johns Hopkins researcher and study author. \"With Sheen, unlike with Magic Johnson for instance, we have smartphones in our pockets that we can easily use to learn about HIV within seconds with a single search or click.\"\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine on Monday. Other scientists from the University of California and University of North Carolina also contributed.\n\nRead the full study here.\n\nIn Oregon, an Oregon Health and Science University doctor is working on an HIV vaccine.

Companies like Google and Facebook operate on this basis and virtually every business decision stems from what data says about their customers and how they interact with their products and services.\n\nLeveraging data to win against competitors and skyrocket revenues should not just be reserved for the Google's of the world. Telecommunications companies generate enormous amounts of data each year - both structured and unstructured - on customer behaviors, preferences, payment histories, consumption levels, user patterns, customer experiences and more. And with analytics this data is a gold mine for those who know how to monetize it.\n\nTelco's data gold rush\n\nTelecom service providers previously only had access to aggregated, metered data and even when data types exploded, they lacked the technology to harness it and find meaningful insights into valuable customer usage patterns. Today, data is generated from each customer touch point - calls, text messages, roaming, video downloads, mobile commerce, custom relationship management systems, service calls and so on. Analyzing, this data has the potential to differentiate services, boost customer experiences and, ultimately, increase revenue.\n\nA recent McKinsey & Company study showed data-driven companies have a 50% chance of having sales well above competitors compared to customer analytics laggards. And according to McKinsey & Company benchmarking research, \"high-margin telecommunication companies tend to outperform their peers when it comes to data mining and otherwise gaining insights from collected customer information.\"\n\n3 ways to mine big data for better customer experiences\n\nAlready we're seeing telecom providers combine and analyze to better serve their customer base. In fact, big data analytics company, Guavus, released the findings of a global survey pointing to proactive customer care as the biggest single driver of big data analytics uptake among telcos.\n\nHere are three examples of what can be achieved:\n\nImproved customer retention\n\nFor every customer who complains, even more remain silent. As such, customer feedback is gold and with data analytics companies can make use of it and exploit it. Telcos can combine call center information, charging data records and CRM data to understand the biggest customer pain points. By analyzing customer complaints related to networks issues, such as dropped calls and slow connections, and correlating it with CRM data to see which customers have left, companies can better understand which network problems have the most impact on their customers. Armed with this information customer service teams can prioritize addressing hot issues and reduce churn.\n\nProactive customer care and reduced truck rolls\n\nAnalyzing big data can reduce unnecessary in-person appointments, service calls or truck rolls - which can cost several hundred dollars each - by resolving customer issues on the first call. To do this companies must be able to accurately predict which kinds of customer issues tend to result in the unnecessary truck rolls and develop a system for handling them more effectively through their call centers. With data analytics and visualizations, companies can generate custom reporting, interactive \"what-if\" scenarios and visualizations complete with clustering and a geographic heat map for network traffic. This allows providers to see where issues may arise and allocate resources accordingly.\n\nConsistent service experiences with accurate demand forecasts\n\nAs mobile broadband usage, high-definition television consumption, over-the-top and other services consume more network bandwidth, it's more important than ever to accurately plan for network capacity. To determine exactly where to lay the new infrastructure it is almost mandatory to take a data-driven approach by identifying concurrency in customer data regarding player sessions, peak usage times and dates, and then clustering this data to identify usage patterns. These patterns would help to forecast future growth and network demands. By analyzing terabytes of session data across a vast carrier network and generating a predictive trend analysis of customer video viewing behavior patterns, it is possible to have a new level of insight into customer behavior trends, which improves the ability to forecast for future demand and plan network investments.\n\nData analytics gives companies a whole new level of insight into customer behavior trends. More importantly, it opens up endless opportunities to improve customer experiences and keep customers happy.\n\nEditor's Note: In an attempt to broaden our interaction with our readers we have created this Reader Forum for those with something meaningful to say to the wireless industry.

Super-speed development with powerful backend SDKs and APIs for devs with CA Mobile App Services.\n\nSamsung recently debuted the latest iteration of their flagship Galaxy phone series, the S7. A constant innovator, the S7 packs a load of features, and while there might not be massive differences from its predecessor, the S6, noteworthy alterations promise to deliver for both users and developers alike.\n\nThe S7 comes in two variants, the S7 and S7 Edge. While the S6 and S6 Edge featured improved design, Samsung omitted water resistance, expandable storage, and a removable battery. Though the S7 may appear similar to the S6, it's a smattering of small changes that make the S7 a marked improvement over the previous generation. Notably, the MicroSD slot has made a comeback, which allows for up to an additional 200gb of storage, alongside 32gb built in. There's also IP68 dust and water resistance. Sealed ports mean no mandatory (and often cumbersome) rubber port covers.\n\nBattery life has been boosted, with 3,000mAh for the S7, and 3,600mAh in the Edge. A major concern for developers in the mobile space is battery life. Since limited battery capacity is a worry for consumers, it also affects developers. Devs are thus forced to concentrate on low power consumption in their apps. Though the S7 battery is still not removable, the beefier battery should meet developers and general user needs.\n\nRAM and processor upgrades make the S7 a true powerhouse phone. 4gb of RAM is standard, and a Snapdragon 820 processor provides a performance boost over the former Exynos chip. Virtual reality (VR) has blossomed in the mobile space, from budget headsets like the Google Cardboard to Samsung's own Gear VR. Accordingly, Samsung considered the prominence of VR when upgrading the S7.\n\nIf they made a Galaxy S7 developer edition is AOSP build I would buy 4 of them, no joke -- Fade Autumn (\n\n@blesstheautumn) February 9, 2016\n\nMany of the hardware changes are to accommodate breaking technology integrations, like VR. Powering virtual reality apps and headsets requires more computing performance, hence the 4gb of RAM, and Snapdragon 820. The return of the MicroSD slot means users have more native room for content and app storage. However, a noteworthy change is the exclusion of \"adoptable storage.\" The S7 does tout Marshmallow, but not Marshmallow's capability to reformat the MicroSD as unified storage for apps and files. Android Central writer Russell Holly explored the potentially groundbreaking VR potential of the S7, which comes loaded with Vulkan APIs. Renowned game developer Brianna Wu and Vulkan developer Sascha Willems lent their expertise to Holly's article. Even the Micro USB port was kept as its compatible with the Gear VR. From Feb. 23-March 18 2016, Samsung is actually including free Gear VR headsets with pre-orders.\n\nWanted to know what @VulkanAPI on the #galaxyS7 means, got amazing answers from @Spacekatgal and @SaschaWillems2 https://t.co/4QotXvFVYg -- Russell Holly (\n\n@russellholly) February 22, 2016\n\nThe S7 and S7 Edge prove that a few small tweaks go quite a long way. Samsung's forthcoming boasts all around improvements, and further, seeks to expand the intersection of the mobile and virtual reality spaces. For developers, Samsung has a meaty Samsung Galaxy portal with loads of SDKs ranging from Accessory to Camera, and Sensor Extension SDKs.", "Vaginal Ring With Drug Lowers HIV Rates in African Women\n\nNew York Times\n\nA flexible and inexpensive ring that is inserted into the vagina, where it slowly releases an antiviral drug, helped protect African women against contracting H.I.V. from their sexual partners, researchers said Monday in reports on two major studies ...\n\nAfter Charlie Sheen revealed he had HIV, Americans turned to Google in record numbersLos Angeles Times\n\nStudy finds anti-AIDS vaginal ring partially protects womenWashington Post\n\nCharlie Sheen's HIV Announcement Sparked Interest in Disease: StudyPhilly.com\n\nHollywood Reporter\n\nall 302 news articles \"", "The world's largest technology companies are making public the programming and hardware designs at the center of their businesses.\n\nThe world's biggest technology companies are handing over the keys to their success, making their artificial intelligence systems open-source.\n\nTraditionally, computer users could see the end product of what a piece of software did by, for instance, writing a document in Microsoft Word or playing a video game. But the underlying programming - the source code - was proprietary, kept from public view. Opening source material in computer science is a big deal because the more people that look at code, the more likely it is that bugs and long-term opportunities and risks can be worked out.\n\nOpenness is increasingly a big deal in science as well, for similar reasons. The traditional approach to science involves collecting data, analyzing the data and publishing the findings in a paper. As with computer programs, the results were traditionally visible to readers, but the actual sources - the data and often the software that ran the analyses - were not freely available. Making the source available to all has obvious communitarian appeal; the business appeal of open source is less obvious.\n\nMicrosoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon have been making remarkable progress developing artificial intelligence systems. Recently they have released much of their work to the public for free use, exploration, adaptation and perhaps improvement.\n\nThis seems bizarre: why would companies reveal the methods at the core of their businesses? And what does their embrace of open-source AI say about the current state of artificial intelligence?\n\nEach technology that's being revealed displays remarkable capabilities that go well beyond what was possible even just 10 years ago. They center on what is called \"deep learning\" - an approach that organizes layers of neural networks hierarchically to analyze very large data sets not just in search of simple statistics but also seeking to identify rich and interesting abstract patterns.\n\nAmong the technologies that major tech companies have opened recently are:\n\nTo understand what is driving these trends toward open source AI, it is helpful to consider other organizations in the broader social context in which these companies operate.\n\nOne useful comparison is DARPA, the research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense. It is hard to imagine an organization likely to be more concerned about others taking advantage of open information. Yet, DARPA has made a big push toward open-source machine learning technologies.\n\nIndeed, the DARPA XDATA program resulted in a catalog of state-of-the-art machine learning, visualization and other technologies that anyone can download, use and modify to build custom AI tools. (I was a research lead on the CrossCat/BayesDB project that was supported through this program.)\n\nThe fact that DARPA and the Defense Department are so supportive of open-sourcing strongly indicates that the advantages of open sourcing outweigh the disadvantages of making high-quality tools available to potential adversaries.\n\nAnother useful comparison is the OpenAI project, recently announced by tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Sam Altman, among others. The effort will study the ethics of creating and releasing machines with increasing abilities to interact with and understand the world.\n\nWhile these goals will be familiar to anyone who has read Isaac Asimov, they belie a deeper issue: even experts do not understand when or how AI might become powerful enough to cause harm, damage or injury.\n\nOpen sourcing of code allows many people to think through the consequences both individually and together. Ideally, that effort will advance software that is increasingly powerful and useful, but also broadly understandable in its mechanisms and their implications.\n\nAI systems involve large - often very very large - amounts of code, so much that it stretches the ability of any single individual to understand in both breadth and depth. Scrutiny, troubleshooting and bug-fixing are especially important in AI, where we are not designing tools to do a specific job (e.g., build a car), but to learn, adapt and make decisions in our stead. The stakes are larger both for the positive and potentially negative outcomes.\n\nNeither the motivations of DARPA nor OpenAI explain exactly why these commercial technology companies are open sourcing their AI code. As technology companies, their concerns are more immediate and concrete. After all, if nobody is using their products, then what good are nice clean code and well-intentioned algorithms?\n\nThere is a common view within the industry that technology companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are not in the businesses one might assume. Over the long run, Google and Facebook are not really in the business of selling ads, and Amazon is not in the business of selling merchandise. No, these technology companies are powered by your eyeballs (and data). Their currency is users. Google, for example, gives away email and search for free to draw users to its products; it needs to innovate quickly, producing more and better products to ensure you stay with the company.\n\nThese companies open-source their AI software because they wish to be the foundations on which other people innovate. Any entrepreneur who does so successfully can be bought up and easily integrated into the larger parent. AI is central because it, by design, learns and adapts, and even makes decisions. AI is more than a product: it is a product generator. In the near future, AI will not be relegated to serving up images or consumer products, but will be used to identify and capitalize on new opportunities by innovating new products.\n\nOpen-sourcing AI serves these companies' broader goals of staying at the cutting edge of technology. In this sense, they are not giving away the keys to their success: they are paving the way to their own future.", "Thinking of picking up either the Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge? If you are, don't be surprised if you were to launch your phone and discover two apps missing from the handset. The missing apps are Samsung's music and video player. Instead they have been replaced by Google Play Music and Play Movies.\n\nThis more or less corroborates an earlier rumor which suggested that Samsung would be cleaning up the software on their phones, and presumably they are trying to give users more of a stock Android experience by removing those apps from the phone. However if for whatever reason you prefer Samsung's music or video player apps, you can always go ahead and download them.\n\nThey will be part of the Galaxy Essentials from the Galaxy Store, not the Google Play Store, so you will have to launch a different app store if you'd like to get those apps back. Given that stock Android has been one of the more preferred builds of Android since it is usually quite lag-free as it isn't heavily themed/skinned, this change should appeal to fans of the platform.\n\nAlternatively it is possible that maybe Samsung has decided that there could be more users of Google Play Music than its Samsung Music Player, and have decided to make it easier for its users to access Google's music service.

Which, in fact, was only part one: the second AW16 show will take place in September and will initiate the brand's plans to sell straight from the catwalk. Most of these autumn clothes, seen in February, would be arriving in-store in June and July, and all under the banner of the Burberry brand. The company has now merged its former Prorsum, London and Brit divisions into one and they would very much encourage you to forget they ever existed.\n\nStreamlining a brand can be terribly confusing. Last November, following half-year reports of a 9 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at the house within a \"challenging\" environment, Carol Fairweather, Burberry's finance director, indicated the brand would cut costs by about \u00a320m this year in hiring and expenses. Growth has plateaued for many luxury labels in the wake of the Asian slowdown, with sales becoming sluggish and new markets proving frustratingly unpredictable. Burberry's latest announcement, however, has recast its claim to being one of fashion's most dynamic, responsive and consumer-facing brands. They sound active and engaged, even if ready-to-buy has in practice already been adopted by many in the industry, albeit in a quieter way.\n\n\"It's doing what feels right for our audience,\" explained Christopher Bailey, Burberry chief creative and executive officer of his decision to launch the \"see now buy now\" strategy. \"It wasn't supposed to be a ground shift within the industry. Or even that radical. But we're in an industry which is supposed to embrace change and so this format felt like part of that journey. Burberry were early to digital and it didn't feel right to have invited our audience in [the brand has 38 million social media followers across 19 global platforms, many of whom were following the show on Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram] and then not conform to that.\"\n\nBailey's focus since becoming chief executive in May 2014 has been to simplify the brand's message: from now on there will be only two show collections (showing both men's and women's in each), two seasons and one label. It is a simplification that makes total sense for the Google-generation.\n\nRight brain sorted, how would the creative left compare? As chief creative officer, Bailey's AW16 collection was his loosest yet. In past seasons, his collections have followed fairly straight artistic themes -- Bloomsbury watercolourists, perhaps, or military frogging. This was a m\u00e9lange of different ideas -- and varying price points -- as the designer offered a \"patchwork of the things I really love\". Conveniently enough, the patchwork was stitched together with many of the Burberry codes: tufty blanket coats in its scarf plaids, military outerwear with bold button details, oversized shearlings, duffle coats and parkas and Mitford-sister era gowns. Bailey had drawn on his love of \"musical references\": there were glam rock era shiny metallic lam\u00e9s and lurex tops, technicolour brocades and bright sequinned floral mini-dresses. Snakeskin and patent details patterned outerwear and pockets.\n\nIn view of the fact these clothes would be delivered in store simultaneously \"in very hot and very cold climates\", Bailey had mixed in \"big heavy cashmeres with very light dresses\". The shoes were chunky and stack-heeled and there were smaller bags stitched in a tapestry of coloured skins.\n\nThis collection will inform the next, said Bailey and as such this trans-seasonal offering was the beginning of an emerging line that will be less flexible from one season to the other. It is no easy route Bailey takes. But perhaps that is the irony in simplifying things, you end up having to doing twice as much.", "Actor Charlie Sheen is HIV Positive. He shared his diagnosis on The Today Show on Wednesday morning.\n\nActor Charlie Sheen's bombshell announcement on a US chat show that he was HIV positive may have had a massive public health benefit, research suggests.\n\nAfter his confession on NBC's Today Show on November 17 last year, HIV-related Google searches in the US hit record levels.\n\nThe number of news reports mentioning the AIDS virus also soared.\n\nExperts said the surge in awareness was likely to be a boost for public health.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Charlie Sheen predicted HIV diagnosis in dream\n\n* Charlie Sheen's 'kids are uncomfortable around him'\n\n* Charlie Sheen's full statement on being HIV positive\n\nProfessor John Ayers, from San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health in the US, said: \"Charlie Sheen's disclosure was a potential earth-shaking event for HIV prevention in the United States.\n\n\"While no-one should be forced to reveal their HIV status and all diagnoses are tragic, Sheen's disclosure may benefit public health by potentially helping many learn more about HIV and HIV prevention.\"\n\nSheen, who starred in the popular sitcom Two And A Half Men as well as the movies Wall Street and Platoon, was the highest-paid actor on television in 2010.\n\nBut a year later his life and career were in a tailspin as reports of alcohol and drug abuse, marital problems and mental instability hit the headlines.\n\nHis contract for Two And A Half Men was terminated by CBS and Warner Bros in March 2011.\n\nHis public announcement that he had been diagnosed HIV positive four years earlier caused a sensation.\n\nTo assess its impact, Prof Ayers led a team of researchers who scoured Google search histories and monitored news coverage.\n\nThey found that the day of Sheen's disclosure coincided with a 265 per cent increase in news reports mentioning HIV archived on the Bloomberg Terminal, a computer service providing information to professionals.\n\nAn additional 6500 stories were reported on the Google News website alone.\n\nSheen's appearance on the Today Show also corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searches ever recorded on a single day in the US.\n\nAbout 2.75 million more searches including the term \"HIV\" were made than expected, based on previous trends - a rise of 417 per cent.\n\nIn addition 1.25 million more searches than expected were made that included the terms \"condoms\", \"HIV symptoms\", and \"HIV testing\".\n\nThis was against a background of apparent declining interest in HIV as a health issue.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2015, the rate of news reporting about HIV had reduced from 67 stories per 1000 to just 12, the researchers writing in the journal Jama Internal Medicine said.\n\nHowever Prof Ayers said the public health community appeared not to be making the most of the opportunity offered by Sheen.\n\n\"Sadly, the public health community may be missing the mark,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm unaware of any major HIV educational campaigns that are using Sheen's disclosure for public health outreach.\"", "The decision on which Android smartphone you should be buying has been made a little more complicated by Mobile World Congress (MWC), and we don't just mean which of the new Samsungs to get.\n\nWith its new G5, LG has taken most of us by surprise by going down the modular route - providing users with the option of adding a speaker (made by Bang & Olufsen no less) or a remote to turn the phone into a digital camera. The battery is also removable, so users could swap out a dead one for a fully charged one at a time of need.\n\nThese are head-turning, if not revolutionary ideas, seeing as Google has toyed with modular phones but been unable to get it off the ground. But here the G5 is in the flesh at MWC, so is it worth some hype?\n\nAs a piece of evolution compared to the previous generation G4, the G5 is a big step forward. Gone are the strange and somewhat gimmicky ceramic or leather back covers that, despite being okay in the hand, were not easy on the eye.\n\nThe all-metal body here is sleek, the bezels curving nicely into the rear of the phone. It feels premium, but is surprisingly and refreshingly light in weight. It's only 159g. On first impression then the G5 ticks several of the key boxes.\n\nThere are a range of colours too including pink, silver and gold that all look stylish, and the 'always on' screen is very on-trend too.\n\nMuch like Samsung, LG has also made a real effort to improve its camera this year. Where it has focussed is the scale of images - introducing a wide-angle lens alongside the standard one on the rear of the phone gives users an option when it comes to photos.\n\nThe wide-angle lens is impressive too, and the contrast was stark when placed next to an iPhone- showing just how much the G5 could now get in the shot.\n\nThen there is the modular aspect. It works fairly simply - the bottom panel of the G5, below the screen and where the LG logo sits, can be released and detached from the phone via a discreet button on the side of the device. When you remove it, the phone's 2,800mAh battery comes with it.\n\nFrom here the battery can be removed and replaced by another, or you can add one of the other modules, or LG Friends as the technology giant is calling them.\n\nThe first of which is LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play. This audio player extension adds a second headphone jack to the device, so two of you can listen at once. But crucially, that additional jack can supply high resolution audio playback, upscaling your music to that level in the process.\n\nThe second is LG Cam Plus, a remote that essentially turns your device into a digital camera, adding a physical shutter button so it sits like a camera in your hand. This accessory also adds an extra 1,200mAh battery capacity to the G5.\n\nThe first drawback is that neither of these main accessories match the G5 in any colour, so your phone will most definitely look modular as you use it.\n\nThe other issue lies in the unproven popularity of modular devices. Here, the G5 stands out from other smartphones, but in the wild the question remains as to whether the user would still want to be able to remove their batteries, or swap out for a camera extension. Google's take on this never got going, and perhaps that was for a reason.\n\nWhere LG has also been wildly interesting this MWC is some of the other companion devices to go with the G5.\n\nThe first of which is a fully-fledged robot - the Rolling Bot - designed to be part home security device, part pet-sitter. The Rolling Bot can be controlled remotely via smartphone and used to scan your house, while there's a laser light built in too for pets to chase, as well as a microphone so you can talk to them.\n\nLG has also joined the virtual reality party, introducing 360 VR, its own headset which plugs exclusively into the G5 and uses a single screen for each eye to simulate a 130-inch screen being viewed from two metres away. The image sharpness is impressive, as is the ability to fold up 360 VR and carry it around with it, bringing a new level of mobility to the currently fairly tethered market.", "WhatsApp is one of the largest and most popular messaging services around. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and is the only messenger on Android to actually hit a billion downloads. Additionally, WhatsApp is the only app from Facebook that is not blocked in China.

We also got the ability to use WhatsApp on the desktop, and now we are getting a beta track in Google Play.\n\nA few years ago, Google I/O 2014 to be exact, Google announced beta tracks in Google Play. Essentially what it does is it allows users to sign up to beta test a particular app in a dedicated Google Group or Google+ community. Users in that community, only, are able to check out the beta or alpha version of the app. This limits the testing pool of users as well as giving users and developers a single place to talk about the app. Whether its bugs, or something else. WhatsApp has now joined in, and has made a beta track available for their app.\n\nWhatsApp isn't using a Google Group or Google+ community for their beta testing - since they are a Facebook company they'd rather drive traffic to Facebook than a competing service like Google+. So that takes out one of the steps needed to sign up. All you need to do is head to their Play Store listing, then opt into become a tester. On that page, there is a link to download WhatsApp if you haven't already downloaded it on your smartphone. If you already have it, then within about an hour or so, you will likely see an update to WhatsApp. There's nothing new in there, yet. It's simply getting you on the beta track.\n\nNow before you decide to opt into the beta, it's important to note that beta's do often times have bugs and other issues. So if you are worried about having bugs and such, you'll want to skip this beta.", "Daniel Thomas in Barcelona and Richard Waters in San Francisco\n\nMark Zuckerberg has launched a passionate defence of Free Basics, Facebook's limited free mobile internet service that was banned in India this month, as he promised to continue to push the programme in other developing countries.\n\nTalking publicly about the setback for the first time, the Facebook chief executive on Monday said that the decision by the Indian telecoms regulator to ban the service was \"disappointing for the mission for what we are trying to do, and a major setback in India\".\n\nMr Zuckerberg, who was speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, also rose to the defence of Apple over its refusal to help the FBI break into an iPhone that had belonged to one of the perpetrators of the mass shooting in San Bernardino.\n\n\"I don't think requiring back doors in encryption is either an effective thing to increase security or is the right thing to do,\" he said. His backing for the forceful public position, struck by Apple chief executive Tim Cook, amounted to a stronger personal defence than has been offered by other Silicon Valley leaders in recent days, with Google chief executive Sundar Pichai saying only that the FBI demand \"could be a troubling precedent\" and calling for a \"thoughtful and open discussion\".\n\nFacebook's offer of free mobile data for use with a limited range of online services, including its own, was rejected in India over fears that it would distort open access to the internet. The Free Basics plan led to claims of \"digital colonialism\", with critics claiming that the social networking company was out to build a mass audience in the developing world that would provide the foundation for its next phase of international expansion.\n\nSpeaking on Monday, however, Mr Zuckerberg denied that Free Basics was part of a commercial master plan. He said Facebook was \"not really focused on making money\" as much as trying to connect people to the internet who would otherwise have no access.\n\n\"It's kind of a little funny that to some degree people don't take you at face value on this, but it's really just to get people on the internet,\" Mr Zuckerberg said. \"We just do this as a long-term goal, a long-term investment. A lot of people think that companies don't care about anything other than making money.\"\n\nMr Zuckerberg indicated that Facebook would not seek to revive the free mobile internet service for India. The company had learnt that \"every country is different\", he said, promising to continue to help provide connectivity to India through other means.\n\n\"The models that work in one country may not work in another,\" he said. \"If we can work with different operators and different parts of the [Indian] government, then we will. We take the hits we get, learn from them and try to do better.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion, Mr Zuckerberg also rejected fears that artificial intelligence was becoming too powerful, indicating that the technology was not good enough to match human thought. He said that AI was becoming crucial to a number of areas -- citing healthcare and connected car applications as examples -- but added that \"we are nowhere near understanding how intelligence works; no one actually knows how the human brain works\".\n\nVideo content was as important to Facebook as the shift to mobile in 2011, he said, given the shift on how people were sharing \"what's going on around them\". The role of more powerful mobile networks was key in delivering this, he added, including the development of advanced 5G networks.\n\nBut he rejected arguments by mobile operators that Facebook -- which owns the WhatsApp messaging service -- should be regulated in the same way as a telecoms group given they were \"fundamentally different businesses\".", "The decision on which Android smartphone you should be buying has been made a little more complicated by Mobile World Congress (MWC), and we don't just mean which of the new Samsungs to get.\n\nWith its new G5, LG has taken most of us by surprise by going down the modular route - providing users with the option of adding a speaker (made by Bang & Olufsen no less) or a remote to turn the phone into a digital camera. The battery is also removable, so users could swap out a dead one for a fully charged one at a time of need.\n\nThese are head-turning, if not revolutionary ideas, seeing as Google has toyed with modular phones but been unable to get it off the ground. But here the G5 is in the flesh at MWC, so is it worth some hype?\n\nLooks\n\nAs a piece of evolution compared to the previous generation G4, the G5 is a big step forward. Gone are the strange and somewhat gimmicky ceramic or leather back covers that, despite being okay in the hand, were not easy on the eye.\n\nThe all-metal body here is sleek, the bezels curving nicely into the rear of the phone. It feels premium, but is surprisingly and refreshingly light in weight. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only 159g. On first impression then the G5 ticks several of the key boxes.\n\nThere are a range of colours too including pink, silver and gold that all look stylish, and the \u00e2\u0080\u0098always on\u00e2\u0080\u0099 screen is very on-trend too.\n\nHardware update\n\nMuch like Samsung, LG has also made a real effort to improve its camera this year. Where it has focussed is the scale of images - introducing a wide-angle lens alongside the standard one on the rear of the phone gives users an option when it comes to photos.\n\nThe wide-angle lens is impressive too, and the contrast was stark when placed next to an iPhone- showing just how much the G5 could now get in the shot.\n\nGoing modular\n\nThen there is the modular aspect. It works fairly simply - the bottom panel of the G5, below the screen and where the LG logo sits, can be released and detached from the phone via a discreet button on the side of the device. When you remove it, the phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2,800mAh battery comes with it.\n\nFrom here the battery can be removed and replaced by another, or you can add one of the other modules, or LG Friends as the technology giant is calling them.\n\nThe first of which is LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play. This audio player extension adds a second headphone jack to the device, so two of you can listen at once. But crucially, that additional jack can supply high resolution audio playback, upscaling your music to that level in the process.\n\nThe second is LG Cam Plus, a remote that essentially turns your device into a digital camera, adding a physical shutter button so it sits like a camera in your hand. This accessory also adds an extra 1,200mAh battery capacity to the G5.\n\nThe first drawback is that neither of these main accessories match the G5 in any colour, so your phone will most definitely look modular as you use it.\n\nThe other issue lies in the unproven popularity of modular devices. Here, the G5 stands out from other smartphones, but in the wild the question remains as to whether the user would still want to be able to remove their batteries, or swap out for a camera extension. Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take on this never got going, and perhaps that was for a reason.\n\nOther \u00e2\u0080\u0098Friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhere LG has also been wildly interesting this MWC is some of the other companion devices to go with the G5.\n\nThe first of which is a fully-fledged robot - the Rolling Bot - designed to be part home security device, part pet-sitter. The Rolling Bot can be controlled remotely via smartphone and used to scan your house, while there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a laser light built in too for pets to chase, as well as a microphone so you can talk to them.\n\nLG has also joined the virtual reality party, introducing 360 VR, its own headset which plugs exclusively into the G5 and uses a single screen for each eye to simulate a 130-inch screen being viewed from two metres away. The image sharpness is impressive, as is the ability to fold up 360 VR and carry it around with it, bringing a new level of mobility to the currently fairly tethered market.", "Natasha Alden Full-time traveler, adventurer, and blogger. Living each day out of her backpack.\n\n\"Danke,\" the cashier says to me as I walk away with my groceries from one of the supermarkets in Turkey.\n\nI am not German. And despite the name Natasha, I am not Russian either.\n\nThen I must be the blonde from Scandinavia, Australia, or The Netherlands. Nope, Nope, Nope. I go on to tell them I am from the United States. Usually, the country does not register until I finally just say \"America.\" Most of the time I get a cheerful and friendly response, once in a while I will get resentment. But more often than not I will just get confusion.\n\n\"Wow, Americans never come here,\" or \"Oh, we don't meet many Americans traveling.\"\n\nActually, in a majority of my travels, I have only met a small handful of fellow Americans. Now, maybe I am just staying at the wrong places, but for the most part, I am surrounded by all the other nationalities of the world besides my own.\n\nSo what is it? Why Don't Americans Travel Internationally?\n\nWe have so much to offer in our own country\n\nThis one is easy and is always my first line of defense. The U.S. is one massive country. Not only is it gigantic, but it is diverse. You can literally go from building a snowman in 20\u00b0 weather to sipping pina colada's in the Florida Keys all within a 3-hour flight -- no currency exchanges, no red eye flights.\n\nWe have extremely pricey passports\n\nObtaining a passport isn't exactly cheap. At $135, we have the fifth most expensive passport in the world. That may not seem like a lot to some people, but keep in mind that takes 19 hours of work at minimum wage.\n\nWe are led to believe that international travel is expensive\n\nBeyond that whopping $135 for a passport, international travel can be extremely inexpensive. However, we are shown that traveling is for the rich, and advertisements lead us to believe that travel is for people living the extravagant lifestyle enjoying a private villa in the French Polynesia. The number one question I get asked is \"How can you afford to travel like you do?\" Some research and a visit to the World Wide Web will tell you that travel can be incredibly cheap. Most days, I travel on a budget of less than $35 a day -- and yes that is including parts of Western Europe! Put your purchases on credit cards to rack up airline miles, sleep in hostels, travel during the off-season, or do a work exchange in a foreign country.\n\nWe aren't given vacation time\n\nThe average amount of paid vacation time is two weeks. According to Forbes, the United States is the only advanced economy that does not require employers to provide paid vacation time. To make it worse, Forbes explains that nearly 1-in-4 Americans do not receive any paid vacation or paid holidays. I have friends in France that enjoy more than an entire month of vacation! It's time Americans received the time off that they work for, and deserve.\n\nWe don't use our vacation time\n\nThat's right, the nearly 3-in-4 Americans that do receive paid vacation time fail to even use it! Oh my, are we that committed to work that we can't even take some time to enjoy ourselves? The U.S. Travel Association found that the average American fails to use even five vacation days a year. By not taking these days off, Americans are essentially paying their employer to be at work. The result? America becomes an overworked, overstressed, and ultimately unhealthy society.\n\nWe are in some serious debt\n\nStudents in America are facing a major debt issue. I know many people, and personal friends of mine, that would love to travel, but are so crippled by the enormous amount of debt they acquired pursuing a degree that they simply cannot afford it. Another article by Forbes states that America is suffering from over $1 trillion in student loan debt, surpassing credit card debt. Holy.Cow.\n\nWe think you have to speak the language\n\nThe only language I can speak fluently is English. It's embarrassing and I hate to admit it, but it does get me around the world. I didn't speak Turkish in Turkey, Spanish in Ecuador, or Japanese in Japan (okay, that was a tough one). However, I lived! I did more than just live, I got from point A to point B, I bought things at the grocery store, I even got a great haircut with no common language spoken between me and the stylist. Like a large majority of Americans, I am fortunate enough to be a native speaker of English, the international language. It's always respectful, and fun to learn at least a few words of the language of whatever country you're in, but English is prevalent around the world. If you really can't figure it out, turn to Google.\n\nWe are scared\n\nWe live in a nation of fear. We are just scared, and of what I'm not quite sure. Every time I leave for a trip my parents get nervous for my safety. This is confusing to me considering mass shootings are becoming the daily norm in the U.S. The most notable places I recall being unsafe are in America. In most foreign countries 99 percent of the people are friendly, and just going about their daily lives. The police in the U.K. do not even carry guns, and the first person to be shot and killed by police in Iceland was in 2013. The world is not on the brink of destruction, and never once in the 40-plus countries, I traveled to so far, have I ever felt threatened.\n\nWe are just plain old ignorant\n\nRegardless of facts, there are people that preach nothing but red, white, and blue. I am not knocking my country, for there are many things I love about it; However, we can be an ignorant bunch. The media is partially at fault all, what we see in the U.S. is sensationalized news. World news is only covered if it directly affects us negatively, or is some mass tragedy. When I turn on Al Jazeera, Euro News or BBC News while abroad, I actually see WORLD news. It's embarrassing when I travel and foreigners know the latest American politics, but I couldn't tell you the latest in their home country. There is a serious lack of information about the world affairs in the United States. We seem to be in an isolated bubble, where Americans are afraid of the unknown, or even worse just don't care. I've met Americans that can't locate Australia on a map, warned me not to get sold into sex slavery in Thailand, and come across a few that think Tokyo is the capital of China.", "CloudFlare will set up its own internet domain registrar for wealthy customers who cannot have their websites hijacked.\n\nThe business model of most registrars - the organizations you typically buy domain names from - is based upon volume, ie: selling as many names as possible and making the process as easy as possible to use. That flexibility leaves enough room in domain registration systems for hackers to exploit.\n\nEven high-value domains are mostly still managed by consumer-grade registrars, according to CloudFlare, which says it has \"noticed a rise in domain hijacks over the past few years.\"\n\nThe issue is that anyone with access to the registrar account - such as an attacker or former employee - can take complete control over a domain, and as such could redirect its traffic, alter its web content, hold the domain hostage for a ransom, or even compromise the emails intended for the domain's legitimate owner.\n\nIt is ironic that for large organizations that tend to need six or more people to sign off on a business change, a single username and password pair is all that's needed to login and alter the settings of the corporation's web domains. CloudFlare's registrar intends to make it harder for changes to be made.\n\nMatthew Prince, CloudFlare's CEO, told The Register how \"two and a half years ago, we got a frantic call from the CTO of the New York Times, after a hacking group - attributed to be the Syrian Electronic Army - hacked its registrar, Melbourne IT, and were able to take over the domain of NYTimes.com.\"\n\nThe New York Times' website was replaced with a message written by miscreants, but behind the scenes, according to Prince, \"every email that had been sent to anyone at the New York Times was potentially redirected to a malicious server - a server controlled by this hacking group, and when you're an organization receiving as many sensitive emails as the Times, this is pretty worrisome.\"\n\nAs Prince described it, \"there wasn't a tonne that we could do to help\" in that situation. \"If a hacker compromises your registrar and takes over your domain, they have the keys to the kingdom and can use those to unlock everything. Really, they can take over your entire business,\" said Prince.\n\n\"We set out to become our own registrar to protect our own domains from being hijacked,\" he added, \"and then protect the domains of high-value organisations and customers.\" Prince stressed that \"this isn't for the ten-dollars-a-year crowd,\" but was more of an add-on for those spending \"$5,000 a month\" with CloudFlare.\n\nCloudFlare's registrar will manage web names for its customers, and ensure REGISTRAR-LOCK and REGISTRY-LOCK are available to prevent hackers from moving domains to a different registrar - as well as automatically renewing domains (which even Google doesn't always remember to do), and ensuring DNSSEC is enabled.\n\n\"Intentionally, we're not going after the mass-market,\" said Prince, \"but for the largest customers that really care about keeping control of their domain. The domain is a critical part for organizations that really care about security.\"\n\nRoughly six months ago, ICANN awarded registrar status to CloudFlare. Although the San Francisco biz is the world's 1,910th registrar, it will be \"the first to say 'Let's build this from the ground up to be as secure as possible',\" said Prince.\n\nThat building started with \"implementing a change control process\" that does not attempt to be streamlined or convenient at all costs, nor offer a one-size-fits-all user interface.\n\nInstead, CloudFlare will allow customers to \"specify and build their own change control process ... if an organisation requires six different individuals from six different departments to all email in their changes, and then verify by faxing,\" then CloudFlare will let them do that. \u00ae\n\nDisclosure: El Reg is a customer of CloudFlare and uses its content-distribution network.", "Thanks to the inclusion of the Vulkan APIs, which we have discussed previously when it was first announced Google intended to bring them to Android, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will bring a much better gaming experience than any smartphone previously.\n\nTo sum it up, Vulkan is a next-generation graphics API. It grants app developers more explicit control over scene rendering, providing direct control over GPU acceleration for maximized performance. Vulkan's specific role is the handling of 3D graphics, then distributing the workload over among multiple CPUs. With a firm control over the graphics, your CPU intensive games can be played not only better, but for longer.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are the first smartphones to offer this currently, but Samsung did not stop there. Pre-installed on the devices is an app called Game Launcher. Instead of opening a game via the app icon as you normally would, open up Game Launcher, choose whether you want to block specific app notifications or enable Game Tools, and then open your game via the selection inside of Game Launcher.\n\nWhen enabled, Game Launcher brings specific tools to your disposal, such as the ability to record gameplay, lock the Recent and Back keys to keep you from accidentally backing out of the game and losing your place, take screenshots, scores and rankings, and more. Users can also specify power-saving options.\n\nThe below video gives a great overview of what Game Launcher does on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.\n\nIf you don't plan on picking up a Galaxy S7, don't worry, Vulkan will likely be making its way to many more smartphones hitting the market this year.", "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is leading a national effort to teach tech skills to the next generation of students.\n\nBut making computer science an integral part of basic education starts with having the right teachers. Governor Inslee promised to make that one of his top priorities in the coming year, during a meeting of the National Governors Association in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Not all teachers grew up in this particular age of coding,\" Inslee said. \"We are 7,000 teachers short in my state and when we work to decrease the teacher shortage this is going to be an important part of that.\"\n\nInslee has announced that he will be leading a coalition of government and business groups, encouraging all states to create and implement a computer science curriculum.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is asking congress for $4.1 billion to support computer science in all K-12 classrooms.\n\nIn addition to filling jobs and creating a highly skilled workforce, Inslee said having a generation that is proficient in new technology is imperative for our safety.\n\n\"I was at Google in Kirkland the other day, and they're rolling out their autonomous vehicles. When we're in autonomous vehicles, we want to make sure people know how to code when they develop those cars,\" Inslee said with a laugh.\n\nBut, Margo Day, Vice President of Education at Microsoft, said computer science is about more than just coding. It teaches children teamwork and problem-solving skills.\n\n\"Thinking about how to code, to solve problems, lights up their creativity,\" said Day.\n\nAlthough 90 percent of parents surveyed say they want computer science taught in the classroom, only about 25 percent of public schools currently offer this type of instruction.\n\nMegan Smith, the U.S. Chief Technology Director, noted that computer science jobs aren't only found at Microsoft and Google. They're in every state and in every industry.\n\n\"The 600,000 jobs that are open in the United States right now are in every sector,\" Smith said. \"They're in retail. They're in agriculture. They're in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe governors joining the Partnership for K-12 Computer Science have three main objectives:\n\n* Enable all high schools to offer at least one rigorous computer science course. * Fund professional learning opportunities so educators can prepare to teach these courses. * Create a set of high-quality academic K-12 computer science standards\n\nGovernor Inslee said it will also be important that states share information with each other and with industry experts.\n\n\"We've signed a $2 million program to scale up our computer science programs just last year and start the process of creating a real curriculum for schools across the state,\" Inslee said. \"And, it's happened because we've had very vigorous public-private partnerships.\"\n\nCode.org is also a driving force behind this effort. They will be providing the interstate partnership with resources as the states work to create computer science programs. They will also be working to facilitate collaboration among lawmakers from different states.", "Google Fiber has certainly made its way across various places in the US, and Austin, Texas is one of them, having its pricing revealed in November 2014 before it went live a few days after the price was revealed to the masses. However, not everyone is too happy with the way in which Google Fiber was installed in the area. As Google started to install the infrastructure in order to deliver high-speed Internet service to the area, and hundreds of Austin residents have already accused Google Fiber of causing excessive damage and congestion - mainly due to Google's contractors, of course.\n\nThose living on Lambs Lane in Southeast Austin are not too fond of the words \"Google Fiber\", where residents there claim that Google and its contractors have left construction eyesores in the area, while materials left behind was deemed to have blocked a number of storm drains. Other residents remember how on October 30th, a couple of feet of water rushed into their home, flooding it along the way.\n\n254 out of 363 complaints alone that were connected to Google Fiber's construction and installation activity were filed last year with Austin's 3-1-1 services. Some of the complaints include home, landscape and lawn damage, trespassing and other kinds of disruptions, including trucks that block private driveways.

The company, which began back in 2009, already offers its sleep-saving service for Mac, PC, Linux and jailbroken iOS devices, but until recently it wasn't available for Google's massively popular mobile operating system.\n\nTo try out the beta you'll need a rooted Android phone. Then sign up for a F.lux forum account and request to join the test group.

However, Twilight simply applies a red filter on top, while F.lux actually removes the blue light from each individual pixel.\n\nThe team behind F.lux previously said it wasn't possible to implement its technology on Android, but it sounds like the company may have found a solution.

The company has provided app developers with a start guide and the ability to add EarlGrey to their projects using CocoaPods or to add it manually to Xcode project files.\n\nReleasing EarlGrey as open source is a positive move that follows considerable efforts by Google in various open source communities, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT.\n\n\"It simplifies iOS development tasks. Overall, it should be a welcome addition to iOS developers' toolboxes,\" he told LinuxInsider.\n\nOne of the main advantages to EarlGrey is its synchronization ability, noted Google's Janga. The tests automatically wait for animations, network requests and other events before interacting with the UI. That makes it easier for app developers to write tests without sleep or wait states and to maintain a procedural description of test steps.\n\nTwo other factors -- visibility checking and design flexibility -- enhance the testing process on the iOS platform.\n\nVisibility checking during tests takes into account the user experience with an app. It ensures, for example, that attempting to tap a button hidden behind an image will flag an immediate failure, Janga said.\n\nDesign components involving element selection, interaction, assertion and synchronization take future growth into consideration.\n\n\"Apple is not known for its development tools, so this should make it easier for them to develop iOS apps,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group.\n\n\"However, over time, they will be more and more dependent on Alphabet, and Android has not proven as lucrative as iOS has, so strategically, flipping to Alphabet's tools could be ill advised,\" he told LinuxInsider.\n\nOpen sourcing any technology tends to accelerate product improvements and find potential problems, noted King. Doing so with EarlGrey will allow Google developers to focus on other critical tasks.\n\n\"It also somewhat enhances Google's position in open source by showing that the company can and does play nice with Apple-related technologies,\" he said.\n\nGoogle's move is a throwback to how Microsoft got a grip on software developers early in its growth, according to Enderle. It's \"a very Microsoft-like play\" and the kind of thing it did in the 1980s and early 1990s in going after developers.\n\n\"If you can own them, you can take control of the platform,\" he said. \"Google gets broader adoption and begins to erode Apple's control over iOS.

Several months ago Google acquired Jibe, a company that prioritized implementing this technology on modern phones, and now the tech giant along with a bunch of carriers around the globe are announcing an initiative to accelerate adoption.\n\nRead More\n\nCarriers Around The World And Google Announce Initiative To Speed Up Adoption Of Rich Communication Services (RCS) was written by the awesome team at Android Police.\n\nfrom Android Police - Android News, Apps, Games, Phones, Tablets http://ift.tt/21lTB0O", "BARCELONA, Spain -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed Monday to press on with his 3-year-old effort to bring the developing world online, even after Indian regulators banned one of the pillars of the campaign.\n\nHe said the banned service, Free Basics, was only one program in his Internet.org campaign, so he could proceed with other initiatives. Indian regulators banned Free Basics this month because it provided access only to certain pre-approved services -- including Facebook -- rather than the full Internet.\n\n\"Facebook isn't a company that hits a roadblock and gives up,\" Zuckerberg said at the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain. \"We take the hits and try to get better.\"\n\nThough Zuckerberg termed the regulatory defeat \"disappointing for the mission and a major setback,\" he said every country was different, and \"the model that has worked in one country may not work in another.\"\n\nThis was his third appearance at the Barcelona show to promote Internet access to everyone in the world. He has argued that online connections can improve lives and fuel economic development.\n\nTo achieve that goal, Zuckerberg has high-flying dreams for someday providing Internet connections through a network of drones, satellites and lasers. Zuckerberg said Monday that Internet.org would launch its first satellite over Africa this year and \"we are about to test flying Internet drone solar planes that can fly three months a year.\"\n\nWhile the drones may someday connect people in areas too remote for cables or cell towers, Free Basics is intended for people who live in areas with Internet service but still can't afford it. Facebook works with wireless carriers in poorer nations to let people use streamlined versions of Facebook and certain other online services, without paying data charges.\n\nA low-income resident of urban Manila, for example, can use Free Basics to view the Philippines' GMA News site. \"He can be informed. He can research. He can read the news,\" Ederic Eder of GMA News said.\n\nThe program varies by country, in offerings and effectiveness.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, Facebook partnered with the third-largest wireless carrier, Cell C. But Johannesburg resident Priscilla de Klerk said she couldn't get Free Basics to work on her phone.\n\n\"Cell C is much cheaper as far as everything else is concerned, but their free Facebook is not a reality,\" she said.\n\nLast fall, Facebook announced a major expansion in Africa, where another regional carrier, Bharti Airtel, said it will offer Free Basics in 17 countries.\n\n\"They're getting a lot of traction in Africa,\" said Danson Njue, a Kenya-based telecom analyst with the Ovum research firm. Tech rivals Google and Microsoft also have programs to expand Internet access, he noted, but their approaches are content neutral and involve extending networks to underserved areas.\n\nFacebook doesn't pay wireless companies for the cost of Free Basics. Carriers make money if new users eventually move to a paid data plan. Facebook also says it makes no money, as it doesn't show ads, though Zuckerberg has conceded it benefits from gaining users in the long run.\n\nWhile the company hasn't released detailed usage figures, Facebook says Free Basics has brought more than 19 million people online for the first time. That counts any user who didn't have Internet access before, regardless of whether they're currently active.\n\nOn the Internet.org website, mixed in with videos about impoverished students using Free Basics to study and laborers starting small businesses, Facebook boasts more than 1 billion people \"have access\" to the service. That's the combined population of regions where it's available, not the number of users.\n\nFree Basics is now in 36 countries. It was suspended last year in Egypt, on the anniversary of anti-government protests that were organized partly on Facebook. An earlier version of Free Basics, known as Facebook Zero, was shuttered three years ago in Chile, after authorities said Internet providers couldn't offer discounts for accessing some content but not others.\n\nSimilar concerns turned India into the program's biggest battleground.\n\nFree Basics enrolled more than 1 million Indians in its first year, according to Facebook's wireless partner, Reliance Communications. But critics, including many in the country's growing tech community, complained it was a predatory scheme: If low-income users couldn't afford anything besides Free Basics, opponents said, that meant Facebook was deciding which online services the nation's poor could use.\n\n\"The government should not allow big players to monopolize the Internet,\" said Manu Sharma, who runs a software development company in New Delhi.\n\nFacebook responded last fall by announcing it would open Free Basics to any app that met its technical requirements for systems with limited capacity. Zuckerberg also changed the program's name to Free Basics, after critics complained \"Internet.org\" sounded like a nonprofit, when it's part of a for-profit company (the overall campaign is still called Internet.org).\n\nBut opponents still worry that Facebook could change requirements at any time, force competitors to pay higher rates to get into the program, or even block services that run afoul of powerful politicians.\n\n\"The fact that it could decide what apps could be hosted ... was a huge problem for me,\" said Basit Zaidi, a New Delhi attorney.\n\nAs Indian regulators began studying the issue, Facebook drew more resentment with a public-relations blitz that critics called heavy-handed and patronizing. The regulators effectively banned Free Basics after concluding Internet providers shouldn't be allowed to charge different rates for certain services, because that discriminates against other content.\n\nU.S. regulators have endorsed the concept of \"net neutrality,\" which says all websites and apps should be treated equally by Internet providers. They're now studying whether \"zero rating\" programs, which offer some content for free, should be allowed. Net neutrality supporters are hoping India's decision will influence other nations.\n\nFacebook has also launched a program that helps Internet providers offer reliable Wi-Fi service in underserved areas at affordable rates and without limits on content. The program's been limited to tests in a few countries.\n\nThe giant tech company could use its resources and clout with carriers to offer a similar wireless service, perhaps at limited speeds or volume, but without any restrictions on content, said Josh Levy of Access Now, a nonprofit that supports net neutrality. Zuckerberg has suggested in the past that such a service would be too expensive and difficult to offer.\n\nSome Indians, meanwhile, say their country could have benefited from Free Basics.\n\n\"Ultimately, something is better than nothing, even if that something is flawed,\" said Uday Singh Tomar, a software engineer in New Delhi. \"If a person is hungry and getting nothing, a free meal is good enough.\""]}, "Allianz": {"2016-02-19": ["CIMB could fetch about US$200 million (RM842 million) from the deal.

In 2009, the U.K.'s Legal & General LGGNY -1.64 % had to slash its dividend after taking charges against mark-to-market losses on its bonds, where it held lots of junior bank debt.\n\nSuch fears are back, even if Legal & General earlier this month tried to calm fears by showing that just 5% of its huge bond portfolio is oil and gas related and mostly investment grade, less than it is to banks. And market mayhem has come at just the wrong time for European insurers.\n\nThey are moving to a new capital regime known as Solvency II, which forces them to mark assets and liabilities to market prices. As Germany's Allianz ALIZF 0.61 % demonstrated Friday, that can heighten dividend concerns.\n\nThe regime was already expected to make insurers' capital more of a moving target: the amount of equity a company has will go up and down as the values of its assets and liabilities change. When markets are more volatile, insurers' capital becomes harder to understand and predict.\n\nENLARGE\n\nU.K. insurers should have more stable capital than European rivals. This is because the U.K., due to sizable annuities businesses, won a concession under the new rules that allows them to more closely match the value of their assets and liabilities. Both should go up and down more or less in tandem, so their equity shouldn't change very much.\n\nIn contrast, French insurer Axa expects much more volatility and is targeting a wide range in capital levels: from as low as 170% of its minimum requirement up to 230%.\n\nMarket turmoil hurts. Indeed, Allianz shares sank Friday after it said January's market volatility would have cut its solvency ratio to 180% to 190% of its requirement, without any management action. That is within its target range but down from 200% at year's end.\n\nAllianz has said it would reconsider its payout policy if its solvency ratio hit 160%. Meanwhile, the company's dividend yield has climbed above 6% this month, approaching a four-year high, up from under 5% in December.\n\nGiven what finance chief Dieter Wemmer calls a \"perfect storm\" so far this year, the potential for further pain from falling equities, lower interest rates or wider bond spreads is clear.\n\nThis raises other concerns. Management teams can shore up capital, say by shifting away from equities, reducing credit risk or buying longer-dated assets. But such moves could also hurt investment returns and therefore profitability, on top of the direct hit from falling asset values in life insurance and asset-management businesses. Allianz sent a cautious message in setting its 2016 guidance for operating profit.\n\nAs long as the markets remain out of kilter, insurers and their investors will struggle to keep their own balance.\n\nWrite to Paul J.

Pimco will focus closely on costs this year.", "Allianz issued a cautious forecast for the year ahead after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell marginally short of analysts' expectations.\n\nSince the financial crisis, insurers have been battling with low growth and rock-bottom interest rates, which make it hard for them to earn the investment returns they need to cover claims. On top of this, they now face greater market volatility following the recent panic over Europe's banking sector.\n\nIn the three months to the end of December, Allianz, the world's largest insurer, reported a net profit of \u20ac1.5bn, up from \u20ac1.3bn in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected \u20ac1.54bn.\n\nFor the year as a whole, the German insurer's net profits rose 5.8 per cent to \u20ac6.99bn, while its revenues ticked up 2.4 per cent to \u20ac125.2bn.\n\nOliver B\u00e4te, who took over as chief executive in May, said that the results showed the group was \"healthy and well-diversified\". But he forecast that the group would \"generate \u20ac10.5bn in operating profit in 2016, plus or minus \u20ac500m\" -- barely higher than the \u20ac10.7bn in operating profit that Allianz managed last year.\n\nFarooq Hanif, an analyst at Citigroup, said that this was \"disappointing\", while analysts at RBC pointed out that the implied growth was slower than under the three-year plan that Mr B\u00e4te set out in the autumn, which aimed for 5 per cent annual growth in earnings per share.\n\n\"We believe that the plan will still be delivered, however it will clearly be more back end loaded with greater growth in earnings coming in later years,\" they wrote.\n\nAllianz may look to supplement its organic growth with acquisitions. Earlier this month it announced that it would acquire Rogge Global Partners, a fixed- income investment manager. Chief financial officer Dieter Wemmer told the Financial Times that the company would be interested in other deals in asset management and in property and casualty insurance.\n\nTogether with a lower than expected dividend -- Allianz plans to pay out \u20ac7.30 per share, whereas analysts had expected \u20ac7.40 -- the cautious forecast weighed on Allianz's shares, which were down 1.8 per cent at \u20ac133.25 in mid-afternoon trading in Frankfurt.\n\nAllianz's property and casualty business, its biggest division, reported operating profits of \u20ac1.2bn in the final three months of the year, up 8.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Nevertheless, Allianz said that there had been a higher level of natural catastrophe losses, and more large losses than there had been in the previous year.\n\nIts life and health insurance business, which has been the part of the group most affected by rock-bottom interest rates, managed a 63.7 per cent jump to \u20ac1.1bn, mainly because of a better investment margin in the US and higher realised gains in Allianz's German life business.\n\nAllianz's asset management division, which houses the US bond group Pimco, reported an increase in operating profits of \u20ac637m in the fourth quarter, up 8.2 per cent from the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nHowever, for the year as a whole, operating profit at the division -- which was thrown into a state of upheaval by the abrupt departure of Pimco's founder, Bill Gross in 2014 -- fell 11.8 per cent.\n\nDuring that time investors pulled \u20ac125bn from Pimco. However, Allianz stressed that the outflows at Pimco -- which stood at \u20ac11.4bn in the fourth quarter -- were slowing, and added that Allianz Global Investors had recorded inflows for the 12th consecutive quarter.", "* Allianz down after earnings, dividend miss (Adds quote, detail)\n\nBy Danilo Masoni and Alistair Smout\n\nMILAN/LONDON, Feb 19 European shares turned lower on Friday, hit by a drop in bank, oil and auto shares, as investors locked in gains following a strong week that has helped to stabilise markets after a tumultuous start to the year.\n\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1.3 percent at 1,276.78 points by mid-afternoon but still up 3.6 percent since Monday, and set for its best week since October 2015.\n\nThe index has been buoyed by gains in bank and energy stocks after a tough start to the year, and the sectors saw profit-taking on Friday.\n\n\"We were due a recovery, as the markets were oversold... but the underlying story hasn't really changed, and people don't want to take risks heading into the weekend,\" said Mike McCudden, head of retail derivatives at Interactive Investor.\n\n\"There is still a stand-off between oil-producing parties, and the concerns over the banks have not gone away.\"\n\nThe biggest sectoral faller was banks, down 2.4 percent.

So on the 3rd of December we were \u00a393m better off than we were on the 31st December. So you can see the scale of the hit we've taken through the weather - that's the principal driver really.\"\n\nDye pointed out that the storms aside the insurer would have matched 2014's overall performance.\n\nOnce everything has been factored through he doesn't expect the weather losses to be more than \u00a35m higher or lower than \u00a393m.\n\nHe explained that the marginal 0.4% deterioration in COR excluding the effect of the storms, can be put down to the impact of commercial losses and their private car book.\n\nThe CEO cited extremely competitive conditions in both commercial and retail markets caused in large part by the industry following an unsustainable pricing strategy for years when it comes to large loss events such as weather.\n\n\"I'm sure everybody is looking at 'how good was our flood underwriting, how good is the price that we got for flood - was that or was that not adequate?'. And we will certainly be reviewing that.\"\n\nBrexit\n\nTurning his attention to the possibility of Brexit, Dye said: \"The group position here is we think that the UK remaining within Europe is a good thing.\"\n\nThe CEO added: \"In terms of contingency planning Allianz already owns plenty of businesses outside the Eurozone - so we have businesses in the US, we have businesses in Australia, Asia, lots of places that are outside the Eurozone.\n\n\"So if the UK were to find itself outside of the Eurozone, then we would continue in the same way as many of sister companies currently continue outside of Europe.\"", "Insurer shrunk private motor book in 2015 because of poor profitability\n\nChancellor George Osborne's plan to move away from cash compensation for whiplash claims will create \"volatility\" in the private motor insurance market, according to Allianz UK chief executive Jon Dye.\n\nOsborne unveiled his plans in the Autumn Statement in November last year. The plans, which received a warm welcome from the insurance industry, will be consulted on this year.\n\nSpeaking to journalists following the release of Allianz UK's full-year results this morning, Dye likened the impact of the proposed reforms to the industry's response to the introduction of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders act 2012 (Laspo), which came into effect in April 2013.\n\nHe said: \"As we saw with Laspo, [the proposed reforms] will create uncertainty. It creates room for different carriers to take different views on the savings that are available, and we'll have to see how all that plays through.\n\n\"It will create volatility, and in the meantime you would imagine that with the possibility of the whole regime changing at some stage in the future, claims management companies are going to be out there working very hard while the model is still there for them to work. All of that is going to create a lot of uncertainty in private car.\"\n\nAllianz reported a 71% drop in profit and a combined operating ratio (COR) of 102.6% after incurring a \u00a393m claims bill from the December storms.\n\nDye admitted that this was the first time Allianz UK's COR had been above 100% in more than a decade.\n\nThe storms added 4.6 percentage points to the insurer's COR. Without the claims, the COR would have been a profitable 98% - broadly in line with the 97.6% it reported in 2014.\n\nDye said that the high 2015 COR did not concern him because it was clear that the main reason was the large storm claim bill.\n\nIn addition to the storms, Allianz UK's 2015 underwriting profitability was also hit by some large commercial claims in the fourth quarter and claims inflation in its personal motor book, which the company has sought to address throughout 2015 with price increases.\n\nDye said that as a result of the difficulties, Allianz has shrunk its private motor book.\n\nHe said: \"In private car in each of our distribution channels we had fewer policies at the end of the year than we had at the start. That's simply a function of the profitability that we are seeing in that part of the market.\"\n\nBut he added that the price increases put through in 2015 should help improve private motor profitability.\n\nHe said: \"I imagine in 2016, as the rate increases we have put through earn through, we are going to see an improved result there for sure.\"", "Friday, 19 February 2016 (7 hours ago)\n\nAllianz SE, Europe's biggest insurer, said fourth-quarter profit rose 16 percent, missing analyst estimates, on claims from natural catastrophes.

Group third-party net outflows fell to 8 billion euros [$8.8 billion] in the fourth quarter compared with outflows of 141 billion euros [$155.2 billion] a year earlier. Outflows at PIMCO dropped by almost half last year while the Global Investors unit saw record inflows.\n\nAllianz's full-year operating profit rose 3.2 percent to 10.7 billion euros [$11.8 billion]. That compares to a target of 10 billion euros [$11 billion] to 10.8 billion euros [$11.9 billion]. For 2016, the company aims for 10 billion euros [$11 billion] to 11 billion euros [$12.1 billion]. Fourth-quarter operating profit was affected by claims from European storms and floods, the company said Friday.\n\n\"Claims have had a stronger impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter,'' said Roland Pfaender, an analyst at Oddo Seydler Bank AG in Frankfurt, who has a buy rating on the stock. \"The operating profit outlook is disappointing as it has been increased only little and the range has been been widened as a tribute to volatile markets.''\n\nThe property and casualty insurance unit's spending on claims and other costs as a percentage of premiums, known as the combined ratio, improved to 96.2 percent from 96.5 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of 94.4 percent. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer is making a profit from underwriting.\n\nAllianz paid 738 million euros [$812.3 million] for natural catastrophe losses last year, compared to a year-earlier bill of 400 million euros [$440.3 million]. The net loss related to European storms and floods in December was 163 million euros, of which the U.K. accounted for 102 million euros [$112.3 million].\n\nThe stock has fallen 19.5 percent in Frankfurt this year, valuing the company at about 60 billion euros.

For the full-year, net profit rose 6.3% to EUR6.62 billion.\n\nAllianz said fourth-quarter investment returns improved at its insurance business. It also wrote more profitable insurance policies, while performance fees at Pimco rose, all more than compensating for a higher tax bill. Still, the fourth-quarter performance was below market expectations.\n\nThe value of the group's assets under management declined.\n\nThe insurance group said it expects to notch up operating profit, its preferred performance measure, to a range of EUR10 billion ($11 billion) and EUR11 billion this year compared with EUR10.74 billion in 2015, itself a gain of 3.2% from EUR10.4 billion in 2014.\n\n\"Strong performance in our insurance operations plus performance fees in asset management in the fourth quarter drove full-year operating profit close to the top of the target earnings range of EUR10.8 billion,\" said Chief Financial Officer Dieter Wemmer.\n\nHowever, the group said its profit outlook for this year reflected \"higher uncertainty.\"\n\nEurope's insurers and banks are grappling with tougher regulations and low or negative interest rates in much of the region. They are putting pressure on finances and squeezing profit margins amid volatile financial markets, with investors jittery about the prospects for global economic growth.\n\nEurope's biggest insurer by market value said it would pay a dividend of EUR7.30 a share for 2015, up from EUR6.85 for 2014.

Investors were also counting on a higher dividend of at least EUR7.40 a share, he said.\n\nIn the current difficult environment, we must keep our powder dry,\" said Chief Executive Oliver Baete who took the helm in May. Volatile capital markets and zero interest rates pose the biggest uncertainty this year, he said.\n\nIn 2016, Allianz's asset management operations will remain in focus, he said. The business includes bond-fund manager Pimco and smaller peer Allianz Global Investors.\n\nWhile Pimco's net asset outflows eased in the course of the year, its \"profitability [needs] to be improved\" this year, Mr. Baete said.\n\nAsset management only made a slightly higher profit contribution in the final quarter of 2015 while profits declined in the three previous quarters. In the final quarter, the unit's operating profit rose 8.2% to EUR637 million from EUR588 million, helped by the strong U.S. dollar and higher investment returns, which resulted in higher performance fees that especially Pimco received from its customers. But Pimco's costs compared with revenues also rose in the final quarter.\n\nPimco has been high on radar screens ever since it became a burden on Allianz's earnings following a management shake-up two years ago. This culminated in the abrupt departure of Bill Gross, Pimco's co-founder and chief investment officer at the end of September 2014.\n\nFor five consecutive quarters following Mr. Gross's exit, Pimco's substantial net asset outflows have weighed on group results, although outflows peaked in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to data by investment research firm Morningstar Inc.\n\nEven for Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund one can't give the all-clear. In January, the fund, which lost its crown as the world's biggest bond fund last year, had net outflows of $1.1 billion, according to Pimco. In December, the fund logged the first month of net inflows in December in 31 months, when counting capital gains reinvestments as inflows, according to Pimco's own calculation. According to that calculation, the fund had $1.3 billion in net inflows in December.\n\nPimco didn't say whether the fund had net outflows or net inflows in December without the capital gains reinvestments.\n\nAccording to monthly calculations by investment research firm Morningstar Inc., the fund continued to have net outflows, of $1.4 billion in December, when excluding year-end capital gains.\n\nWrite to Ulrike Dauer at ulrike.dauer@wsj.com\n\nContinue Reading Below", "The insurance business has been a reliable cash cow for decades. \"You, the client, pay we, the insurers, large sums of money,\" diminutive British comedian Ronnie Corbett once said. \"That's it.\"\n\nThat's not quite enough to excite investors these days. Big insurers such as Germany's Allianz -- which disappointed the market with quarterly results on Friday -- have become lumbering giants, delivering fistfuls of dividends and tidy profit but suffering from tepid growth and cost pressures. Most worrying is that those dividends might not be quite as rich in future if financial-market turbulence and pressure to boost capital under the Solvency II regime keeps intensifying.\n\nBut even taking into account the threats, the current wave of investor disappointment about the sector seems excessive. Allianz shares have fallen 15 percent so far this year: worse than peers, worse than the broader market and not that much better than the banks. The stock was one of Europe's weakest performers on Friday, falling about 3 percent despite a set of results that admittedly didn't have too much bang, but delivered plenty of bucks.\n\nA raised dividend, increased operating profit and a Solvency II capital ratio of 200 percent -- only very slightly below the sector average -- elicited the financial-market equivalent of a shrug, despite a balance sheet that can clearly support an above-average dividend yield of 5.4 percent.\n\nNow of course, it wasn't all good news. Allianz's combined ratio, a key metric tracking underlying profitability that measures the cost of claims versus income, ticked higher in the fourth quarter. Maybe that's a sign of price pressure. The insurer's forecast for 2016 also cited \"higher uncertainty\" and targeted about 10.5 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in operating profit -- essentially flat on 2015. If 2015 is as good as it gets, the worry is that there are more risks than rewards ahead.\n\nBut if market storms are brewing, is Allianz really such a bad place to be? Even on the combined ratio, it still compares well with peers.\n\nIts capital position looks solid too: JPMorgan analysts say it can absorb the risk of more market turmoil while still delivering on dividends. And it has a strong and expanding foothold in asset management, an area insurers want to dominate as negative interest rates push investors into higher-yielding products. The outflows from Allianz's Pimco after star fund manager Bill Gross's departure have been all but staunched. Allianz has also bought a UK fixed-income boutique from Old Mutual.\n\nWhat investors really wanted was a nice surprise, but there was no insurer jumping out of a cake with a check. While rival Aegon dazzled investors with a 400 million-euro buyback, Allianz steered clear of any such immediate juice to earnings per share, sticking to its stolid 5 percent annual growth plan for EPS. While the insurer has plenty of dry powder for acquisitions, saying its M&A budget might rise to 3 billion euros this year, there seemed to be little fresh insight on Friday about how it might boost growth.\n\nAllianz trades on a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.1 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.0. Both are below the median of peers, according to Bloomberg data. The stock's priced for imperfection.

FISCHAPARK is a shopping centre in Wiener Neustadt in the Austrian region of Lower Austria. FISCHAPARK is currently solely controlled by SPAR. SPAR is mainly active in food retail and in the real estate sector in Austria and neighbouring countries. Allianz is an international insurance and financial services provider. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns, because of the negligible overlap between Allianz's and SPAR's activities as regards the letting of real estate space. The transaction was examined under the simplified merger review procedure.

SIX Paynet is currently solely owned by SIX Group and provides services in the context of electronic invoicing, electronic payments and related services. The Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns because SIX Paynet has limited activities in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the companies have a moderate combined position in the market where their activities overlap.

Mediaset said it was not in talks with Vivendi over a sale.\n\nToday's European research round-up ($1 = 0.6984 pounds) (Reporting by Danilo Masoni, editing by Larry King)", "MUNICH: Allianz SE missed analyst estimates for fourth-quarter profit because of claims from natural catastrophes.\n\nNet income at Europe's biggest insurer increased to 1.42 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in the quarter from 1.22 billion euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said in a statement Friday. That compares with the 1.56 billion-euro average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The insurer's shares fell almost 4 per cent and were trading at 131 euros at 9.24am in Frankfurt.\n\n\"Allianz steadily delivers strong results in increasingly challenging operating conditions,\" Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete, 50, said in the statement. \"Our business is healthy and well-diversified. This makes us confident that we will continue to deliver strong earnings.\"\n\nInsurers in Europe are grappling with stricter regulatory capital requirements, low interest rates that hurt their investment income and subdued prices in some of their markets. Still, Allianz is seeking to achieve annual earnings per share growth of 5 per cent on average from 2016 to 2018. It is also targeting a return on equity of 13 per cent, adjusted to exclude unrealised capital gains on bonds and other items, by 2018.\n\nAllianz plans to increase its dividend by 6.6 per cent to 7.30 euros a share for 2015. That's less than the Bloomberg Dividend Forecast of 7.40 euros.\n\nSome analysts had expected Allianz to announce a share buy-back on top of the dividend to help it reach its return on equity and earnings per share targets. The company hasn't discussed either of those strategies, Chief Financial Officer Dieter Wemmer said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\"We want to deliver 15 per cent EPS growth over three years,\" he said. \"There might be opportunities in the market, there might be excess capital to be given back to shareholders.\"\n\nThe insurer's asset management unit, which comprises Pacific Investment Management Co. and Allianz Global Investors, has seen upheaval after the departure of Bill Gross from Pimco in September 2014. Group third-party net outflows fell to 8 billion euros in the fourth quarter, compared with outflows of 141 billion euros a year earlier. Outflows at Pimco dropped by almost half last year while the Global Investors unit saw record inflows.\n\nAllianz's full-year operating profit rose 3.2 per cent to 10.7 billion euros. That compares to a target of 10 billion euros to 10.8 billion euros. For 2016, the company aims for 10 billion euros to 11 billion euros. Fourth-quarter operating profit was impacted by claims from European storms and floods, the company said Friday.\n\n\"Claims have had a stronger impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter,'' said Roland Pfaender, an analyst at Oddo Seydler Bank AG in Frankfurt, who has a buy rating on the stock. \"The operating profit outlook is disappointing as it has been increased only little and the range has been widened as a tribute to volatile markets.''\n\nThe property and casualty insurance unit's spending on claims and other costs as a percentage of premiums, known as the combined ratio, improved to 96.2 per cent from 96.5 per cent, missing the average analyst estimate of 94.4 per cent. A ratio below 100 per cent means an insurer is making a profit from underwriting.\n\nThe stock has fallen 19.5 per cent in Frankfurt this year, valuing the company at about 60 billion euros. The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index declined 16 per cent over the same time.", "European shares fall away at the end of a strong week\n\nBy Reuters\n\nPublished: 11:56 GMT, 19 February 2016 | Updated: 11:56 GMT, 19 February 2016\n\nBy Danilo Masoni and Alistair Smout\n\nMILAN/LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - European shares turned lower on Friday, hit by a drop in auto shares, as investors locked in gains following a strong week that has helped to stabilise markets after a tumultuous start to the year.\n\nThe biggest losers were auto shares, down 1.3 percent, with scandal-hit Volkswagen under pressure again.

The willingness of debt investors to effectively pay governments to borrow also reflects increasing skepticism of central bank policies -- and concern those very measures may ultimately do more harm than good to the global economy. Even after central banks around the world spent trillions since the financial crisis on quantitative easing and dropped policy rates below zero for about two dozen countries, the market's outlook for inflation globally is closing in on post-financial crisis lows.\n\nWhile the trade-off of losing a little money for the security of owning government debt when things seem so gloomy might be a small one for conservative investors, there are considerable risks in the meantime.\n\nLast year, fears of deflation and the ECB's introduction of QE pushed the average yield on euro-area debt to a record-low 0.475 percent and sent those on German bunds toward zero. Then, in the months that followed, faint glimmers of optimism over the outlook the region's economy helped spark a sudden and violent reversal that caused yields to soar.\n\nBy the middle of June, yields on longer-term German debt jumped more than a percentage point and left investors with an unprecedented 13 percent loss in the quarter, index data compiled by Bank of America Corp. show.\n\nNevertheless, as worries over the economic health of China and the United States -- the world's two main engines of growth -- continue to linger, volatility increases throughout financial markets and investors question the wisdom of negative rates, government bonds with ultra-low yields remain in demand.\n\nThis month, yields on Germany's two-year notes dropped to a record-low minus 0.557 percent. They were at minus 0.54 percent at 7:50 a.m. in London on Monday. The average yield on 1.06 trillion euros of German debt is currently minus 0.05 percent and has been negative every day for two weeks, according to Bank of America. In Japan, yields on about $4.5 trillion of government debt are less than zero, index data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nLast week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its 2016 global growth forecast to 3 percent from 3.3 percent in November, saying \"financial stability risks are substantial.\"\n\nA majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey also say negative rates will be in place at the ECB until at least the first quarter of 2018 and at the BOJ until at least the end of that year.\n\n\"Risk-free now has a cost\" and clients are learning that they should accept it, said Mauro Vittorangeli, a senior fixed-income money manager at Allianz Global Investors, which oversees about $505 billion.\n\nAnd it's not like debt investors are spoiled for choice. Benchmark 10-year securities in every G-7 nation yield less than 2 percent. Even the yield on U.S. Treasuries, \"the least ugly duck out there,\" according to Amundi's David Ric, is now at 1.77 percent after tumbling by about a half-percentage point this year.\n\nMany investors, especially at the start of the year, were looking for \"something liquid and something that has value,\" said Ric, the London-based head of absolute-return fixed-income strategies at Amundi, which oversees more than $1 trillion. \"So Treasuries looked reasonable from that perspective because they offer a decent yield.\"\n\nStill, the traditional yield advantage that U.S. debt has enjoyed over sovereign bonds in Europe and Japan isn't so clear anymore.\n\nFor euro-based buyers of 10-year Treasuries, swapping the dollar interest payments into euros over the life the security lowers the yield to 0.15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg using cross-currency yield analysis based on future expectations for interest rates and foreign exchange. That's less than the 0.2 percent yield on German 10-year bunds.\n\nFor Japanese buyers, it's even worse. The same process results in a minus 0.7 percent yield in yen.\n\nThe effect is already playing out this month. While Treasuries have returned 1 percent in February, that translates into a loss of 1.6 percent in euros, Bank of America data show. In yen, the loss balloons to 5.9 percent. What's more, hedging all the currency risk results in a return for euro buyers that's no better than just investing in German bunds.\n\nAdvantage Diminishes\n\nPart of the reason the comparative advantage has diminished has to do with the yield-starved investors in Europe and Japan themselves, who poured into U.S. debt over the past year to try and eke out bigger returns.\n\nThe worsening U.S. outlook is also driving more investors into the safety of Treasuries. Traders have all but abandoned expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. While Fed officials have said any discussion of negative rates was premature, Chair Janet Yellen noted in Congressional testimony the central bank was taking another look at them as a potential tool if the economy faltered.\n\nYet regardless of where debt investors turn for shelter, what's becoming increasingly clear that they're going to ever greater lengths for that security.\n\n\"We are in a totally new world,\" Allianz's Vittorangeli said.\n\n-- With assistance from Liz Capo McCormick and Todd White.\n\nSee also:", "(Bloomberg) -- Allianz SE, AXA SA and Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. made final bids for the rights to distribute their general insurance products through CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.'s branches across Asia, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nCIMB could fetch about $200 million from the deal, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.

With premiums growing at 13% annually - almost three times faster than the global average - the opportunity to offer insurance products to an emerging middle class is clearly attractive. However, as government bond yields in Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere fall to multi-year lows, Asian insurers find themselves confronting the same investment challenge as their U.S. and European counterparts: how to preserve and grow returns in a world of low yields.\n\nInsurers have adapted to this new environment in different ways. Many have increased allocations to overseas investments, with Taiwanese insurers preferring U.S. and European corporate bonds and Chinese insurers targeting real estate (including the famous Waldorf Astoria in midtown Manhattan). Global fixed income allocations differ across Asia ex Japan, with Taiwanese and Singaporean firms typically allocating more to the asset class than their Korean and Chinese counterparts.\n\nSeveral firms are also responding by increasing investments in alternatives, a relatively new asset class for many Asian insurers. Along with the low interest rate environment, permissive government policy and widespread adoption of private equity and hedge funds among U.S. and European insurers seem to be enticing Asian insurers to take a closer look. In January 2015, a group of Chinese insurers won regulatory approval to launch a private equity fund focused on small- and medium-sized enterprises. And since January 2014, one of the largest life insurance companies in Taiwan has invested nearly $1 billion in alternatives, net of redemptions.\n\nWhile alternatives still represent a small portion of most Asian insurance investment portfolios, outside of Asia, where yields have remained low for the last several years, insurance companies have grown increasingly comfortable with private equity and hedge fund investments. In fact, between 2008 and 2014, the book/adjusted carrying value (BACV) of private equity investments held by American insurers more than doubled. Indeed, at the end of 2014, the top 25 alternative asset managers were managing nearly $290 billion for insurance companies globally.\n\nAlternatives: Looking at risk and returns\n\nTo assess the drivers of this evolution, let's examine the result of adding alternatives to a typical insurer's investment portfolio in terms of return and volatility.\n\nIn the analysis in Figure 1, we calculate the effect of reallocating a portion of a typical insurer's equity exposure to alternatives. Because insurers tend to hold most of their assets in high-quality fixed income and equities, one might expect alternatives to enhance the return potential and diversification properties of the average portfolio. Indeed, as our analysis shows, even small allocations to hedge funds and private equity funds can lead to a meaningful improvement in the Sharpe Ratio (which measures risk-adjusted return), thanks to higher expected returns and typically low correlations with traditional asset classes.\n\nAnother factor driving higher allocations to alternative investments is the widely held belief that returns on traditional asset classes will be below their historical averages over the next several years. Figure 2 summarizes PIMCO's 10-year capital market assumptions, illustrating our expectation that returns on mainstream asset classes will be lower going forward than they have been in the past. In this scenario, insurance companies could benefit from adding alternative asset classes to improve return potential.\n\nWhile many insurance investment teams recognize the benefits of alternatives, it is often not feasible for firms to manage these strategies themselves. We therefore see a growing number of insurance companies partnering with asset managers to implement alternative strategies. Between 2009 and 2014, outsourced assets under management (AUM) from U.S. and European insurance companies grew from $1.05 trillion to $1.6 trillion, with a significant proportion of these investments going into hedge funds and private equity funds managed by third-party asset managers. We expect this trend to continue.\n\nWe see some interesting patterns in terms of the strategies that insurance companies prefer. In general, insurers tend to allocate more to private equity than to hedge funds, reflecting the higher expected returns available through longer lock-up vehicles. Within the industry, the trade-off between private equity and hedge funds is heavily influenced by the type of insurance each company underwrites (and the corresponding need for liquidity). Property and casualty insurers are more apt to invest in hedge funds than life insurers, given different liquidity needs and liability profiles. Life insurers, by contrast, tend to invest more heavily in private equity funds.\n\nOne common concern that insurance companies have with alternatives is their impact on capital ratios. Because alternatives are relatively capital intensive, insurance companies must be thoughtful and strategic in adding them to their portfolios. While these investments may require increased capital under risk-based capital (RBC), Solvency II and other risk-oriented capital frameworks, the value proposition has increasingly made this trade-off worthwhile for insurers.\n\nTo learn more about PIMCO's economic outlook, visit PIMCO.com.\n\nRobert Young is a managing director and head of the U.S. financial institutions group at PIMCO.

It also uses mobiles to deliver both immediate feedback on the customer's driving and -- if warranted -- the rewards.\n\nInsurers are increasingly under pressure to embrace new technologies, says Fran\u00e7ois Robinet, chairman of Axa Strategic Ventures, as the main components of the industry -- capital, dealing with customers and data -- are all candidates for disruption. A poll by PwC, the professional services firm, found that 69 per cent of insurance chief executives are concerned about the speed of technological change.\n\nTech initiatives under way in the industry vary. Legal & General is using retina scanning in India to speed up the process of applying for life insurance products. The retina scan immediately brings up personal data that can be used to fill in online forms. Elsewhere, insurers are using information on Facebook and social media when assessing claims. In China, Zhong An (a joint venture between Alibaba, Tencent and Ping An) sells insurance covering individual ecommerce transactions.\n\nInsurers are also using their own data better to price new policies. Aviva has discovered that its pensions customers tend to be safer drivers, so it offers them motor insurance discounts.\n\nMany initiatives are developed internally, often in company \"labs\" devoted to new products and services. But insurers are also looking externally. Some of them, including XL Catlin, Axa, Aviva, MassMutual and Allianz, have set up dedicated venture capital funds to invest in start-ups. Globally, insurers have committed more than $1bn to such funds. This month, Axa Strategic Ventures helped to lead a $55m funding round for Blockstream, which is developing blockchain, or shared ledger, technology.\n\nFor many, the real prize technology offers is the opportunity to reduce claims costs. Telematics in motor insurance is one example. If customers have incentives to drive more slowly, there should be fewer accidents. Similarly Discovery, a South African health insurer, offers incentives to customers who work out, tracking their activity via wearable devices. In the US, Beam has extended the principle to dental insurance with bluetooth-connected toothbrushes and an app that tells customers how well they are brushing.\n\nTechnological change has also created a new line of business -- cyber insurance. According to Verizon's data breach investigations report, there were almost 80,000 security incidents affecting companies' data last year. High-profile attacks on businesses such as Target in the US and TalkTalk in the UK have created concern among executives -- and an opportunity for insurers.\n\nIn the US, where companies have an obligation to report data breaches to the authorities and customers, insurers often cover the costs but they are still nervous of cyber risks. \"[They] are not quite sure of what their exposure might be to a cyber attack,\" says Andrew Coburn, of risk analysis specialist RMS.\n\nNevertheless, the market is expected to grow strongly. \"Globally, gross written premium for cyber liability is about $2.5-$3bn,\" says Glyn Thoms, of brokers Willis Towers Watson. \"But that could be $25bn by 2025.\"", "Fewer and fewer alternatives remain for risk-averse investors\n\nIt's not as if Christoph Kind relishes putting his clients' money into bonds that often pay nothing in interest and can all but guarantee losses.\n\nBut Kind is doing just that -- and he's hardly the only one.\n\nMore and more, debt investors are being confronted by a new reality where deepening concern over the global economy has made sub-zero interest rates the norm. In Germany, Kind's home market, surging haven demand has pushed average yields on about a trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) of debt below zero for the longest stretch on record. Bond prices are so high in Japan almost two-thirds of its government debt have negative yields.\n\nAnd at a time when teetering financial markets have made security a paramount concern, investors are discovering there are few good options left. Even in the U.S., long the destination of choice in times of duress, Treasuries are in such demand that when their cash flows are converted into euros, yields are even worse than the scant returns on German bunds.\n\n\"It's tough at these levels, but at the moment there seem to be few alternatives,\" said Kind, the head of asset allocation at Frankfurt Trust, which oversees about $20 billion. \"This is quite a tricky situation. The risk of a selloff in safe-haven assets has increased\" as yields get lower and lower.\n\nDespite those reservations, Kind has bought negative-yielding bonds in recent weeks. It's a response to the extraordinary steps by the likes of the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan to push interest rates below zero and buy more government bonds as they try to jump-start their economies.\n\nBut that's not all. The willingness of debt investors to effectively pay governments to borrow also reflects increasing skepticism of central bank policies -- and concern those very measures may ultimately do more harm to the global economy than good. Even after central banks around the world spent trillions since the financial crisis on quantitative easing and dropped policy rates below zero for about two dozen countries, the market's outlook for inflation globally is closing in on post-crisis lows.\n\nWhile the trade-off of losing a little money for the security of owning government debt when things seem so gloomy might be a small one for conservative investors, there are considerable risks in the mean time.\n\nLast year, fears of deflation and the ECB's introduction of QE pushed the average yield on euro-area debt to a record-low 0.475 percent and sent those on German bunds toward zero. Then, in the months that followed, faint glimmers of optimism over the outlook the region's economy helped spark a sudden and violent reversal that caused yields to soar.\n\nBy the middle of June, yields on longer-term German debt jumped more than a percentage point and left investors with an unprecedented 13 percent loss in the quarter, index data compiled by Bank of America Corp. show.\n\nNevertheless, as worries over the economic health of China and the U.S. -- the world's two main engines of growth -- continue to linger, volatility spreads throughout financial markets and investors question the wisdom of negative rates, government bonds with ultra-low yields remain in demand.\n\nThis month, yields on Germany's two-year notes touched a record-low minus 0.557 percent. The average yield on 1.06 trillion euros of German debt is currently minus 0.05 percent and has been negative every day for two weeks, according to Bank of America. In Japan, yields on about $4.5 trillion of government debt are less than zero, index data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nJust last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its 2016 global growth forecast to 3 percent from 3.3 percent in November, saying that \"financial stability risks are substantial.\"\n\nA majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey also say negative rates will be in place at the ECB until at least the first quarter of 2018 and at the BOJ until at least the end of that year.\n\n\"Risk-free now now has a cost\" and clients are learning that they should accept it, said Mauro Vittorangeli, a senior fixed-income money manager at Allianz Global Investors, which manages about $505 billion.\n\nAnd it's not like debt investors are spoiled for choice. Benchmark 10-year notes in every G-7 nation yield less than 2 percent. Even U.S. Treasuries, \"the least ugly duck out there,\" according to Amundi's David Ric, now yield 1.74 percent after tumbling by about a half-percentage point this year.\n\nMany investors, especially at the start of the year, were looking for \"something liquid and something that has value,\" said Ric, the London-based head of absolute-return fixed-income strategies at Amundi, which oversees more than $1 trillion. \"So Treasuries looked reasonable from that perspective because they offer a decent yield.\"\n\nStill, the traditional yield advantage that U.S. debt has enjoyed over sovereign bonds in Europe and Japan isn't so clear anymore.\n\nFor euro-based buyers of 10-year Treasuries, swapping the dollar interest payments into euros over the life the security lowers the yield to 0.12 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which uses a cross-currency yield analysis based on future expectations for interest rates and foreign exchange. That's less than the 0.2 percent yield on German 10-year bunds.\n\nFor Japanese buyers, it's even worse. The same process results in a minus 0.68 percent yield in yen.\n\nThe effect is already playing out this month. While Treasuries have returned 1 percent in February, that translates into a loss of 1.6 percent in euros, Bank of America data show. In yen, the loss balloons to 5.9 percent. What's more, hedging all the currency risk results in a return for euro buyers that's no better than just investing in German bunds.\n\nPart of the reason the comparative advantage has diminished has to do with the yield-starved investors in Europe and Japan themselves, who poured into U.S. debt over the past year to try and eke out bigger returns.\n\nThe worsening U.S. outlook is also driving more investors into the safety of Treasuries. Traders have all but abandoned expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. While Fed officials have said any discussion of negative rates was premature, Chair Janet Yellen noted in Congressional testimony that the central bank was taking another look at negative rates as a potential tool if the economy faltered.\n\nYet regardless of where debt investors turn for shelter, what's becoming increasingly clear that they're going to ever greater lengths for that security.\n\n\"We are in a totally new world,\" said Allianz's Vittorangeli.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "The incessant alarm goes off in its attempt to wake me from my sleep, its whiny tune blaring loudly through the speaker.\n\nLittle does it know that I have already been awake for half an hour, too excited to remain in my slumber when bigger and better things await.\n\nWith a big grin on my face I swiftly rise out of bed - mind you, this grin has been visible for a few days now, unable to be wiped off for any reason.\n\n\"It's finally here, derby day is upon us,\" I think to myself as I get ready. As a football tragic since birth, nothing can supersede this day.\n\nI put on my red and black jersey, the glorious star glowing above the emblem, and, puffing my chest out with pride, make my way down to my local sports club in the mid-afternoon to meet up with my friends. I'm ready.\n\nA group of 11 meet up, all of us friends since high school due to our passion for football. We play together - have done since Under-12s - and the belief that we are one game away from being scouted to represent Australia at the next World Cup still lingers in our hearts.\n\nDays like today are special, not just because we all love football and support our local teams, but because of how rare it is for all of us to spend the whole day together. The derby gives us an excuse to trump all other plans, silence our partners and parents, and come together to re-live memories from our school days.\n\nWhen arrive at our local sports club an immediate sense of anticipation sweeps over us. It's finally here! After all the talk leading up to this day, we are finally together.\n\nTwo of my friends are Sydney FC fans, the rest of us are Western Sydney diehards. As one of my friends said during the day, \"We are the same but different.\" We all love our clubs and the sport, but we celebrate it in our own ways.\n\nTalk flows from childish barbs and silly banter to intense discussions about the game we're about to witness. Will Mark Bridge hold the line on his own? Who will score first? Will Filip Holosko fulfill his 'marquee' tag? Will Andrew Redmayne be assured in goals? How will the Wanderers cope without Alberto? All of these questions will eventually be answered, but that won't stop any of us from believing our predictions are the only ones which will come to fruition.\n\nAfter a couple hours at the club, we embark on the journey into the city, getting off at Central and heading to a pub we frequent when we come to this part of town - our home away from home.\n\nThe vibe here is vastly different. We rub shoulders with other fans from both sides, all revelling in the excitement of the derby. Everyone is relaxed and enjoying themselves with their friends and the random event-goers around them. Childish jokes and calls are exchanged between rival fans.\n\n\"So which one of you West Sydney blokes are going to cost your team three points tonight?\" says a Sydney fan to a group of lads wearing red and black.\n\n\"If you're that desperate to catch up to us you can wear my jersey and let off a flare I have in my pocket, we know you guys could use all the help you can get,\" quips a Wanderers fan.\n\n\"I can tell you a hundred different things I'd do before wearing that jersey,\" comes the reply.\n\n\"I bet you thought of all 100 during the last Sydney game, can't really blame you for not paying attention,\" retorts the Wanderers fan. A chorus of amusement ensues from all within earshot of this rib fest.\n\nWe hear the news that we've missed the march to the stadium, which is unfortunate as it was one of the day's events we were looking forward to. We decide instead to journey to PJ Gallagher's near Allianz Stadium, as a lot of fans congregate there.\n\n\"That's it boys,\" I say to my mates \"I've had enough, I need to get inside the stadium!\"\n\nWe make the short trip to Allianz, joined by fans who have reached a similar conclusion. We turn the corner and see hordes of red and black and sky blue. This is when it hits us. It's on.\n\nWe walk in and take our seats, buzzing with anticipation. This is not our first derby, yet we are still in disbelief that Australian football has grown to such an extent that we are able to enjoy a game like this. A game that brings such a buzz to the city. A game that brings out around 40,000 people, all ready and willing to brave the rain and watch our teams square off for supremacy in the city.\n\nI love the away derby almost as much as I love the derby at Wanderland. The difference is an away derby crowd is split close to 60/40 in favour of Sydney. This adds an extra bit of spice, as both teams are supported heavily, so the noise of one supporter group does not drown out the other. Both sets of fans create the unrivaled atmosphere which has the whole city talking about this one game. There is a great mix of people in the crowd; young and old, a mix of all races, here together for 90 minutes in this cauldron.\n\nThe players emerge from the tunnel, sparking The RBB and The Cove to life. Credit to both sets of fans for providing the atmosphere which makes the A-League unique in Australian sport. Even greater credit to both sets of supporters for not setting off any flares, for not being involved in any antisocial behaviour, and, most of all, for not giving any fuel to those who look for negative stories to write about our league.\n\nI'm sure the crowd wasn't perfect - they rarely are - but as a whole the 40,000 fans were wonderful, supporting their teams in a tense and exciting game.\n\nI walk away from the game feeling disappointed that we could not get a win, but thinking that a draw was more than a fair result, considering the chances that fell for both teams. We make the arduous journey home filled with pride from the performance all the players gave us. That they all looked to have just run a marathon by full-time, disappointment clear on their faces, proves they left nothing on the field. It felt like we ran that marathon with them, and everyone, players and fans alike, was exhausted after that exhilarating encounter.\n\nAs I lie in bed, a thought flashes through my head. I remember my time as a child, growing up watching games of football all around the world. The EPL highlights show would be on every night before I had football training. The Serie A highlights show would show me how to play the game beautifully, the great AC Milan team of the day having me suspended in awe and admiration.\n\nI watched these teams frequently on SBS with the hope that one day we could get something remotely similar in Australian football in terms of noise, colour, vibrancy, quality and, most importantly, passion. Fast forward all of the years between then and now, and here we are with a product that can rival most leagues around the world for atmosphere. We have a long way to go as a league and as a sport in this country, however the inroads made in a short amount of time are something to behold.\n\nHere I was enjoying everything I had never thought I would be able to in Australia. It wasn't just one day for me, but a week of anticipation, hype and excitement leading up to the 90 minutes I witnessed. It was surreal to realise it all happened in Sydney, and that it's only going to get better.\n\nAs I reflect on Saturday's game, it dawns on me that I wasn't just watching a game. I wasn't merely an audience member. I was a part of the game. A cog in the machine that is Australian football.\n\nThere were 22 men on the pitch, 40,000 fans in the stands, and countless more watching at home. This game would have no significance if it weren't for all of these people. Because of them, this game will one day be part of the history books, and hopefully it will be a history people will look back on with fondness.\n\nWe are making history folks, and boy does it feel good!"]}, "Total": {"2016-02-19": ["The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia represents a major loss for constitutional government and the rule of law. Scalia was a legal giant who possessed a deep understanding of, and affection for, the U.S. Constitution and who discharged his duty to defend it with principled vigor and eloquence. He will go down as one of the greatest jurists in the history of American law.\n\nScalia's impact can be seen in courtrooms, law schools and the halls of Congress. He was so influential because he was a talented communicator who fully understood the proper role of the courts in our constitutional system; Scalia was faithful to Alexander Hamilton's dictum that courts are to exercise \"neither force nor will but merely judgment.\"\n\nConsider the indelible mark on American law that Scalia left:\n\nTextualism: Before Scalia arrived at the Supreme Court, the art of statutory interpretation had been lost in a sea of subjectivism. Scalia knew the proper role of the judge was to apply the law as written, not as the judge would like it to be written. He rejected the notion that courts have a roving license to rewrite statutes to conform with subjective views of legislative intent or with an unelected judge's idiosyncratic notions of justice. This judicial posture recognizes that the Congress possesses the sole authority to legislate and prevents the courts from usurping power properly belonging to the people to exercise through their elected representatives.\n\nOriginalism: Liberal Supreme Court Justice William Brennan once remarked that one could \"do anything around here with five votes.\" Brennan dismissed the idea that the Constitution possesses a stable meaning and argued that judges needed to constantly reinterpret the meaning of the Constitution's text - a Platonic king's view of the judicial power that effectively makes five unelected lawyers on the Supreme Court a perpetual constitutional convention.\n\nScalia had contempt for this view because it distorted the separation of powers and diluted self-government. Scalia instead endeavored to apply the meaning of each provision of the Constitution as it was originally understood by the society that ratified it. Like the Constitution of the Founding Fathers, Scalia's Constitution had a fixed, enduring meaning. This interpretive method necessarily limits the authority of judges and guards against unelected judges acting as an unaccountable super-legislature.\n\nThe Structural Constitution: By recognizing the important but limited role that courts play in our constitutional system, Justice Scalia was a staunch defender of the separation of powers and of the prerogative of the people to govern themselves. He often noted how one could find robust bills of rights in many totalitarian countries; what made the American system unique and our Bill of Rights effective was the basic structure of the Constitution in which legislative, executive and judicial authority are divided into separate and competing branches. Maintaining this structure is the surest way to preserve a free society, which is way Scalia was so insistent on combating the judicial usurpation of legislative power.\n\nScalia's dissent in Morrison v. Olson, a 7-1 decision upholding the independent counsel statute, brilliantly lays out the theory of the structural Constitution and his opinion has stood the test of time. He began his opinion noting: \"Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing: the potential of the asserted principle to effect important change in the equilibrium of power is not immediately evident, and must be discerned by a careful and perceptive analysis. But this wolf comes as a wolf...\" The Scalia opinion remains the definitive judicial discourse on the constitutional separation of powers.", "Next time you find yourself sucked into a debate with secularists be careful not to make these five classic mistakes, says Peter D Williams\n\nIt is not an uncommon situation. You are reading an interesting article online about some matter of recent religious controversy, but upon reaching the end of the piece you meet the comments area, and try to resist the temptation to scroll further down the page. How many times have you perused such sections before finding yourself infuriated by the base anti-Catholic bigotry you find there?\n\nStill worse, how often have you found your time irretrievably wasted, as you are sucked into futile disputation with secularist trolls who, in the famous words of Churchill, \"can't change their minds, and won't change the subject\"? Like glancing at a car-crash, however, the curiosity can be too great to resist, and you begin to read on...\n\nThis experience is hardly atypical for the average Catholic reading online, but it has even become unsurprising to experience similar situations when having a drink in the pub, or while at an otherwise genteel dinner party. Where we are called to defend and expound our Faith in these situations however, we must do so in a constructive way that raises the standard and tone of discussion.\n\nIt is regrettable, then, that experience shows us how often Catholics fail to do this effectively. As an illustrative remedy for some of the more common mistakes in this endeavour, here are five brief tips on how not to argue with atheists.\n\n1) Cynically assume the worst in people. Before speaking, or touching that keyboard, imagine your opponent to be an irredeemable ogre, whatever they may have said. Don't charitably assume they are simply misinformed, or look for the good motivations they may have in arguing as they do. At a false accusation of \"homophobia\", don't try to understand the positive impetus behind this error (genuine concern about abuse and hatred), and refrain from showing how the Church teaches compassion and care for those who experience same-sex attraction - you may help to defuse anger rather than fuel it!\n\n2) Argue as a means of venting emotion. When someone says or writes something shocking or offensive to Catholic piety, our natural reaction is to get angry. Indulge that. Try to forget any Christian goal of defending or expounding the Faith. That will only get in the way of fun. Instead, be determined to show how stupid your opponent is, and punish their ignorance and prejudice with counter-abuse. To be scrupulously gentle and reverent at all times is just far too hard. Of course it could be that, even if someone does not remember your arguments, they may remember what a model of virtue and decency you were in arguing, which might be a good witness that may help them later on - but such considerations should not get in the way of a good bout of rock throwing.\n\n3) Don't call out bad behaviour, mirror it! If someone is unnecessarily rude or vulgar, feel justified in returning like with like. That \"turn the other cheek\" stuff is far too high a standard. Simply pointing out your interlocutor's unkindness (and how it hinders discussion) would be too laborious. And sticking to the substantive arguments that have been produced? What are you,\n\na robot? Think of our Lord's response to the liars who accused Him, and the guard who hit Him, in front of the Sanhedrin. What was His answer to calumny and abuse? Well, we all know how that worked out.\n\nIt might be that following His example would accentuate the irrational meanness of the person you are engaging with (to themselves and anyone around watching your discourse) and even shame them into changing their behaviour. Don't worry about all that, though.\n\n4) Adopt the martyr complex. Few things are as convincing as arguing with someone who thinks your ideas will lead inexorably to a new totalitarian regime, or who believe themselves to be \"persecuted\". Does this come across as hysterical, and make that person look silly? Of course not. So don't forget to break out the comparisons with Hitler or Stalin, and be sure to moan about how hard done by Christians are (especially with comparison to Muslims). This is bound to win you lots of sympathy, and isn't at all clich\u00e9d. Not even a bit. No.\n\n5) For heaven's sake, don't Pray. Surely an obvious point. Praying before you interact with people, and asking God to give you the words He would have you say, and the sharp but loving mindset He would have you adopt, is just a massive spoiler. So, indeed, is praying for your opponent, that their minds and hearts might be opened, and that your conversation with them might be helpful. Prayer is lethal to good squabbling - so cut it out!\n\nIn reality, tailoring our words and our tone to the highest common denominator of human sentiment may not convince the people with whom we are immediately interacting, but may at least begin to win the hearts and minds of any bystanders who are watching. Focusing on how we can best practise the spiritual works of mercy (especially instructing the uninformed, counselling the doubtful, and bearing wrongs patiently) in our arguments with atheists will help us minister to our opponents in the most effective way. In doing so, and in witnessing to the truth of our Faith, humbly, gently and respectfully, we may truly witness to the virtue, as well as the rationality, of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.", "Change is in the air in North Korea. After years of being ranked by Skytrax as the world's worst airline, national carrier Air Koryo is undergoing a revolution, according to interviews with passengers and travel agents.\n\nNew planes, new in-flight entertainment options, smart new uniforms for the cabin attendants, even business class. It's all part of supreme leader Kim Jong Un's effort to boost tourist numbers 20-fold to two million by 2020 and supplement the nation's meagre foreign exchange.\n\nHere are five reasons to book your ticket now, before the thrill of flying the world's only one-star airline vanishes forever. (And as long as you don't mind helping fund Kim's nuclear-weapons program.)\n\n1. The Hermit Kingdom\n\nBesides the joy of experiencing Air Koryo, the main draw for most travelers is to have a peek inside the world's most isolated country. As Singaporean Mindy Tan put it after visiting last year: \"I'm sick of all the same footage of marching, pictures of Kim. I just had to witness it for myself.\"\n\nDon't worry about the odd nuclear test or missile launch. Here you can run a marathon down Pyongyang's totalitarian streets or watch 100,000 kids doing synchronized dancing. The country is trying to open up attractions like the Masikryong Ski Resort and the Lake Taesong golf club. And where else can you still get stopped from taking a selfie in the wrong place?\n\n2. The in-flight entertainment\n\nThe communal screens that drop down from the ceiling will keep you entertained with propaganda broadcasts and concerts by supreme leader Kim Jong Un's favourite all-female band, Moranbong, who sing patriotic songs about, well, Kim Jong Un. Bring noise-canceling earphones. There's no volume control.\n\n3. The planes\n\nYou don't often get tour agents who will arrange a trip to a country just to fly in its planes, but in North Korea this is possible. London-based Juche Travel Services offers an aviation-themed tour. Air Koryo recently acquired two Russian-built Tupolev Tu-204s for international routes, with an economy ticket costing about 900 yuan ($137 US) for the two-hour journey from Beijing. Once in Pyongyang, you can hop into Soviet-era aircraft such as a Mil Mi-17 transport helicopter for a buzz over the capital or a view of the mountains.\n\n4. Airport lines\n\nWhile you may suffer the inconvenience of long lines and immigration hassles at your point of departure on your way to North Korea, once you arrive in the Democratic People's Republic, it should be a breeze.\n\nNo longer do you have to shuffle through the strange temporary shed that has been masquerading as an airport terminal for the past five years. Now the capital has a sleek, new building. And with fewer than half a dozen international flights a day, and little chance of delays due to strikes, the airport bus may deliver you on time to an almost deserted building.\n\n5. The burger\n\nWhile the food, especially in the new business-class lounge, has improved, the most-photographed component of an Air Koryo trip remains the famous \"mystery-meat\" burger.\n\nTo put to rest the long-running dispute over the source of the protein, we contacted Air Koryo's office in Beijing for clarification. The airline's representatives didn't respond.", "BETHLEHEM>> Through a process of improvisation and careful character analysis, the Woodhall Players have developed a unique interpretation of George Orwell's classic fable, \"Animal Farm,\" which they will present Feb. 19-20 at 7:30 p.m. From the start, it became evident that the company could produce a cute \"kids\" version of the play or something edgier, and, as usual, the Woodhall Players chose the riskier path. Collaborating with Larry Hunt, an internationally acknowledged mask artist, the students have crafted an evening of theatre, which amuses and unnerves the viewer at the same time. The production is performed with the barest minimum of sets and costumes; as usual, it is all about the acting. Within a parable using farm animals, Orwell raises a challenging question about humans' natural proclivity toward violence and totalitarianism, and the answers can make us uncomfortable.

These laws were mostly used as instruments to thwart justified opposition, and to limit the opportunities for argument that would challenge the injustices of British oppression. Claims to reason and arguments for freedom of erstwhile colonies could be labelled as anti-national and, hence, illegal. They could be seen as threats to the hegemony of the colonial power.\n\nSedition laws left over in decolonised nation states often reflect this oppressive British legacy. In a stroke of irony, these laws carry over a colonial instrument that was deployed to silence the very voices of the many freedom fighters who are celebrated as heroes in the now- independent former British colonies. Even as Great Britain has taken a leaf from its history to repeal the Sedition Act in 2009, former British colonies such as India continue to utilise the Act as a tool for silencing diverse ideas.\n\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a key architect of the Indian freedom struggle, for instance, was charged with sedition on March 10, 1922, and sentenced to six years in prison for protesting against the British colonial rule.\n\nThe current Sedition Act in India, Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), serves as an instrument of silencing voices of difference, having been used against cartoonists, students, lecturers and other cultural practitioners.\n\nWriting about the draconian nature of Section 124A in 1951, India's first premier Jawaharlal Nehru opined: \"Now so far as I am concerned, that particular Section (Section 124A of the IPC) is highly objectionable and obnoxious and it should have no place both for practical and historical reasons, if you like, in any body of laws that we might pass. The sooner we get rid of it, the better. We might deal with that matter in other ways, in more limited ways, as every other country does but that particular thing, as it is, should have no place, because all of us have had enough experience of it in a variety of ways and apart from the logic of the situation, our urges are against it.\"\n\nThe most recent crackdown of the Indian state on student protests at the hallowed Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is telling of the increasingly chilling climate across university campuses in India. The rhetoric of anti-nationalism runs amok in branding entire bodies of students and universities as threats, feeding into a national media and public frenzy to shut down debate, conversation and difference.\n\nIn one such incident of severe state response, the president of the JNU students' union, Mr Kanhaiya Kumar, was arrested for apparently shouting anti-India slogans at a cultural evening titled, A Country Without A Post Office, on Feb 9 to discuss the self-determination of Kashmir and question the unjudicial hanging of Kashmiri separatist Mohammed Afzal Guru for his role in the attacks on the Indian Parliament in 2001.\n\nThe hanging of Afzal Guru has consistently been a point of protest because of the many uncertainties around the case. As multiple accounts emerge of what actually took place through the evening, the basis of the claim that Mr Kumar chanted anti-India slogans remains contested.\n\nResponding to the events, Home Minister Rajnath Singh warned: \"Anyone who raises anti-India slogans or tries to put a question mark on the nation's unity and integrity will not be spared.\"\n\nEducation Minister Smriti Irani said: \"The nation can never tolerate any insult to Mother India.\"\n\nSection 124A remains a powerful force for silencing democratic voices, especially so within the broader climate of totalitarianism that we are witnessing across Indian campuses. The threat to India comes from these threats to its very democratic spirit embodied in the totalitarian responses of the state.\n\nMoreover, the draconian law was used as a pretext for police entry into the campus, for police conducting organised searches of student rooms and arresting Mr Kumar. The rhetoric of anti-nationalism directed at students of the university was picked up across a number of mainstream media channels, as if as justification for the arrest. The entire university campus was vilified in the mainstream media.\n\nIn a democracy like India that takes pride in the multiplicities of discourses and ideas, the Sedition Act works as an instrument for stifling ideas and for silencing the questioning of policies. The rhetoric of anti-nationalism works to silence dissent and opposing ideas. The fervour of nationalism, once stoked, creates a climate for oppressive measures and extreme responses that draw on colonial instincts and, paradoxically, undermine a fundamental pillar of the nation state as a democracy.\n\nWhat the quick labels of anti-nationalism fail to recognise is that in the context of Indian law, the definition of sedition applies to words and actions that call for violence. In this sense, the police action on JNU campus is probably illegal under the Constitution of India. Yet, the very framework of sedition leaves open the opportunity for such wide-ranging interpretation, thus creating the pathway for totalitarian state responses.\n\nTo continue to cultivate its spirit of pluralism, India must begin by starting to undo some of the regressive elements of the Indian Penal Code. It might be worthwhile for Ms Irani to take a civics lesson on what truly is insulting to the idea of \"Mother India\" - sloganeering by a small group of students on campus or an orchestrated witch-hunt on one of India's strongest institutions of higher education. The silencing of conversations at educational institutions across India is also an attempt at silencing critical thought and debate - signs of an unhealthy democracy.\n\nStudent protests across India are speaking up against the undemocratic use of the Sedition Act as a tool for silencing. These voices offer avenues for thinking critically and seriously about the relevance of this British colonial legacy in the context of modern Asian democracies, as well as for thinking through the possibilities of creating dialogic spaces that are welcoming of difference.\n\nTo be open to difference is to make possible the articulation of diverse world views on important questions such as the sovereignty of Kashmir, plebiscite and the juridical trial of Afzal Guru. Indian democracy, through these difficult but critical conversations, has a chance to grow into new imaginations grounded in respect for differences, getting in touch with the key tenets of the spirit of India embodied in its Constitution.", "\"ABOARD THE PAPAL AIRLINER -- Inserting himself into the Republican presidential race, Pope Francis on Wednesday suggested that Donald J. Trump 'is not Christian' because of the harshness of his campaign promises to deport more immigrants and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border.\"\n\n-- Jim Yardley, New York Times\n\nThis is, of course, a colloquial and rhetorical question, in response to a question where the answer is an obvious yes. I could imagine Wm. F. Buckley, Jr., a serious if not devout Catholic, posing this question, in jest, only partly, to open a dialogue. The godfather of American conservatism, Bill would likely opine that the answer to whether Francis should intrude into an America political campaign is, sorry, an emphatic no.\n\nLike many, I admire the inspiration and passion of Pope Francis. He is truly concerned for the poor and the suffering and speaks eloquently to the dignity of each person. In reaching out to the impoverished and the forgotten, he is humble and caring and -- in the most personal and intimate way -- sets an inspired example. But in matters of economics and politics, he is, at best, uninformed.\n\nThe greatest uplifting from the deprivation and despair of poverty has come not from Church-dominated economies or from medieval feudalism, or from the serfdom of the Czars and authoritarian governments, or from socialism or communism, or from other variations of collectivism, and certainly not from interventionist economies with heavy taxation and regulation. And we certainly don't see in some of the primitive economies of Africa, or in the traditional Muslim Arab nations in the Mideast, the kind of dynamic free market economies that can help the poor. The most significant movement of large numbers of people from subsistence and extreme poverty to greater material well being and the emergence of a middle class was through the liberated free market.\n\nSouth America and Central America had a long tradition of oligarchies and what we now call crony capitalism, in which government bestowed favoritism and franchises, grants and subsidies, to the politically favored. The Pontiff's primary acquaintance with capitalism was within his native Argentina, bearing little resemblance to a classic free market. Francis routinely attributes income inequality to greed, because he does not understand how a free market can uplift the poor. Instead, he seems to ally himself with Marxists who would coerce income redistribution. He does not grasp that extreme income inequality in which people move downward from the middle class and regress toward poverty is empowered by the crony capitalism of mixed government economies which favor the wealthy who are politically connected. The counter is a limited government which operates under the full of law, the same rule of law that applies, for example, toward immigration policies.\n\nWithin his paradigm, the pontiff has now intervened in an American election. The Vatican has issued a statement of clarification about what happened yesterday. But while the statement attempts to mitigate the damage, it is not sufficiently forthright. It is almost Trump-like in its gray-area ambiguity. The damage was done. The Pope knew precisely what he was doing.\n\nOn CNN yesterday, Rev. James Martin, S.J., editor at large of America magazine, defended Francis for his criticism of Donald Trump. The pontiff was, Martin said, only expressing that the Christian view is to \"care for the stranger,\" because Christianity is \"not an us and a them.\" But Martin's true agenda emerged when he talked about \"trying to help the poor\" through an open borders policy. And if the Pope was not attacking Trump, why was Martin defending this nonexistent attack?\n\nMartin agreed with CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the Pope \"must have known\" the impact of his words. Blitzer noted that while the six-day Mexican trip was long planned, the visit to the Mexican border was added. But by whom and why? Martin could not say, before he dismissed the whole matter as the Pope simply \"going to people on the periphery.\" But if the Pope were not a pawn, as Trump said, did he orchestrate his own political gambit? Are there political operatives around the Pope who work with their counterparts In Mexico and at the border? The pope's border visit was staged, just as a politician would do.\n\nThe border visit, Martin asserted, reflected a priority of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Blitzer did not press the political implications. We already know that Big Business wants immigrants for cheap labor and to keep the wages of others down. Also, for years Catholic clerics have colluded with politicians in the Democratic Party. The Church gains new parishioners, and the Democrats, who demonize Republicans, gain bloc voters. This has happened in Southern California, where I live. Former Cardinal Roger Mahony allied himself with power brokers in the Democratic Party to support a massive influx of Hispanics, overwhelmingly Catholic, to repopulate the Catholic parishes.\n\nIt is not a non sequitur to this discussion to point out: under Mahony, priests engaged in predatory sexual attacks against young children. I am acquainted with those in law enforcement who investigated Mahony. As in the Boston archdiocese scandal popularized in the Academy Award nominated film Spotlight, the most enraged detectives and empowered prosecutors and dedicated investigative reporters were themselves Catholic. Due to the statute of limitations, the \"progressive\" Mahony narrowly escaped prosecution for repeatedly covering up these horrific crimes. Many of the victims were children from the poor Mexican families that Mahony supposedly championed.\n\nPope Francis this week did not confront the realities of a corrupt Mexican government at the highest levels, though he did address the nation's rampant violence and drug trafficking. He could have said even more about the terrorism of the drug czars, the intimidation of farmers forced to pay protection, the wave of kidnappings, and especially the exploitation of workers by crony capitalists with government franchises. Did he consider how a real free market and economic development could help the people in Mexico, so they would not leave? Did he express the need for the rule of law, in Mexico and at the border?\n\nInstead the Pope focused on a nonexistent wall, a contentious issue in an ongoing American election.\n\n\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" the Pope observed on the Papal aircraft, departing Mexico. \"This is not in the gospel.\" The Pope's defenders suggest his words be judged in context, that he was only answering a question. This is Trump-like, as when Trump will say someone merely asked a question, and he answered it (with something inflammatory). But will the Pope next lectures us on, say, Donald Trump's views on free trade and tariffs?\n\nThe Pope effectively allowed Trump to occupy the high ground. \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful,\" Trump, now seemingly a victim of the Pope's excess, read from a statement he then released. \"I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked....\"\n\nI am not a theologian, not even a Catholic. Those two disqualifications aside, I observe: (1) countries have legitimate and legally traversable borders, the integrity of which is not fair game for Francis; (2) there are reasonable arguments for and against this particular wall, about which arguments Francis appears unknowing, and not curious; (3) allegory aside, the Pope's observation thus is not metaphorical, but specific, and political: his invocation of the gospel is disheartening, implausible.\n\nDonald Trump's proposed wall should be debated on its merits in the political realm, but it is not \"not Christian.\" Note that \"walls\" are things that Francis cannot condemn \"wherever they may be.\" A wall protects Vatican City. Walls protect monasteries and convents. To keep people in? To keep people out? for other purposes? Are there bridges?\n\nThe Communists built the Berlin Wall to enslave people in totalitarianism. President Ronald Reagan, not as part of a religious revival, helped bring it down. Israel built a wall to keep terrorists out. Bibi Netanyahu, not as part of religious bigotry, champions that barrier against barbarians.\n\nAnd barbarians abound in the neighborhood of the Middle East. It is peculiar that in this day and age, when Christians, especially there, suffer discrimination and persecution, assault and rape, torture and murder, as part of an ethnic -- shall we more accurately say, religious -- cleansing, that the world is apathetic. For example, the United Nations refugee camps discriminate against Christians, in favor of Muslims, though many Arab countries will not even accept their fellow Muslims. And yet the U.S. under President Obama has accepted refugees in this ratio, 97 percent Muslim, 3 percent Christian.\n\nPresident Obama and others casually compare Muslim refugees to Jews fleeing the Holocaust. Jews were being killed solely because they were Jews. They had nowhere to go. They were not violent and had no agenda to convert others, and certainly not by force. They wanted to flee and assimilate elsewhere. In many cases they had relatives or private organizations that wanted to help them.\n\nThe Muslim refugees in recent years and months are quite different than Muslims who came to the United States years ago. Many of them from decades ago did not want to impose their religion on others and assimilated. In recent years and the current wave include Muslims who are not persecuted because of their religion. They often are in internecine warfare, even between competing Muslims. They have many Arab nations that could be a source of refuge. Coming to the West, many do not want to assimilate but to transform the host nation in their image. And we have government welfare programs for them.\n\nA humanitarian program would help these folks resettle in the Middle East, not in Europe or the United States. An American President would show leadership, as would the Pope. Call upon Arab nations to help their brothers in need. Look toward resettlement back in their native lands when peace is restored.\n\nWhere is the Pope on this? Should the West accept masses of Muslims, a significant portion of whom believe in forced conversion of Christians?\n\nIt's wise that we should not inflame or exacerbate religious wars, or play to the Islamist caricature of \"crusaders.\" But ISIS and other extremists in the name of Islam are brutalizing girls and women and beheading Christians, as Trump points out regularly, and what he says resonates. Is it moral for us to obsess, instead, about the need to accommodate the West to Muslims, many of whom repudiate Western values and the Judeo-Christian ethos? This same Pope has made only limited calls for Arab nations to help their Muslim brethren. Does the Pope think he's going to convert Muslims to Catholicism?\n\nIn short, is it \"Christian\" to turn the other cheek and not confront Islamo-Fascists?\n\nNo wonder Trump scored points, turning the table against the Pope. \"When the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy,\" the extemporaneous Trump said, reading directly from a rare written statement, \"I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now...\"\n\nYet, amidst all this, Francis, like brother Obama, seems more concerned with, for example, the unsettled but alleged certainty of presumed catastrophic global warming. (Yesterday, CNN commentator Father Charles Beck observed that Donald Trump was alienating liberal Catholics because he did not recognize \"climate change.\") Outside of almost every aspect of long-held Church doctrine (abortion perhaps the most prominent example) in which Francis and President Obama disagree, the transformational Pope and transformational president seem to be in the same political caucus.\n\nLike progressive Christians, like reform Jews, like fallen away Catholics, and like secular humanists, the two egalitarians -- the pontiff and the president -- believe that government must violate the commandment of \"thou shall not steal\" to redistribute income. Neither man understands how to nurture economic growth to ameliorate poverty. Francis fails to grasp that nation-states have borders that are part of that dreaded secular world. And President Obama, we already know, believes American exceptionalism is a heresy.\n\nIn that universalism, the Pope's trip to the line separating the United States and Mexico for a cross-border Mass was not an exercise in spirituality. It was a political act. The United States is a generous nation open to immigrants, but when it comes to what the laws and procedures should be, and how they should be addressed politically, the Pope is a foreigner interfering in our sovereignty and in our election. Yet the Pope, returning from Mexico, was like a candidate on a campaign plane holding a media availability. One hope he will have the wisdom to reflect and move beyond the fray, and not return to it. The Vatican's clarification statement today was a beginning, but not much of one.\n\nThe Pope is a man of prodigious intelligence. So he was disingenuous when he said, \"...about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that.\" Francis knew he had attacked a candidate in an election in the United States. Worse, Francis added: \"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that.\"\n\nDonald Trump is not humble. But the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Catholics has now assumed a Trump-like stance. Instead of walking back his presumption, Francis defended himself with a sound bite: \"Thank God he said I was a politician because Aristotle defined the human person as 'animal politicus.' So at least I am a human person.\" This is not a game of soundbites.\n\nClearly the pontiff is not a political strategist. He has taken one of Trump's main issues -- open borders and illegal immigration -- and drawn more attention to it. And in doing so, the Pope has opened a dialogue on Trump's terms, because he has offended not Trump,but many of his supporters or would-be supporters who happen to be people of faith, and Catholics.\n\nHis outburst is a gift to Trump that will keep giving. The pope's words will help Trump, not because, as implied by some mainstream media, South Carolina evangelical voters are anti-Catholic bigots. However, many Protestant voters there will not take kindly to the Pope passing judgment on whether someone is or is not a good Christian. This is not the language of unity.\n\nMany Catholics do not follow the Church on doctrinal matters involving such issues as abortion and marriage and divorce; does the Pope expect them to follow him on politics? Catholics are about one-fifth of the American electorate and some Catholics will now opt for Trump to show their independence. You will now see some prominent Catholics endorse Trump. As for Catholics, consider that many -- including the \"ethnics\" the American Catholics descended from Polish and Eastern European families -- feel an affinity for Trump. These are the people who -- or their relatives who -- were once employed as steelworkers or in the auto industry or in the factories of the Rust Belt. Now they are unemployed or underemployed, or in low paying jobs. Perhaps the Pope doesn't understand Buffalo or Pittsburgh, Cleveland or Detroit. These people see themselves as victims of globalization and trade wars, and bad trade deals and, fairly or not, victims of illegal immigration.\n\nI could also discuss many Catholics of Irish and Italian descent who feel disenfranchised. These are hard-working people who have faith in their Catholic Church. Many kept their faith and remained loyal to the Catholic Church despite scandals of financial irregularities and sexual abuse. These people are not racially or religiously prejudiced. They are not bigoted against immigrants or Mexicans or Muslims. These Catholics are good people. But they are not looking to the Pope for political endorsements and recommendations. And they probably do not seek his guidance on matters like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nMeanwhile, the overall electorate (including Trump's targeted Republican voters) sees another Establishment figure, no less than the Pope, in hyperbolic mode against the politically incorrect Trump. Independent voters see another reason to coalesce around Trump.\n\n\"As to whether I am a pawn [of the Mexican government], well, maybe, I don't know,\" Francis continued in response to Trump \"I'll leave that up to your judgment and that of the people.\" Here is the Pope as polemicist a few days before the South Carolina primary. This is not a dialogue that benefits Francis, only Donald. The Pope did become a prop among those who believe not in immigration in way consonant with the rule of law, but who believe in the anarchy of porous borders. The \"them vs. us\" that the Pontiff laments -- that is borne out of failed government economic policies on both sides of the border that inhibit economic growth and job creation.\n\nTrump was wrong to question the faith of Seventh Day Adventist Ben Carson and Southern Baptist Ted Cruz. But that's Trump. Carson has made his religious faith an integral part of who he is. And even the detractors of Cruz acknowledge his faith; indeed, his liberal critics feel he is too religious for their taste. Trump was out of line. But he is, whether he admits it or not, a politician.\n\nThe Holy Father is held, shall we say, to a higher standard.\n\nWhen you have mainstream media and even Trump's opponents leaning toward Trump in this controversy, it's clear the Pope got it wrong. Trump's reaction and statement were uncharacteristically moderate and quite calibrated. The Pope had the effect of moderating Trump.\n\nMario Rubio is a Catholic from birth, but he pointed out the border is not just about immigrants but also about terrorism. Rubio said, \"We are a sovereign country and we control who comes in, just like Vatican City controls who comes into the Vatican.\" Jeb Bush is a convert to Catholicism. In this controversy, Jeb has taken the high road, which is the right thing for him (and anyone else) to do. \"Christianity is between him and his creator,\" Jeb said about Trump. Showing class, Jeb continued, \"I don't question anybody's Christianity.\"", "After decades under a brutal military dictatorship, Myanmar is steadily, if unevenly, moving towards legitimate democracy. Reasonably fair elections have been held, military interference is lessening and the economy is opening up. Yet, American economic sanctions remain in place.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration moves headlong into easing the diplomatic and economic isolation of Cuba - where the current totalitarian regime has made no commitments to democracy or human rights, supports a disastrous regime in Venezuela and shows no interest in economic liberalization. In fact, Cuba is getting more repressive.\n\nBut this is no surprise. For a long time, but accelerating under President Obama, American sanctions policy has been an illogical, incoherent, ineffective mess. The United States currently imposes sanctions on over a dozen foreign countries that have produced material changes in those nations' behavior that range from nothing to getting worse.\n\nAmerican sanctions policy is normally driven by a media feeding frenzy with either the president of members of Congress jump on the publicity bandwagon. Once in place, sanctions tend to attain a powerful inertia - there is little to gain by letting other nations off the hook, particularly when changes in policy or government are unlikely to be ideal in the eyes of the American media and political class. Of course, nations where American has vital national interests get off with a tongue-lashing, if that.\n\nThe imposition of economic sanctions is nothing less than a declaration of intellectual bankruptcy and political cowardice. Imposing sanctions offers cheap and easy publicity with no real cost.\n\nSanctions are mostly tokenism. Either America's political leadership is unwilling to engage in a serious strategy to effect change or is unwilling to admit that the United States does not have the requisite influence necessary to force change.\n\nThe useless sanctions regime against Russia is a perfect example. Since sanctions were imposed by the Obama administration, Putin and Russia have formally annexed the Crimea, continued to occupy eastern Ukraine with a proxy army, increased aid and involvement in Syria, and clamped down ever more on domestic dissent. In short, Russia is getting worse.\n\nA cursory knowledge of Russian history would have predicted failure. Russia is a nation predisposed to xenophobia, prefers strong central leadership over democracy and has stoically accepted extraordinary economic difficulties. To think that knocking a couple of percentage points off of Russian GNP would be effective is absurd.\n\nInstead of sanctions, the Obama administration could have helped the Ukraine truly defend itself. That does not mean aircraft carriers and ballistic missiles, rather defensive systems and assault weapons that would assist in the defeat of ground troops. Handing Putin's irregulars and special forces a defeat would do far more to change behavior than banning his generals from visiting EPCOT.\n\nAnd Russia is not unique. In the vast majority of cases, economic sanctions are nothing more than empty symbolism and political grandstanding. In only the rarest of outliers do sanctions effect real change. Far more often changes in foreign governments' policies are the result of far larger internal and external socio-economic forces. The alleged pressure imposed by sanctions is more than outweighed by nationalistic anger at foreign interference.\n\nIt is time to finally drop the charade that sanctions are anything but a minor diplomatic tool, to be used selectively for specific, accomplishable goals. Unfortunately, as long as public relations trumps smart foreign policy, the United States will continue to waste resources and squander its influence.", "Being a little kid in the early 1960s was an ulcer-inducing experience. Aside from traditional anxieties like parents, teachers and girls (cooties were not officially stamped out until sometime around 1972), we had to worry about whether envious and possibly cannibalistically inclined neighbors would break into our fallout shelters when the sirens finally went off (or, if our dads were heedless slackers, whether we'd be able to break into the shelters of others). Or the epidemic of prison escapes by homicidal maniacs with hooks for hands.\n\nAnd worst of all, the robots, insensate killing machines with gruesome mechanical claws and death-ray-firing cathode tubes for faces. When I was in the fourth grade, the comic book Magnus, Robot Fighter, in which a manic human karate warrior battled a government of totalitarian robots, was stealthily passed around like a samizdat resistance manual.\n\nSo imagine my disbelief while watching a new episode of PBS' Nova documentary series declare that \"for generations science fiction has portrayed robots as our loyal servants.\" All I can say, buddy, is you haven't been watching the same movies I have.\n\nThe Nova episode Rise of the Robots is half of double shot of PBS don't-fear-the-tech documentaries, along with The Human Face of Big Data. Both are crisply written updates on the tech revolution that, while somewhat airy on the dark underbellies of their subjects (and I don't mean just the complete dismissal of the possibility that a Martian robot could kidnap Santa Claus).\n\nIf Rise of the Robots is to be believed, then I underwent all that fourth-grade psychological scarring for nothing. Even 50 years later, robots are a pack of cloddish spastics who haven't even mastered the arts of climbing a ladder or stepping over a stray cinder block, much less the enslavement of the human race.\n\nWhile robot devices in carefully controlled factory environments are already building cars, packing boxes and sorting jelly donuts -- the Japanese have even fulfilled the ancient human dream of a robot who can free us of the dread task of making pancakes -- they haven't even begun to cope with the wild and wooly exigencies of the world outside.\n\n\"You don't realize how hard something like walking is until you try to reproduce it in a machine,\" says an abashed engineer in Rise of the Robots. One of the featured robots in the show required two million lines of written code, even though it can't really do much more than walk around fall down, the latter activity so frequent that it's kept on a safety tether to avoid broken arms and legs.\n\nMuch of Rise of the Robots revolves around a million-dollar contest among engineers to see whose robot can most quickly negotiate an obstacle course including eight simple tasks. The robots being the hopeless blockheads they are, contest rules permit them to be directed by human operators rather than artificial intelligence. And the imbecile lack of discernment of on the part of robots can scarcely be overstated. \"We let the human tell the difference between a cat and dog, a valve and a door,\" one researcher explains apologetically.\n\nThe supposed point of the contest is the development of disaster-rescue robots who could drag people out of burning buildings or control a meltdown at a nuclear power plant by flipping switches and closing valves -- tasks that proved insurmountably more difficult than flipping pancakes for the Japanese robots who were fruitlessly dispatched to the 2011 Fukushima.\n\nBut Rise of the Robots takes little notice of the identity of the contest's sponsor, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which over the years has spent a lot more time and money on developing Predator drones and Arclight missiles than on rescuing kittens from trees. It may well be true at, for the moment, the only targets really threatened by robots are the jobs of $15-an-hour \"living wage\" burger-flippers at fast-food restaurants -- a Big Mac is not significantly more challenging than a pancake -- but count on DARPA to extend their range as quickly as possible.\n\nArtificial intelligence, the flip side of data collection (data isn't much good unless you have a way to sort through it) also has grand cinematic tradition of malicious dysfunction, from the homicidally self-aware HAL of 2001 to the priapic Proteus, who rapes and impregnates Julie Christie in Demon Seed.\n\nYet rogue AI or pretty much any other downside is absent from The Human Face of Big Data, aside from a brief and de rigueur invocation of the National Security Agency (NSA). Instead, the documentary spends a big chunk of its time making wowie-zowie noises about the amount of data being scooped up these days.\n\n\"In the near future,\" observes the narrator in Big Data, \"every object on earth will be generating data, including our homes, our cars, even our bodies. Almost everything we do today leaves a trail of digital exhaust.\"\n\nBy the year 2020, we'll already have on hand 40 zettabytes of collected data. Which, if you're wondering, is the same number you get if you count up every single grain of sand on the planet and then multiply by 75 ... the most significant implication of which, I should think, is that somebody is actively conducting a census of Earth's grain of sand, which rather goes to prove Big Data's point.\n\nMost of the rest of the show is an admittedly impressive of ways in which data collection can immeasurably improve human life. It turns out that real-time tracking of Google searches about the flu is a better predictor of outbreaks of the disease than the CDC, where doctors' reports take a couple of weeks to accumulate. And minute fluctuations in the heartbeats of newborns detected by maternity-ward monitors signal the presence of infections long before traditional warning signals like high temperatures or vomiting appear.\n\nTo collect this, of course, requires a Big-Brotherish amount of monitoring. Big Data describes an MIT study aimed at sussing out the details of how children acquire language. One of the researchers wired every room of his home to record every moment of the first two years of his first-born son's life, transcribing 8 million words of speech in the process. The study's two revelations were that words are learned less through sheer bulk of repetition than by repetition in different contexts -- that is, \"water\" spoken aloud in the presence of a kitchen sink, a toilet and a garden hose will be picked up more quickly by a baby than hearing it 20 times off a flash card -- and also that \"water,\" spoken aloud by a toddler who has just learned it, starts to sound like \"kill me now\" around its 500th repetition.\n\nYet Big Data seems not to have contemplated how this degree of observation may affect the observed. \"There's a company right now in Boston that can actually predict that you're going to get depressed two days before you get depressed,\" marvels one researcher. Perhaps we need a study of how many times the phrase \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" must be repeated to an Ivy League academic before they grasp its meaning.\n\nEven more chilling was an unassuming interview with an executive at a Silicon Valley data-collection company in which he mused: \"How do you get another two billion people on the planet? You can't do it unless you start instrumenting every little thing and dialing it just right.\" If that doesn't suggest to you the totalitarian impulse of the social engineer's soul, you need to be rewired, quick.", "Change is in the air in North Korea. After years of being ranked by Skytrax as the world's worst airline, national carrier Air Koryo is undergoing a revolution, according to interviews with passengers and travel agents.\n\nNew planes, new in-flight entertainment options, smart new uniforms for the cabin attendants, even business class. It's all part of supreme leader Kim Jong Un's effort to boost tourist numbers 20-fold to 2 million by 2020 and supplement the nation's meager foreign exchange.\n\nHere are five reasons to book your ticket now, before the thrill of flying the world's only one-star airline vanishes forever. (And as long as you don't mind helping fund Kim's nuclear-weapons program.)\n\n1. The Hermit Kingdom\n\nBesides the joy of experiencing Air Koryo, the main draw for most travelers is to have a peek inside the world's most isolated country. As Singaporean Mindy Tan put it after visiting last year: \"I'm sick of all the same footage of marching, pictures of Kim. I just had to witness it for myself.\"\n\nDon't worry about the odd nuclear test or missile launch. Here you can run a marathon down Pyongyang's totalitarian streets or watch 100,000 kids doing synchronized dancing. The country is trying to open up attractions like the Masikryong Ski Resort and the Lake Taesong golf club. And where else can you still get stopped from taking a selfie in the wrong place?\n\n2. The in-flight entertainment\n\nThe communal screens that drop down from the ceiling will keep you entertained with propaganda broadcasts and concerts by supreme leader Kim Jong Un's favorite all-female band, Moranbong, who sing patriotic songs about, well, Kim Jong Un. Bring noise-canceling earphones. There's no volume control.\n\n3. The planes\n\nYou don't often get tour agents who will arrange a trip to a country just to fly in its planes, but in North Korea this is possible. London-based Juche Travel Services offers an aviation- themed tour. Air Koryo recently acquired two Russian-built Tupolev Tu-204s for international routes, with an economy ticket costing about 900 yuan ($137) for the two-hour journey from Beijing. Once in Pyongyang, you can hop into Soviet-era aircraft such as a Mil Mi-17 transport helicopter for a buzz over the capital, or a view of the mountains.\n\n\"It's a very different experience, traveling back 20, 30 years,\" says Sam Chui, an aviation enthusiast who's flown Air Koryo about 20 times.\n\n4. Airport lines\n\nWhile you may suffer the inconvenience of long lines and immigration hassles at your point of departure on your way to North Korea, once you arrive in the Democratic People's Republic, it should be a breeze.\n\nNo longer do you have to shuffle through the strange temporary shed that has been masquerading as an airport terminal for the past five years, now the capital has a sleek, brand-new building. And with fewer than half a dozen international flights a day, and little chance of delays due to strikes, the airport bus may deliver you on time to an almost deserted building.\n\n5. The burger\n\nWhile the food, especially in the new business-class lounge, has improved, the most-photographed component of an Air Koryo trip remains the famous \"mystery-meat\" burger.\n\n\"The burger has been going on for so many years, everyone's making fun of it,\" says Chui, who has eaten at least 10 of them. To put to rest the long-running dispute over the source of the protein, we contacted Air Koryo's office in Beijing for clarification. The airline's representatives didn't respond.", "IN 1984, the U.S. Senate responded to the persecution of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov by renaming the site of the Soviet Embassy on 16th Street NW Andrei Sakharov Plaza. It was a symbolic act, but one that sent a persistent message to Soviet diplomats, who were unavoidably reminded of Sakharov every time they received a piece of mail. The dissident's stepdaughter told us in 2014 that the renaming \"definitely made a difference .\u2009.\u2009. it raised the level of awareness.\" Two years after the change, Sakharov was released from internal exile.\n\nNow the Senate has taken a comparable and equally worthy step by voting overwhelmingly to rename the location of the Chinese Embassy, on International Place NW, 1 Liu Xiaobo Plaza, in honor of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident. Mr. Liu, who authored a 2008 petition calling for an end to China's totalitarian system, has been imprisoned by the regime since 2009; he was sentenced to 11 years on charges of inciting state subversion. His wife, Liu Xia, has been under house arrest since 2010, even though she has not been charged with or convicted of any offense.\n\nThis is a particularly good time to impress upon China's diplomats and their masters that Mr. Liu and other defenders of human rights will not be forgotten. President Xi Jinping is in the midst of a sweeping crackdown against critics and independent voices of all kinds, in and outside of China. Lawyers who for years have worked to expand rights have been jailed on trumped-up charges; five editors at a Hong Kong publishing house that was to publish a critical book on Mr. Xi were abducted, in at least two cases outside of mainland China, and detained. Western governments, many of which have shied away from criticizing these offenses, need to make clear that they will not be silenced on Beijing's violations of human rights.\n\nThat's why it is particularly disturbing that the State Department has indicated that President Obama will veto the Senate measure if it reaches his desk. Mr. Obama already has a poor record of speaking out for Mr. Liu and other Chinese dissidents, despite his occasional promises to do so. Now he apparently thinks it more important to avoid offending Mr. Xi than to stand up for a man who will be remembered as the Sakharov of China, a peaceful advocate for democratic reform.\n\nOf course, the regime is bristling. \"If the relevant bill is passed into law, it will cause serious consequences,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a news conference. He went on to \"demand the U.S. Senate stop promoting the bill.\" Those words ought only to fortify Congress's resolve. It's sickening to think that Mr. Obama would respond to such crude threats by exercising a veto -- or that legislators would back down. The House should quickly approve the legislation; and if Liu Xiaobo Plaza must be created as an override of Mr. Obama's veto, it will be a sad but accurate reflection of his record on human rights.\n\nRead more about this topic:\n\nThe Post's View: Renaming a street after Liu Xiaobo is the right thing to do\n\nFred Hiatt: At the state dinner, leave some seats empty for China's political prisoners\n\nYang Jianli: Aung San Suu Kyi should stand up for Liu Xiaobo", "Apple faces a hearing in the government's demand that it help the FBI break into a terrorist's iPhone. The company says bigger issues are at stake. What do you say? Please vote.\n\nA federal magistrate has ordered Apple to help the FBI hack into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino massacre terrorists. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined in a strongly worded letter, saying this would mark \"an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers.\"\n\nHis specific concern is that the government is asking for the creation of a \"backdoor\" that could be used against anyone, even without a warrant.\n\nThe battle has a bit of he said/she said, at least as far as the Associated Press tries to thread the needle. But tech security specialist Bruce Schneier, writing in the Washington Post, lays out a careful explainer while ultimately siding with Apple.\n\n\"What the FBI wants to do would make us less secure, even though it's in the name of keeping us safe from harm,\" he writes. \"Powerful governments, democratic and totalitarian alike, want access to user data for both law enforcement and social control. We cannot build a backdoor that only works for a particular type of government, or only in the presence of a particular court order.\"\n\nThat doesn't keep many Americans from seeing terrorism as the No. 1 concern. Since 2001, they have supported extraordinary expansion of government power via the Patriot Act and other laws.\n\nSo pull out your (cough-cough) secure device and make a binary choice:", "President Francois Hollande, whose legitimacy stems from nothing but a fraudulent multiparty electoral system, has repeatedly abused his authority since taking office in 2012 by waging illegal wars in foreign countries (i.e., Mali, Syria) without consulting his electors. [1]\n\nHe recently failed to confer with them when his Socialist government responded to last year's terrorist attacks in Paris by adopting Orwellian domestic policies - policies that have allowed the Hollande administration to spy on citizens, block websites containing \"terrorist related content\", strip convicted \"terrorists\" of French citizenship, and criminalize activism against Israeli occupation.[2]\n\nThese policies prevent the spread of information which may expose the government's criminal activities. We should note, here, that the state of emergency greatly facilitates political corruption. [3]\n\nTo put it briefly, the state of emergency law turns France into a totalitarian police state which can act for a maximum period of 12 days without requiring judicial oversight or search warrants. Given France's compliance with Zionist interests, it is not surprising that Human Rights Watch recently exposed the French government's \"abusive and discriminatory raids and house arrests against Muslims under its sweeping new state of emergency law.\" This discrimination is not coming to end any time soon, for Hollande's administration just voted in favor of extending its state of emergency for three months.\n\nSince the government can use its extraordinary powers to force journalists (via fear tactics like law suits and heavy fines) to comply with policies which emphasize security over freedom (i.e., censorship, spying), the state of emergency ironically prevents any independent investigation into the criminal activities that triggered the emergency in the first place.\n\nThe United States faced a similar scenario after the 9-11 attacks, during which the federal government not only failed to consult the American people on the Patriot Act, but also never formally investigated what happened on 9-11. Instead, a confluence of American-Israeli intelligence networks prevented the discovery of the facts by tightly controlling \"investigation and access to evidence, media interpretation of the event, and related litigation.\" [4]\n\nMore than a decade later, something similar is taking place in France because, as Thierry Meyssan points out, the state of emergency is part of a global campaign to prevent conspiracies from surfacing on the internet:\n\n\"In 2008... the US government had decided to fund individuals, both at home and abroad, to disrupt the forum websites of conspiracy theorists and to create groups to contradict them.\n\nThis not having sufficed, France is called upon to take authoritarian measures. As in the past, the French elites, of which the Socialist Party forms the pseudo-left wing, have placed themselves under the orders of the main military power of the time, in this case, the US.\"\n\nSam Scheichner's recent blog post for the Wall Street Journal confirms France's intention to cooperate with America to clamp down on \"terrorist content\" on the internet:\n\n\"During his forthcoming visit [to the Silicon Valley in February 2016], Mr. Cazeneuve says he will meet with U.S. firms to 'update our level of cooperation,' and also get together with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to discuss their recent push to curb terrorist content on social media.\n\n'The U.S. now also wants to work with operators to counteract terrorist content on the Internet,' Mr. Cazeneuve said. 'Our audacity has paid off, and now we're schooling others, and I'm very happy about that.'\"\n\nCazeneuve's optimism conveniently hides the fact that the U.S has used the NSA to spy on France's last three presidents; that terrorism itself is an American-Israeli enterprise; that \"terrorist content\" can mean anything and therefore \"to counteract terrorist content\" might in the future imply a clampdown both on public information (i.e., conspiracy theories) and on encryption communications - a clampdown on internet privacy as a whole, of which the state of emergency can facilitate.\n\nSo France is doing everything in (and now outside of) its powers today to prevent the spread of information which may expose its criminal activities alongside America and its Zionist allies.\n\nMore people realize that the internet is the only place where they can freely debate such issues because it is the only tool capable of horizontalizing the distribution of subversive information and creating a platform for community-building which cuts across class antagonisms during a banking crisis.\n\nSince the people's access to public information on the internet is itself their best tool for independent thinking, their best defense against misjudgment and misinformation because they gain a more objective understanding of things (insofar as they are less liable to the influences of the government), Hollande's administration is now pressed to respond to this threat by extending the French state of emergency.\n\nNotes:\n\nFrancois Hollande is continuing his Republican predecessor's (Nicolas Sarkozy's) Zionist crusade against Libya all the while extending the conflict to other regions like Syria. In this regard, the left and right wings of the political spectrum are identical. The Latin American Herald Tribune reported on January 26 that \"last year 283 websites were blocked to remove their content, considered illegal, thanks to the anti-terrorist legislation.\" At this pace, we should probably expect a transition from extrajudicial censorship to automatic censorship by 2017.\n\nIt amazes me how quickly France went from being against the War on Terror to one of its main exponents. France was opposed to the invasion of Iraq under the Chiraq government. But after Sarkozy's election in 2007, it engaged itself in the Zionist War on Terror . Thierry Meyssan adds that France became a terrorist state in 2011, when it invaded Libya.\n\nBollyn, Christopher. Solving 9-11: The Deception that Changed the World. 2012. p. 25\n\nComment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page\n\nBecome a Member of Global Research", "American society is morally bankrupt and politically broken, and its vision of the future appears utterly dystopian. As the United States descends into the dark abyss of an updated form of totalitarianism, the unimaginable has become imaginable in that it has become possible not only to foresee the death of the essential principles of constitutional democracy, but also the birth of what Hannah Arendt once called the horror of dark times. The politics of terror, a culture of fear, and the spectacle of violence dominate America's cultural apparatuses and legitimate the ongoing militarization of public life and American society.\n\nUnchecked corporate power and a massive commodification, infantilization, and depoliticization of the polity have become the totalitarian benchmarks defining American society. In part, this is due to the emergence of a brutal modern-day capitalism, or what some might call neoliberalism. This form of neoliberal capitalism is a particularly savage, cruel, and exploitative regime of oppression in which not only are the social contract, civil liberties and the commons under siege, but also the very notion of the political, if not the planet itself. The dystopian moment facing the United States, if not most of the globe, can be summed up in Fred Jameson's contention \"that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.\" He goes on to say that \"We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world.\"1\n\nOne way of understanding Jameson's comment is through the ideological and affective spaces in which the neoliberal subject is produced and market-driven ideologies are normalized. Capitalism has made a virtue out of self-interest and the pursuit of material wealth and in doing so has created a culture of shattered dreams and a landscape filled with \"Broken highways, bankrupt cities, collapsing bridges, failed schools, the unemployed, the underpaid and the uninsured: all suggest a collective failure of will. These shortcomings are so endemic that we no longer know how to talk about what is wrong, much less set about repairing it.\"[i]\n\nYet, there is a growing recognition that casino capitalism is driven by a kind of mad violence and form of self-sabotage and that if it does not come to an end what we will experience in all probability is the destruction of human life and the planet itself. Certainly, more recent scientific reports on the threat of ecological disaster from researchers at the University of Washington, NASA, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reinforce this dystopian possibility.2 The undermining of public trust and public values has now given way to a market-driven discourse that produces a society that has lost any sense of democratic vision and social purpose and in doing so resorts to state terrorism, the criminalization of social problems, and culture of cruelty. Institutions that were once defined to protect and enhance human life now function largely to punish and maim.\n\nAs Michael Yates points out throughout this book, capitalism is devoid of any sense of social responsibility and is driven by an unchecked desire to accumulate capital at all costs. As power becomes global and politics remains local, ruling elites no longer make political concessions to workers or any other group that they either exploit or consider disposable.\n\nSecurity and crisis have become the new passwords for imposing a culture of fear and for imposing what Giorgio Agamben has called a permanent state of exception and a technology of government repression.[ii] A constant appeal to a state of crisis becomes the new normal for arming the police, curtailing civil liberties, expanding the punishing state, criminalizing everyday behavior, and supressing dissent. Fear now drives the major narratives that define the United States and give rise to dominant forms of power free from any sense of moral and political conviction, if not accountability.\n\nIn the midst of this dystopian nightmare, there is the deepening abyss of inequality, one that not only separates the rich from the poor, but also increasingly relegates the middle and working classes to the ranks of the precariat. Concentrations of wealth and income generate power for the financial elite and unchecked misery for most people, a fear/insecurity industry, and a growing number of social pathologies.\n\nMichael Yates in The Great Inequality provides a road map for both understanding the registers that produce inequality as well as the magnitude of the problems it poses across a range of commanding spheres extending from health care and the political realm to the environment and education. At the same time, he exposes the myths that buttress the ideology of inequality. These include an unchecked belief in boundless economic growth, the notion that inequality is chosen freely by individuals in the market place, and the assumption that consumption is the road to happiness. Unlike a range of recent books on inequality, Yates goes beyond exposing the mechanisms that drive inequality and the panoply of commanding institutions that support it. He also provides a number of strategies that challenge the deep concentrations of wealth and power while delivering a number of formative proposals that are crucial for nurturing a radical imagination and the social movements necessary to struggle for a society that no longer equates capitalism with democracy.\n\nAs Yates makes clear throughout this book, money now engulfs everything in this new age of disposability. Moreover, when coupled with a weakening of movements to counter the generated power of capitalists, the result has been a startling increase in the influence of predatory capitalism, along with inequities in wealth, income, power, and opportunity. Such power breeds more than anti-democratic tendencies, it also imposes constraints, rules, and prohibitions on the 99 percent whose choices are increasingly limited to merely trying to survive. Capitalists are no longer willing to compromise and have expanded their use of power to dominate economic, political, and social life. For Yates, it is all the more crucial to understand how power works under the reign of global capitalism in order to grasp the magnitude of inequality, the myriad of factors that produce it, and what might be done to change it.\n\nAccompanying the rise of a savage form of capitalism and the ever-expanding security state is the emergence of new technologies and spaces of control. One consequence is that labor power is increasing produced by machines and robotic technologies which serve to create \"a large pool of more or less unemployed people.\" Moreover, as new technologies produce massive pools of unused labor, it also is being used as a repressive tool for collecting \"unlimited biometric and genetic information of all of its citizens.\"[iii]\n\nThe ongoing attack on the working class is matched by new measures of repression and surveillance. This new weaponized face of capitalism is particularly ominous given the rise of the punishing state and the transformation of the United States from a democracy in progress to a fully developed authoritarian society. Every act of protest is now tainted, labeled by the government and mainstream media as either treasonous or viewed as a potential act of terrorism. For example, animal rights activists are put on the terrorist list. Whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden are painted as traitors. Members of the Black Lives Matter movement are put under surveillance,[iv] all electronic communication is now subject to government spying, and academics who criticize government policy are denied tenure or worse.\n\nUnder neoliberalism, public space is increasingly converted into private space undermining those sphere necessary for developing a viable sense of social responsibility, while also serving to transform citizenship into mostly an act of consumption. Under such circumstances, the notion of crisis is used both to legitimate a system of economic terrorism as well as to accentuate an increasing process of depoliticization. Within this fog of market induced paralysis, language is subject to the laws of capitalism, reduced to a commodity, and subject to the \"tyranny of the moment....emaciated, impoverished, vulgarized and squeezed out of the meanings it was resumed to carry.\"[v]\n\nAs the latest stage of predatory capitalism, neoliberalism is part of a broader economic and political project of restoring class power and consolidating the rapid concentration of capital, particularly financial capital.[vi] As a political project it includes \"the deregulation of finance, privatization of public services, elimination and curtailment of social welfare programs, open attacks on unions, and routine violations of labor laws.\"[vii] As an ideology, it casts all dimensions of life in terms of market rationality, construes profit making as the arbiter and essence of democracy, consuming as the only operable form of citizenship, and upholds the irrational belief that the market can both solve all problems and serve as a model for structuring all social relations. As a mode of governance, it produces identities, subjects, and ways of life driven by a survival-of-the fittest-ethic, grounded in the idea of the free, possessive individual, and committed to the right of ruling groups and institutions to exercise power removed from matters of ethics and social costs. As a policy and political project, it is wedded to the privatization of public services, the dismantling of the connection of private issues and public problems, the selling off of state functions, liberalization of trade in goods and capital investment, the eradication of government regulation of financial institutions and corporations, the destruction of the welfare state and unions, and the endless marketization and commodification of society.\n\nNothing engenders the wrath of conservatives more than the existence of the government providing a universal safety net, especially one that works, such as either Medicare or Social Security. As Yates points out, government is viewed by capitalists as an institution that gets in the way of capital. One result is a weakening of social programs and provisions. As Paul Krugman observes regarding the ongoing conservative attacks on Medicare, \"The real reason conservatives want to do away with Medicare has always been political: It's the very idea of the government providing a universal safety net that they hate, and they hate it even more when such programs are successful.\"[viii] In opposition to Krugman and other liberal economists, Michael Yates argues rightly in this book that the issue is not simply preserving Medicare but eliminating the predatory system that disavows equality of wealth, power, opportunity, and health care for everyone.\n\nNeoliberalism has put an enormous effort into creating a commanding cultural apparatus and public pedagogy in which individuals can only view themselves as consumers, embrace freedom as the right to participate in the market, and supplant issues of social responsibility for an unchecked embrace of individualism and the belief that all social relation be judged according to how they further one's individual needs and self-interests. Matters of mutual caring, respect, and compassion for the other have given way to the limiting orbits of privatization and unrestrained self-interest, just as it is has become increasingly difficult to translate private troubles into larger social, economic, and political considerations. One consequence is that it has become more difficult for people to debate and question neoliberal hegemony and the widespread misery it produces for young people, the poor, middle class, workers, and other segments of society- now considered disposable under neoliberal regimes which are governed by a survival-of-the fittest ethos, largely imposed by the ruling economic and political elite. Unable to make their voices heard and lacking any viable representation in the process makes clear the degree to which the American public, in particular, are suffering under a democratic deficit producing a profound dissatisfaction that does not always translate into an understanding of how neoliberal capitalism has destroyed democracy or what it might mean to understand and challenge its diverse apparatuses of persuasion and power. Clearly, the surge of popularity behind the presidential candidacy of a buffoon such as Donald Trump testifies to both a deep seated desire for change and the forms it can take when emotion replaces reason and any viable analysis of capitalism and its effects seem to be absent from a popular sensibility.\n\nWhat Michael Yates makes clear in this incisive book on inequality is that democratic values, commitments, integrity, and struggles are under assault from a wide range of sites in an age of intensified violence and disposability. Throughout the book he weaves a set of narratives and critiques in which he lays bare the anti-democratic tendencies that are on display in a growing age of lawlessness and disposability. He not only makes clear that inequality is not good for the economy, social bonds, the environment, politics, and democracy, Yates also argues that capitalism in the current historical moment is marked by an age that thrives on racism, xenophobia, the purported existence of an alleged culture of criminality, and a massive system of inequality that affects all aspects of society. Worth repeating is that at the center of this book, unlike so many others tackling inequality, is an attempt to map a number of modalities that give shape and purpose to widespread disparities in wealth and income, including the underlying forces behind inequality, how it works to secure class power, how it undermines almost every viable foundation needed for a sustainable democracy, and what it might mean to develop a plan of action to produce the radical imagination and corresponding modes of agency and practice that can think and act outside of the reformist politics of capitalism.\n\nUnlike so many other economists such as Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz who address the issue of inequality, Yates refuses the argument that the system is simply out of whack and can be fixed. Nor does he believe that capitalism can be described only in terms of economic structures. Capitalism is both a symbolic pathological economy that produces particular dispositions, values, and identities as well as oppressive institutional apparatuses and economic structures. Yates goes even further arguing that capitalism is not only about authoritarian ideologies and structures, it is also about the crisis of ideas, agency, and the failure of people to react to the suffering of others and to the conditions of their own oppression. Neoliberal capitalism has no language for human suffering, moral evaluation, and social responsibility. Instead, it creates a survival-of-the fittest ethos buttressed by a discourse that is morally insensitive, sadistic, cannibalistic, and displays a hatred of those whose labor cannot be exploited, do not buy into the consumerist ethic, or are considered other by virtue of their race, class, and ethnicity. Neoliberalism is the discourse of shadow games, committed to highlighting corporate power and making invisible the suffering of others, all the while leaving those considered disposable in the dark to fend for themselves.\n\nYates makes visible not only the economic constraints that bear down on the poor and disposable in the neoliberal age of precarity, he also narrates the voices, conditions, hardships and suffering workers have to endure in a variety of occupations ranging from automobile workers and cruise ship workers to those who work in restaurants and as harvester on farms. He provides a number of invaluable statistics that chart the injuries of class and race under capitalism but rather than tell a story with only statistics and mind boggling data, he also provides stories that give flesh to the statistics that mark a new historical conjuncture and a wide range of hardships that render work for most people hell and produce what has been called the hidden injuries of class. Much of what he writes is informed by a decade long research trip across the United States in which he attempted to see first-hand what the effects of capitalism have been on peoples' lives, the environment, work, unions, and other crucial spheres that inform everyday life. His keen eye is particularly riveting as he describes his teaming up with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers in the 1970s and his growing disappointment with a union that increasingly betrayed its own principles.\n\nFor Yates, the capitalist system is corrupt, malicious, and needs to be replaced. Capitalism leaves no room for the language of justice, the social, or, for that matter, democracy itself. In fact, one of its major attributes is to hide its effects of power, racial injustice, militarized state violence, domestic terrorism, and new forms of disposability, especially regarding those marginalized by class and race. The grotesque inequalities produced by capitalism are too powerful, deeply rooted in the social and economic fabric, and unamenable to liberal reforms. Class disparities constitute a machinery of social death, a kind of zombie-like machine that drains life out of most of the population poisoning both existing and future generations.\n\nThe politics of disposability has gone mainstream as more and more individuals and groups are now considered surplus and vulnerable, consigned to zones of abandonment, surveillance, and incarceration. At one level, the expansive politics of disposability can be seen in the rising numbers of homeless, the growing army of debt-ridden students, the increasingly harsh treatment of immigrants, the racism that fuels the school-to-prison pipeline, and the growing attack on public servants. On another level, the politics of disposability has produced a culture of lawlessness and cruelty evident by the increasing rollback of voting rights, the war waged against women's reproductive rights, laws that discriminate against gays, the rise of the surveillance state, and the growing militarization of local police forces. Yates argues convincingly that there is a desperate need for a new language for politics, solidarity, shared responsibilities, and democracy itself. Yates sees in the now largely departed Occupy Movement an example of a movement that used a new discourse and set of slogans to highlight inequality, make class inequities visible, and to showcase the workings of power in the hands of the financial elite. For Yates, Occupy provided a strategy that can be and is being emulated by a number of groups, especially those emerging in the black community in opposition to police violence. Such a strategy begins by asking what a real democracy looks like and how does it compare to the current society in which we live. One precondition for individual and social agency is that the horizons for change must transcend the parameters of the existing society, and the future must be configured in such a way as to not mimic the present.\n\nWhat is remarkable about The Great Inequality is that Yates does not simply provide a critique of capitalism in its old and new forms, he also provides a discourse of possibility developed around a number of suggested policies and practices designed to not reform capitalism but to abolish it. This is a book that follows in the manner of Dr. Martin Luther King's call to break the silence. In it Yates functions as a moral witness in reporting on the hardships and suffering produced by grotesque forms of inequality. As such, he reveals the dark threats that capitalism in its ruthlessly updated versions poses to the planet. Yet, his narrative is never far from either hope or a sense that there is a larger public for whom his testimony matters and that such a public is capable of collective resistance. The Great Inequality also serves to enliven the ethical imagination, and speak out for those populations now considered outcast and voiceless. Yates provides a furious reading of inequality and the larger structure of capitalism. In doing so he exhibits a keen and incisive intellect along with a welcomed sense of righteous fury.\n\n[ii] Giorgio Agamben, \"The Security State and a theory of destituent power,\" Philosophers for Change, (February 25, 2014).

Let us assume, merely for the sake of argument, that Trump and Cruz do not score highly in the first two categories. What passions, then, what psychological or emotional forces, might explain their support? While no single answer will prove dispositive, a particular social psychology theory proves surprisingly illuminating -- a theory, paradoxically enough, that I have developed in my research into radical Islamism.\n\nCertain communities identify themselves as \"chosen\" for momentous greatness, as slated to play singular, imperative roles in world history. The umma (Muslim world) and contemporary America are two of many communities, broadly defined, that for historical reasons have forged identities with such high self-regard. In Islam there is a necessary link between religiosity and worldly power and success. Muhammad founded a religion and an empire, which lasted for a millennium. Jews and Christians, by comparison, experienced existential crises early on in their histories and, as a result, developed narratives whereby God regularly tests his people with hardship or exists in a realm separate from man's tribulations -- the Kingdom of Heaven. Less so in Islam.\n\nThe story, when you squint hard enough, is not all that dissimilar in America. Since the very beginning, America has conceived of itself as exceptional in its moral purity and possibility, as the \"City on a Hill\" in the Puritan leader John Winthrop's grand vision. At least since World War II, though, after which its economy represented a full one-half of the world's GDP, America has augmented this moral self-conception to incorporate the ideal that it is also destined for, and indeed entitled to, greatness and power on Earth, down in the valley below the Hill. Cruz agrees, citing the victories in the Revolutionary War and World War II, and the fall of the Berlin Wall, as proof that \"from the dawn of this country, at every stage America has enjoyed God's providential blessing.\"\n\nWhen such a \"chosen\" community declines, the theory continues, cognitive dissonance can emerge: How could we, the necessarily greatest community, be weak or even non-dominant? The umma has been living with this confusion for centuries. As Sayyid Abul A'la Mawdudi, one of radical Islamism's mid-20th century founders, sermonized: \"Your honor, which no one dared to touch, is now being trampled upon. ... You are Muslims and yet are slaves! This situation is impossible as it is for an object to be white and black.\" Many Americans similarly, if usually more subtly, worry about their nation's descent from Cold War titan to post-recession \"leader from behind.\" In his book Time to Get Tough! Making America #1 Again, however, Trump is characteristically unsubtle: \"The country I love is a total economic disaster right now. We have become a laughingstock, the world's whipping boy, blamed for everything, credited for nothing, given no respect. You see and feel it all around you, and so do I.\"\n\nWhen presented with such a dissonant reality, the theory concludes, at least two explanations can safeguard the community's sense of \"choseness.\" Trump embodies the first, and Cruz the second. Radical Islamists employ both.\n\nThe first is an appeal to conspiracy theories. Furtive, evil, abnormal, foreign forces have intervened to keep the community's greatness at bay, goes the argument. The community is thereby not ultimately responsible for any of its failures, and thus there is no need to downgrade its identity, which has been suppressed unnaturally. Greatness will blossom again, almost as a matter of logical or scientific necessity, once the community sheds the conspiracies. This is the essence of Trump's message. To \"Make America Great Again,\" we must kick and keep out those outsiders responsible for our malaise -- Muslims and, especially, Hispanics. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems,\" Trump said about Mexico. \"And they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" Trump proposes few specific policies beyond deporting all 11 million undocumented Hispanics currently living in the U.S. (and then repatriating the \"good ones\"), building a wall on the Mexican border, and banning all Muslim visitors to the U.S.\n\nThe second explanation is an appeal to ideological purity. It responds to the worry that the period of decline has disproven the connection between the community's identity and worldly greatness, between, say, American-ness and American supremacy. The explanation is that, to the contrary, the decline has demonstrated that the community has neglected its identity. And only when the community recommits itself to the values at the core of this identity will power and prosperity return. This is Cruz's proposed solution. \"What is the promise of America?\" Cruz asked at the speech at Liberty University announcing his candidacy. \"The revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon is that our rights don't come from man. They come from God Almighty. And that the purpose of the Constitution, as Thomas Jefferson put it, is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government.\" If we revert to the core values of God and small government, Mr. Cruz argues, not only will we restore our moral purity, but our political problems will evaporate -- for instance, \"instead of economic stagnation, booming economic growth.\" \"The power of the American people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds,\" Cruz concluded.\n\nRadical Islamists, meanwhile, appeal to both narratives, blaming Muslim decline on the \"Zionist-Crusader\" conspiracy, and arguing that by returning to the perceived core of Islam, which they interpret wildly into a totalitarian ideology, Muslims can restore their relative political power. As much a map to Heaven, radical Islamism conceives of itself as a rulebook for social and political success on Earth.\n\nNow, the point here is not to draw a moral equivalence between Trump, Cruz, and radical Islamists. So far from it. Which \"outsiders\" are blamed, and what constitutes the community's perceived ideological center, will vary dramatically. European right-wing parties, for instance, generally combine anti-immigrant sentiment with a commitment to a stronger welfare state (for non-immigrants only).\n\nThe point is rather that these social psychological forces are influential in \"chosen\" communities, like contemporary America, when their power wanes. It is no surprise, accordingly, that the conservative voters hit hardest and longest by the recession, who have experienced American decline most vividly and personally, support Trump and Cruz disproportionally. For Trump and Cruz provide a method of processing this decline without giving up one inch of American exceptionalism.

Here we have two books, both searing eyewitness accounts of past ideological fanaticism written by eminent Chinese intellectuals, that clearly fit the description of \"historical nihilism,\" though, Ji Xianlin's \"The Cowshed\" was actually published in China a couple of decades ago, when things were a bit looser than they are today.\n\nThere is virtually no possibility, however, that Fang Lizhi's \"The Most Wanted Man in China,\" marvelously, idiomatically translated by Perry Link, will be published in China. Fang, who died in 2012, was for a quarter of a century probably his country's most famous scientist. Like Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident with whom he is often compared, he was a powerful advocate of the notion of universal human rights (another concept barred by the aforementioned \"Communiqu\u00e9\"). After the bloody crackdown on the student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, also a physicist, were named the chief \"black hands behind the turmoil.\" The couple took refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing, where they remained until they were allowed to leave for permanent exile in the United States 13 months later. It was mostly during that time in the embassy, constantly worried that he could be seized and abducted, that Fang wrote his memoir.\n\nBut though composed in the heat and terror of a dangerous moment, this is a remarkably cool, precise and in places even good-humored book; Fang generally prefers to lampoon China's authoritarian bureaucracy than to dwell on his own suffering. The book reflects its author in this sense -- a skeptical rationalist and a brave man who, it turns out, was also a fine writer with an irreverent and sometimes poetic touch. Fang's underlying theme is the fundamental incompatibility between science and the kind of faith in their own infallibility demanded by the China's leaders, and his book is a manifesto of the sort Galileo might have written had he been a Chinese physicist in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nFang's book recounts his entire life, from his origins in a small-business family from the fabled city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province to his departure from China in 1990 -- after which he taught physics at the University of Arizona until his death at the age of 76. He covers all the major twists and turns of the Maoist regime up to 1989, providing learned, witty digressions on a host of topics from the importance of banquet scenes in Peking opera to what Fang calls the \"hallucinatory megalomania in Communist culture,\" though he readily admits that, like many Chinese intellectuals, he was for years a true believer in Chinese socialism and the greatness of the Chairman.\n\nBut here is where science came in, science and what Fang calls the \"subversive\" effect of its basic requirements -- \"free inquiry, a spirit of skepticism and reliance on evidence.\" Galileo himself came to Fang's mind in 1973, when he wrote a paper on modern cosmology that the authorities attacked as \"bourgeois\" and \"depraved,\" thereby establishing a kind of doppelg\u00e4nger relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the medieval Catholic Church. Ridiculous though it may seem in the 20th century, post-Einstein theories of the universe contradicted some (incorrect) jottings by Engels -- which leads Fang to note, \"No one who understands physics can turn around and accept a claim that Marxism-Leninism is special wisdom that trumps everything else.\"\n\nHere and there, Fang's account \u00adwaxes lyrical, as when he describes the late stages of the Cultural Revolution when he labored in a coal mine in southern Anhui Province. A new political turn had led to a surge of suicides among former Red Guards. Physics students stood watch at the local morgue to keep wild dogs away from the fresh corpses, and these grim circumstances imparted to Fang a profound love of astrophysics. \"What could match the divine purity of a firmament packed densely and deeply with stars -- and also wash away the stench of wild dogs haunting a morgue?\" he writes.\n\nIt is statements like that, combined with Fang's international prestige, that will surely exclude his book from China. Ji Xianlin's haunting \"The Cowshed,\" however, which focuses on the 10-year period of the Cultural Revolution, was published in the People's Republic in 1992 and remains in print, though as Zha Jianying points out in her informative introduction, \"the authorities also quietly took steps to restrict public discussion of the memoir, as its subject continues to be treated as sensitive.\" Ji, who died in 2009 at the age of 97, was a German-educated scholar of Pali and Sanskrit. Like Fang, he supported the Communist revolution, but less critically, and in his memoir, he confesses some shame over his obedience to the party's authority. \"I never once gave a thought to the feelings of the people wearing hats,\" he admits -- meaning the people singled out by Mao for national condemnation, people whom Ji duly criticized in China's Orwellian rituals.\n\nJi had a rude awakening when the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966, and he found himself wearing the \"hat\" of a \"reactionary capitalist academic authority.\" Before he knew it, he was a victim of one of Mao's chief contributions to 20th-century totalitarian practice, the \"struggle session,\" during which, over a period of weeks and months, the targeted person was harangued, humiliated, starved and beaten in front of mobs howling slogans.\n\nAt the center of Ji's account, ably translated by Chenxin Jiang, is the \"cowshed\" of the title. This was a makeshift prison of the sort built all over China at the time to house inmates undergoing \"reform through labor,\" in Ji's case on the very campus of Peking University. His description of this institution, really a kind of mini concentration camp, is unforgettable. Other writers, including Fang, have described the Cultural Revolution largely as a massive waste of time during which atrocities were frequent. For Ji, the atrocities themselves, the savage excesses, the sadism and the infliction of pain were the intentional points of the exercise, whose perpetrators were encouraged in the belief that the more brutal they were, the more admirably \"revolutionary\" they could claim to be.\n\nReaders of books on China have over the years been presented with a mounting body of material about the cruelty and destructiveness of the Communist revolution, from the takeover of power in 1949 to the military crackdown against the Tiananmen protesters in 1989. What these two books show in their sober, elegiac way is that it was even worse than we thought.", "\"ABOARD THE PAPAL AIRLINER -- Inserting himself into the Republican presidential race, Pope Francis on Wednesday suggested that Donald J. Trump 'is not Christian' because of the harshness of his campaign promises to deport more immigrants and force Mexico to pay for a wall along the border.\"\n\n-- Jim Yardley, New York Times\n\nThis is, of course, a colloquial and rhetorical question, in response to a question where the answer is an obvious yes. I could imagine Wm. F. Buckley, Jr., a serious if not devout Catholic, posing this question, in jest, only partly, to open a dialogue. The godfather of American conservatism, Bill would likely opine that the answer to whether Francis should intrude into an America political campaign is, sorry, an emphatic no.\n\nLike many, I admire the inspiration and passion of Pope Francis. He is truly concerned for the poor and the suffering and speaks eloquently to the dignity of each person. In reaching out to the impoverished and the forgotten, he is humble and caring and sets an inspired example. But in matters of economics and politics, he is, at best, uninformed. His primary acquaintance with capitalism is the oligarchy within his native Argentina, bearing little resemblance to a classic free market. Francis routinely attributes income inequality to greed, because he does not understand how a free market can uplift the poor. Instead, he seems to ally himself with Marxists who would coerce income redistribution.\n\nWithin this paradigm, the pontiff now intervenes in an American election. On CNN Rev. James Martin, S.J., editor at large of America magazine, defended Francis for his criticism of Donald Trump. The pontiff was, Martin said, only expressing that the Christian view is to \"care for the stranger,\" because Christianity is \"not an us and a them.\" But Martin's true agenda emerged when he talked about \"trying to help the poor\" through an open borders policy.\n\nMartin agreed with CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the Pope \"must have known\" the impact of his words. Blitzer noted that while the six-day Mexican trip was long planned, the visit to the Mexican border was added. But by whom and why? Martin could not say, before he dismissed the whole matter as the Pope simply \"going to people on the periphery.\" But if the Pope were not a pawn, as Trump said, did he orchestrate his own political gambit?\n\nThe border visit, Martin asserted, reflected a priority of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Blitzer did not press the political implications. We already know that Big Business wants immigrants for cheap labor and to keep the wages of others down. Also, for years Catholic clerics have colluded with politicians in the Democratic Party. The Church gains new parishioners, and the Democrats, who demonize Republicans, gain bloc voters. This has happened in Southern California, where I live. Former Cardinal Roger Mahony allied himself with power brokers in the Democratic Party to support a massive influx of Hispanics, overwhelmingly Catholic, to repopulate the Catholic parishes.\n\nIt is not a non sequitur to this discussion to point out: under Mahony, priests engaged in predatory sexual attacks against young children. I am acquainted with those in law enforcement who investigated Mahony. As in the Boston archdiocese scandal popularized in the Academy Award nominated film Spotlight, the most enraged detectives and empowered prosecutors and dedicated investigative reporters were themselves Catholic. Due to the statute of limitations, the \"progressive\" Mahony narrowly escaped prosecution for repeatedly covering up these horrific crimes. Many of the victims were children from the poor Mexican families that Mahony supposedly championed.\n\nPope Francis this week did not confront the realities of a corrupt Mexican government at the highest levels, though he did address the nation's rampant violence and drug trafficking. He could have said even more about the terrorism of the drug czars, the intimidation of farmers forced to pay protection, the wave of kidnappings, and especially the exploitation of workers by crony capitalists with government franchises. Did he consider how a real free market and economic development could help the people in Mexico, so they would not leave? Did he express the need for the rule of law, in Mexico and at the border?\n\nInstead the Pope focused on a nonexistent wall, a contentious issue in an ongoing American election.\n\n\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" the Pope observed on the Papal aircraft, departing Mexico. \"This is not in the gospel.\" The Pope's defenders suggest his words be judged in context, that he was only answering a question. But will the Pope next lecture us on, say, Donald Trump's views on free trade and tariffs?\n\nThe Pope effectively allowed Trump to occupy the high ground. \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful,\" Trump, now seemingly a victim of the Pope's excess, read from a statement he then released. \"I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked....\"\n\nI am not a theologian, not even a Catholic. Those two disqualifications aside, I observe: (1) countries have legitimate and legally traversable borders, the integrity of which is not fair game for Francis; (2) there are reasonable arguments for and against this particular wall, about which arguments Francis appears unknowing, and not curious; (3) allegory aside, the Pope's observation thus is not metaphorical, but specific, and political: his invocation of the gospel is disheartening, implausible.\n\nDonald Trump's proposed wall should be debated on its merits in the political realm, but it is not \"not Christian.\" Note that \"walls\" are things that Francis cannot condemn \"wherever they may be.\" A wall protects Vatican City. But the Communists built the Berlin Wall to enslave people in totalitarianism. President Ronald Reagan, not as part of a religious revival, helped bring it down. Israel built a wall to keep terrorists out. Bibi Netanyahu, not as part of religious bigotry, champions that barrier against barbarians.\n\nAnd barbarians abound in the neighborhood of the Middle East. It is peculiar that in this day and age, when Christians, especially there, suffer discrimination and persecution, assault and rape, torture and murder, as part of an ethnic -- shall we more accurately say, religious -- cleansing, that the world is apathetic. For example, the United Nations refugee camps discriminate against Christians, in favor of Muslims, though many Arab countries will not even accept their fellow Muslims. And yet the U.S. under President Obama has accepted refugees in this ratio, 97 percent Muslim, 3 percent Christian.\n\nWhere is the Pope on this? Should the West accept masses of Muslims, a significant portion of whom believe in forced conversion of Christians?\n\nIt's wise that we should not inflame or exacerbate religious wars, or play to the Islamist caricature of \"crusaders.\" But ISIS and other extremists in the name of Islam are brutalizing girls and women and beheading Christians, as Trump points out regularly. Is it moral for us to obsess, instead, about the need to accommodate the West to Muslims, many of whom repudiate Western values and the Judeo-Christian ethos? This same Pope has made only limited calls for Arab nations to help their brothers. Does he think he's going to convert Muslims to Catholicism?\n\nIn short, is it \"Christian\" to turn the other cheek and not confront Islamo-Fascists?\n\nNo wonder Trump scored points, turning the table against the Pope. \"When the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy,\" the extemporaneous Trump said, reading directly from a rare written statement, \"I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now...\"\n\nYet, amidst all this, Francis, like brother Obama, seems more concerned with, for example, the unsettled but alleged certainty of presumed catastrophic global warming. (Yesterday, CNN commentator Father Charles Beck observed that Donald Trump was alienating liberal Catholics because he did not recognize \"climate change.\") Outside of almost every aspect of long-held Church doctrine (abortion perhaps the most prominent example) in which Francis and President Obama disagree, the transformational Pope and transformational president seem to be in the same political caucus.\n\nLike progressive Christians, like reform Jews, like fallen away Catholics, and like secular humanists, the two egalitarians -- the pontiff and the president -- believe that government must violate the commandment of \"thou shall not steal\" to redistribute income. Neither man understands how to nurture economic growth to ameliorate poverty. Francis fails to grasp that nation-states have borders that are part of that dreaded secular world. And President Obama, we already know, believes American exceptionalism is a heresy.\n\nIn that universalism, the Pope's trip to the line separating the United States and Mexico for a cross-border Mass was not an exercise in spirituality. It was a political act. The United States is a generous nation open to immigrants, but when it comes to what the laws and procedures should be, and how they should be addressed politically, the Pope is a foreigner interfering in our sovereignty and in our election. Yet the Pope, returning from Mexico, was like a candidate on a campaign plane holding a media availability. One hopes he will have the wisdom to reflect and move beyond the fray, and not return to it.\n\nThe Pope is a man of prodigious intelligence. So he was disingenuous when he said, \"...about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that.\" Francis knew he had attacked a candidate in an election in the United States. Worse, Francis added: \"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that.\"\n\nDonald Trump is not humble. But the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Catholics has now assumed a Trump-like stance. Instead of walking back his presumption, Francis defended himself with a sound bite: \"Thank God he said I was a politician because Aristotle defined the human person as 'animal politicus.' So at least I am a human person.\"\n\nClearly the pontiff is not a political strategist. His outburst is a gift to Trump that will keep giving. The pope's words will help Trump, not because, as implied by some mainstream media, South Carolina evangelical voters are anti-Catholic bigots. Many Catholics do not follow the Church on doctrinal matters; does the Pope expect them to follow him on politics? Catholics are about one-fifth of the American electorate and some Catholics will now opt for Trump to show their independence. You will now see some prominent Catholics endorse Trump. Meanwhile, the overall electorate (including Trump's targeted Republican voters) sees another Establishment figure, no less than the Pope, in hyperbolic mode against the politically incorrect Trump.\n\n\"As to whether I am a pawn [of the Mexican government], well, maybe, I don't know,\" Francis continued in response to Trump \"I'll leave that up to your judgment and that of the people.\" Here is the Pope as polemicist a few days before the South Carolina primary. This is not a dialogue that benefits Francis, only Donald.\n\nTrump was wrong to question the faith of Seventh Day Adventist Ben Carson and Southern Baptist Ted Cruz. But that's Trump. The Holy Father is held, shall we say, to a higher standard. Mario Rubio is a Catholic from birth, but he pointed out the border is not just about immigrants but also about terrorism. Rubio said, \"We are a sovereign country and we control who comes in, just like Vatican City controls who comes into the Vatican.\" Jeb Bush is a convert to Catholicism. In this controversy, Jeb has taken the high road, which is the right thing for him (and anyone else) to do. \"Christianity is between him and his creator,\" Jeb said about Trump. Showing class, Jeb continued, \"I don't question anybody's Christianity.\"", "The foundation of compensations for properties of Jewish religious communities wants its administrative costs covered by the money received from the state.

Apple argues that, far from protecting a terrorist, it is upholding a principle which millions of iPhone owners value - their right to privacy and especially invasive snooping by the state.\n\nThe company's chief executive, Tim Cook, stated forcefully that it would fight the court because it was being asked to create a skeleton key that would be prized by criminal hackers and totalitarian regimes.\n\nThe FBI, which wants the contents of the phone, argues that criminals should not be protected by technology. The agency is determined to learn whether the San Bernadino phone user was in contact with Islamic State operatives, and whether the lives of other innocent Americans could be in jeopardy.\n\nThe judge in the case upheld the US Justice Department's application to disable the phone's ironclad security. Somewhat quaintly, given that the case involves cutting edge technology, an 18th century law came into play in the court's judgment. Government lawyers relied on the All Writs Act, a law that says courts can require that people do things to comply with their orders.\n\nThe case is a potential flashpoint in the clash of technology and privacy, and the balance between national security and individual rights. Apple, having drawn a line in the sand, has upped the stakes with US authorities who want the firm to install software on the phone that would save its contents and permit the FBI to 'brute force' the phone - jargon for cracking the password without deleting data on the device.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, the request does not require Apple to redesign its products or disable the phone's encryption. The software, it said, would operate only on the iPhone5C used by Syed Rizwan Farook in his murderous assault last December. Technical experts say Apple can do what federal authorities want - the argument in America is whether the demand is reasonable.\n\nThe case is a potential flashpoint in the clash of technology and privacy, and the balance between national security and individual rights. Apple, having drawn a line in the sand, has upped the stakes with US authorities.\n\nThe stand taken by Mr Cook differs from Apple's position barely three years ago when it and other Silicon Valley firms were accused by whistleblower Edward Snowden of standing by while US and UK spy agencies routinely tapped into their databases. Now the Apple boss is championing the constitutional rights of its customers to privacy - a stand which happily coincides with Apple's commercial interests.\n\nGiven the stakes involved, it is unsurprising that competing interests in this dispute are engaged in a fight for the moral high ground. But it should not be beyond the parties to construct a solution that at once preserves hard-won privacy rights and limits law enforcement authorities to the San Bernadino case, rather than, as Mr Cook argues, handing them a key to Apple's universe. In this country, when matters of national security have come before the courts, special advocates have been appointed to sift through sensitive material and offer an independent view of whether it could be released. The approach appears to have satisfied security interests, the rights of defendants and prosecuting lawyers.\n\nWhen all the posturing in the San Bernadino case is set aside, it should be possible to examine the phone's contents, without exposing every smartphone owner to prying eyes.", "A heartless subscriber to neoclassical economics. A spineless pimp of the prison-industrial complex. On the plus side, he did helm a future (1996!) in which Manhattan was an affordable place to live. But Donald Pleasence's no-name president needed the help of a notorious prisoner just to escape from his own accidental incarceration.\n\nPoliticians love talking about how they're tough on crime, especially when patronizing white middle-class voters. Richard Nixon branded himself a \"law and order\" candidate amid the Watts riots in 1968. During the 1988 presidential race, the same issue served as one of several nails in Michael Dukakis' coffin when George H.W. Bush unleashed a horrifyingly racist Willie Horton attack ad. Bill Clinton established his \"tough on crime\" stance when, as governor of Arkansas, he personally oversaw the execution of a brain damaged death row inmate right before the 1992 New Hampshire primary. He further cemented his position by introducing his infamous \"three strikes\" crime bill during his presidency, mandating life sentences for people convicted of two previous felonies.\n\nDonald Pleasence, who played the commander-in-chief in John Carpenter's 1981 classic \"Escape from New York,\" would laugh at Clinton's crime bill. The fictitious chief did away with any sort of previous felonies requirement and just tossed any arbitrary convict into an island-size jail for the rest of their natural born life. It's also probably safe to assume that legal protocols such as due process and habeas corpus were cast aside. But whatever: The rest of the law-abiding populace was kept safe.\n\nGetting shipped off to a pre-Giuliani Manhattan island is basically the equivalent to being eternally damned, which is probably why the paperwork that would guarantee Snake Plissken's freedom looks like an afterthought. Does this piece of paper look like an ironclad binding legal document or did Plissken just win his grade school's perfect attendance award?\n\nAlso, check out that giant wall barricading the prison. You know who else is really into walls keeping undesirables off of our unsullied shores?\n\nYou never see America outside of the Manhattan prison and its bordering command centers, but this statistic in the opening pretty much encapsulates the president's interest in community safety:\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint one reason why crime would skyrocket, but most eggheads would indicate the lack of economic resources and working-class opportunities to sustain a civil society. Thus we can safely assume the president subscribed to Reaganomics and dismantled budgets for national infrastructure involving welfare, education, healthcare, and the like.\n\nRather, those funds were diverted to the defense budget to aid in the development of full-armored faceplates for prison guards.\n\nNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\n\nIs the president over 35 years old? He certainly appears so. Is he a natural born citizen? Not with that blimey British accent. We can sit here and debate the reasons for which a native-born American president might have developed an accent while overseas as a military brat or some posh scion shipped off to some Harry Potter rich kid boarding school -- perhaps the same way we can debate whether a Canadian-born car salesman is eligible for office. However, it's safe to assume that the Constitution was bypassed out of an increasing turn towards totalitarianism. That much is clear due to the fact that the president's successor (\"Escape from L.A.'s\" Cliff Robertson) elected himself as president-for-life just three years after the events of \"Escape from New York\" and went so far as to outlaw Islam as part of the new \"Moral America.\" Frankly, banning Islam sounds like something almost any of the current crop of GOP White House hopefuls would gleefully enforce.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, British actor Pleasence came up with his own character backstory, wherein the United States returned to colony status after Margaret Thatcher made a grandiose global power grab, but director Carpenter dismissed this out of hand. If The Horror Master wants to put Pleasence in his movie, then he's gonna put Pleasence in his damn movie, context and exposition be damned.\n\nDespite the militarization of the police force, we can admit that there are some gaping holes in law enforcement agencies' keeping American safe from both internal terror and foreign adversaries. For starters, a gaggle of Symbionese Liberation Army-style terrorists dubbed the National Liberation Front of America managed to highjack Air Force One and take the president hostage, not to mention crash the plane into a building near the World Trade Center. Granted, actual terrorists did manage to crash two aircrafts into the WTC on George W. Bush's watch back in 2001, but you'd at least imagine the president's jet would come with a few extra layers of security.\n\nSpeaking of security, for as high-tech as the Statue of Liberty Security Island is supposed to be, it's slightly crazy that the key to world peace and diffusing doomsday-level tensions between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union and China is on the same kind of mixtape that I used to tape The Cure songs off the radio back in the early '90s.\n\nHell, even Hauk's ridiculous cellphone looks more secure than a 90-minute Maxell tape.

After all, in the game of politics, optics are everything.\n\nYou gotta look impeccable for when a grizzled anti-hero wearing an eyepatch tanks your entire political career, and maybe the fate of world peace, on live TV.", "Terrorists do not respect the basic rights of all fellow humans and in fact believe in the very opposite.\n\nThe social phenomenon of violent acts of terrorism has an intellectual and behavioural context that needs to be objectively analysed without prejudice. Many would argue that the way to counter acts of terrorism is to address the supposed grievances that arise from deprivation of civil rights, human rights and democracy. Then is the deliberate targeting of civilians, to indiscriminately murder and maim innocent children, women and men, not the deprivation of such rights? If it were not, then national and international conflicts and struggles for civil rights, human rights and democracy by using violence may be justified by extremist and terror groups. This mindset is most dangerous.\n\nMahatma Gandhi's struggle for a free India and Martin Luther King's campaign for equal rights for all Americans strongly denounced all forms of hatred and oppression especially violence. Besides military strategies to counter violence by communist insurgents, Sir Gerald Templer most notably succeeded in the nationwide campaign against these insurgents by \"winning the hearts and minds of the people\" especially the supporters during the emergency era in Malaysia.\n\nPerhaps due to the lack of intellectual and objective reasoning by terror groups, thus, the only known strategy to gain support for its irrational cause is by utilising violence and imposing extreme fear on children, men and women. Put simply, that's why they are terrorists and not champions of social order and justice. Champions of civil and human rights are proponents in the sanctity of each human life, are committed to the ideals of liberty, and the values of democracy.\n\nTerrorists do not respect the basic rights of all fellow humans. In fact, they believe in the very opposite. Unfortunately, terror groups use religion as an anchor to champion their cause. They legitimise their unthinkable acts of violence in the name of religion and God. They operate on the principle of destroying anything that falls on their chosen path and their biggest obstruction is innocent civilians regardless of colour, creed or religion. They blatantly discard all moral code, social norms and values established since early civilisation. Not only do they rampantly and indiscriminately kill fellow humans but if possible, eliminate cultures that have existed for centuries. In their perspective, they are saviours and their doctrine totalitarianism. Maybe the doctrine of totalitarianism justifies the root causes of terrorism. They want to decide what is right and wrong, good and bad for all mankind. They do not want people who think, who question, who criticise and who analyse. Totalitarian governments will systemically brainwash its subjects. They will never allow the moral consciousness of people to exist or prevail. They will suppress and oppress all rational thinking processes and actions. Individuals will cease to exist. The concept of civil societies will be buried.\n\nThose who identify themselves with terror groups and participate in terror acts will rule as terrorists. They will never protect freedom, liberty and human rights. Tyranny without any doubt will prevail through dictatorship when a terrorist group becomes the ruling government. Only in totalitarian governments under tyranny rule can the culture of terrorism flourish and expand.\n\nDemocratic nations must courageously take measures to eliminate all forms terrorism. We act for the sake of humanity, freedom and democratic rights. Pluralism must be respected. We must not allow terrorism to breed in our sovereign nations. Terrorism will never be able to flourish in nations where civil rights, human rights and democracy are strongly grounded and protected by the people and the government. The respect and dignity for fellow humans must be constantly observed and practised. Thus, we must without fear condemn all form of terrorist acts especially when such acts are carried out in the name of religion and God.\n\nWe live freely and we die freely and this must remain constant.\n\nP Sundramoorthy in on the research team of Crime and Policing, School of Social Sciences at Universiti Sains Malaysia.", "From a Coen brothers caper to sci-fi thrills and literary drama, the Berlinale is full of coming attractions\n\nOne of the hotter tickets at this year's Berlin Film Festival -- and, curiously, one of the more topical, being the tale of an alien migrant -- was actually celebrating its 40th anniversary. Introduced by Tilda Swinton and screened in homage to the late David Bowie, Nicolas Roeg's poetic and artful sci-fi drama The Man Who Fell to Earth not only proved to be an atmospheric tribute to one of the city's more famous residents -- Bowie moved briefly to Sch\u00f6neberg in the late 1970s -- but a reminder of what this festival does best.\n\n\"It's only the Berlinale that would be doing this,\" noted Swinton, \"it's a cultural moment.\" Which was just as well, since the alternative -- prestige world premieres of the kind that Cannes, in a good year, can deliver on a daily basis -- was once again in short supply.\n\nThe festival kicked off with the Coen brothers' 1950s-set comedy Hail, Caesar!, which promised to be a vivacious, light-hearted flashback to American cinema's all-singing, all-dancing heyday. In reality, the Coens delivered something much darker; while hitting the same, sometimes hilarious, shaggy-dog notes as their cult hit The Big Lebowski, it turned out not to be a celebration of Hollywood's golden age but a critique of the tyranny of populism, anchored by Josh Brolin's beleaguered studio executive.\n\nIn exploring the trials of a man locked in the studio system, meeting the financial demands of his boss while juggling the needs of his flaky, stupid stars, the Coens hit on what would be one of the major themes of this year's festival: freedom.\n\nThe most subtle example of this would be Mia Hansen-Love's Things to Come (L'avenir), the French writer-director's low-key and wholly unexpected follow-up to last year's 1990s rave-era feature Eden. Isabelle Huppert stars in the new film as middle-aged philosophy teacher Nathalie, whose life comes unstuck when her demanding mother dies and her husband of 25 years reveals he has been having an affair.\n\nIt sounds like the stuff of dour drama, but Hansen-Love instead fashions a refreshingly resilient heroine who isn't at all fazed by these sudden absences in a once-cosy life. Not a great deal happens but the performance is what counts, showing just how exquisite an actor Huppert is and, most importantly, proving that women's stories don't need a token male love interest to succeed.\n\nLetting go of loved ones was also a surprising concern of the only other US fiction film in the main competition. Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, the Southern-based director of Shotgun Stories, Take Shelter and Mud, Midnight Special is, on the surface, an effects-laden sci-fi chase movie but at its heart a very well-dressed and elegant indie that continues to establish its creator as an evolving and versatile talent.\n\nWorking from a tight, spare script, Nichols regular Michael Shannon stars as Roy, the father of a little boy whose otherworldly powers pique the interest of the National Security Agency. On the run from a strange, Amish-like religious community that was once his home, and which treats the boy as a prophet, if not a deity, Roy must dodge government forces to deliver his son -- in a nod to Close Encounters of the Third Kind -- to a set of co-ordinates that will reveal his true identity. In other hands this would be pseudo-Christian mumbo-jumbo but Nichols and his cast keep things grounded, even moving, as the story zips to a wholly unexpected climax.\n\nOtherwise there was a very literary bent to this year's event. In an Out of Competition slot, Terence Davies followed last year's critical hit Sunset Song with something a little more divisive; based on the life of Emily Dickinson, A Quiet Passion stars Cynthia Nixon as the famously reclusive 19th-century American poet. Little is known concretely about Dickinson but Davies paints her as a fierce wit and, although this results in some very amusing zingers, the pace becomes annoyingly breakneck in a film that, visually, remains static.\n\nMore traditional was Vincent Perez's Alone in Berlin, a worthy if not especially worthwhile adaptation of Hans Fallada's 1947 novel, in which a blue-collar couple spread anti-Hitler propaganda in the German capital as a protest against the death of their rookie soldier son. There was a reverential hush for the film but despite the best efforts of its excellent cast -- Brendan Gleeson and Emma Thompson -- its attempts to create a sense of claustrophobic tension are at odds with the nebulousness of the \"mission\", which mostly involves leaving postcards in random locations.\n\nAnd it doesn't help to have the cast speak accented English while reading German, a weird device that is highlighted when Daniel Br\u00fchl's Nazi-employed detective refers to the famous Alexanderplatz as Alexander Square.\n\nA much better attempt at heritage cinema was Michael Grandage's Genius, a fitfully rousing Depression-set study of writer Thomas Wolfe (played with great physical delight by Jude Law) and his on-off mentor relationship with literary editor Max Perkins (Colin Firth). It flirts with the clich\u00e9s of the genre -- Wolfe is free jazz, Perkins strictly classical -- yet Genius skirts the usual biopic pitfalls thanks to a smart script by John Logan. Nevertheless, its A-list credentials seem a little heavy-handed, wasting Nicole Kidman in a role as Wolfe's bitter mistress and Laura Linney as Max's lesser-spotted and frequently neglected wife.\n\nIn the festival's Panorama section, similar artistic concerns were aired in two very different documentaries. In Aaron Brookner's Uncle Howard, the film-maker pays tribute to his uncle, an unsung hero of New York's 1980s art film scene. After making his debut with the first feature-length portrait of Beat writer William Burroughs, Howard Brookner made only one more documentary and one musical -- the Damon Runyon compendium Bloodhounds of Broadway, starring Matt Dillon and Madonna -- before dying of an Aids-related illness at 34. Pieced together from terrific archive footage, an inspiring picture emerges of a man who literally danced in the face of death, preferring to burn short and bright, making the most of the little time left to him.\n\nBritish duo Robert Cannan and Ross Adam's terrific film, The Lovers and the Despot, meanwhile, pursue a very different line of artistic liberty. It's the story of South Korean director Shin Sang-ok and his actress wife, a celebrity couple who were kidnapped by superfan Kim Jong-il and obliged to make films for his totalitarian northern state. Although it sticks closely to the known facts, there's a playful sense of mystery to ponder after the end credits roll: how much was Shin, broke and unemployable in his homeland, complicit in his own abduction?\n\nThe film's dramatic escape sequence had its echoes in another non-fiction hit, Gianfranco Rosi's buzz title Fire at Sea, an intimate, free-form study of Italy's immigrant crisis as seen from the perspective of Lampedusa's residents, which galvanised the festival.\n\nBy turns humorous and horrific, Rosi's emerged as the most powerful and relevant film of the Berlinale, where the fractious state of the world was clearly visible on the city's streets. The handful of bodyguards for jury head Meryl Streep initially seemed worryingly insubstantial until the day of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's state visit; the astonishing police presence then was a sobering reminder that the safety of movie stars wasn't exactly at the top of Angela Merkel's priorities.", "HASHTAG WOES: Natalie Bennett, guilty of the odd rogue H - but who can blame her?\n\nGREEN Party leader Natalie Bennett was in town on Monday, telling independent retailers she was against the \u00a3150 million Worcester Woods complex.\n\nBut the Aussie, who amusingly described yours truly as \"vaguely familiar\", may have more in common with Labour than any Green would prepare to admit.\n\nOn Twitter she proudly declared she was backing the '#no2worchesterwood' campaign - echoing Labour MP Chuka Umunna's famous balls-up in memorably calling Worcester 'Wichita' during a 2014 BBC interview.\n\nDoh!\n\n* BEWARE the Red Dragon was last week's key message from Labour's Richard Udall, who is sick of the Tories \"cosying up\" to Chinese delegates.\n\nBut before he takes his crusade against \"totalitarian\" tyrants too far, he might want to brush up on the forces behind Worcestershire's increasingly close links with China.\n\nTwo years ago a key delegation went on a crucial trade mission to see Chinese investors, paving the way for today's 'Sister City Agreement' with Hezhou.\n\nAmong those despatched to forge links with so-called despots?\n\nAdrian Gregson - Worcester City Council's ex-leader who runs the Labour group.\n\n* ONE politician caught up in Worcestershire's M5 chaos earlier this month was Councillor John Campion, who told the world about his seven hours stuck in gridlock blow-by-blow 'live' on social media.\n\nThe man trying to become new police and crime commissioner managed 12 tweets while stuck on the motorway - let's hope the engine was off and keys out, eh?\n\n* FORMER Mayor of Worcester David Tibbutt retired from the city council two years ago - but the doctor just can't stay away.\n\nThe ex-councillor has plastered leaflets all around Battenhall describing himself as the Conservative's 'Battenhall campaigner', which sounds suspiciously like an election pitch.\n\nAre we that close to May already?\n\n* YOU may have heard shops in Worcester face \u00a3100 fines for leaving rubbish bags outside all night, which will come as a relief to one councillor.\n\nRoger Knight, the city's Mayor, has told a wonderful tale of one Conservative who was ambling down The Shambles the other week and saw what can only be described as \"bin juice\" splattered across the floor.\n\nUpon stepping on extremely loose paving, the filthy fluid emanating from said rubbish bags then shot up his trouser leg.", "At the end of January, Germany's neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD) introduced a bill in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania's parliament to fine or throw in prison every foreigner who enters the state without the proper paperwork. The proposal was the latest in a long line of inflammatory proposals the NPD has put forth since it gained seats in the state's parliament in 2006. Like every other NPD proposal, it was voted down.\n\nEven though the sparsely-populated state is currently the only one in the country with NPD representatives in office, many German politicians see the party as more than a local nuisance. They believe that the NPD's presence in state parliament, however limited, threatens the country's democracy, tarnishes Germany's reputation abroad and gives the party a platform to propagate dangerous extremist views. It's why leaders of the 16 German states banded together two years ago to ban the NPD, even after their first effort failed in 2003.\n\nWhen Germany's Federal Constitutional Court finally hears the case against the NPD in early March, it will be the final stage in a dramatic, 15-year-long battle to outlaw the party, stripping it of its federal funding and political legitimacy. Now, however, with a decision drawing close, there is a chance that the ban could backfire and exacerbate the problem of simmering right-wing extremism.\n\nNPD and other far-right groups are gaining traction in Germany, thanks in part to their ability to attract people threatened by globalization and disenchanted with Germany's growing role on the world stage - from euro zone bailouts to an open-arms refugee policy. The NPD goes one step further, denying the Holocaust and espousing a racist ideology that contends people with Asian or African backgrounds could never be German.\n\nMore than a million asylum seekers arrived in Germany last year, prompting a sharp rise in attacks on refugee shelters and boosting support for groups that promote extreme German nationalism, including the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party - which competes with the NPD to attract far-right voters - and the anti-Islamic movement PEGIDA.\n\nGermany has historically snuffed out right-wing extremism using blunt legal tools - a hardline approach that makes it an exception among liberal democracies. Post war politicians believed that if the country had outlawed the Nazi party early enough, Germany could have prevented the rise of Adolf Hitler, and politicians took steps after the war to extinguish radical-right ideology. After a 70-year ban, a heavily annotated version of Hitler's manifesto, Mein Kampf, appeared on German bookshelves this year. In late January, Germany's interior minister banned a far-right Internet portal and German police arrested two people allegedly responsible for running it.\n\nEven in Germany, however, the bar to ban a political party is high for fear that the policy could be used to silence free speech and create a totalitarian regime the way that Hitler outlawed his political opponents. Since World War Two, Germany has only banned a political party twice, in 1952 and 1956. A party can only be banned when it is considered to be actively working against the state or threatening minority rights. Only the country's constitutional court can declare a party unconstitutional, and six of the court's eight judges have to agree. Even then, the NPD could appeal the ban to the European Court of Human Rights, contending it violates free speech rules.\n\nWhile the goal of the party ban is to stamp out extremist ideology, opponents worry it would mobilize right-wing extremists and push the issue underground. \"People think it's like taking out an appendix,\" said Anetta Kahane, chairwoman and founder of The Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which focuses on combating neo-Nazi and right-wing extremist activity in Germany. \"But it's false to believe that once it's gone everything is okay.\"\n\nKahane believes that right-wing ideology is entrenched in German society and that anxiety around multiculturalism and globalization will linger far beyond the current crisis. Rather than banning the party, she said that its supporters need to be educated and rooted out in organizations where they are active, such as schools, community groups and sports clubs.\n\nWorse, if the bid to ban the NPD fails, it could embolden the party, giving its members license to step up racist rhetoric. In 2004, the year after the previous bid to ban the NPD failed, the party won seats in Saxony's state parliament for the first time, which made it eligible for federal funding. The federal government had launched the bid trying to link the NPD to a surge in right-wing violence. The Federal Constitution Court rejected the NPD ban, based on tainted evidence. This time around, the federal government declined to join the suit.\n\nWhen the NPD got its start in the mid-1960s, West Germany was experiencing circumstances similar to today. After a decade of explosive growth, the economy was slowing to a more sustainable pace. Foreign guest workers were arriving from Italy, Turkey and elsewhere to help rebuild the country. In addition, West Germany was growing into a respected member of the international community, joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The party attracted voters who resented what they saw as a threat to German identity brought by foreign guest workers and American's influence on its culture.\n\nAfter a few years of electoral successes, the NPD largely moved to the fringes, until it re-emerged on the German political scene with its 2004 Saxony win. The party has since made inroads into the country's state governments, this time in the former East where unemployment soared after reunification. Bordering the Baltic Sea to the north and Poland to the east, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is the ideal breeding ground for the NPD's extremist thought. The state's unemployment rate, at 11.5 percent, is nearly double that of Germany overall.\n\nLorenz Caffier, the state's conservative Interior Minister, concedes that, on its own, banning the NPD won't end the problem of the extreme right in the country or even his state. After all, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party looks to be the NPD's biggest threat when Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and a handful of other states elect new parliaments later this year. But he believes that it would send an important signal to followers of the extreme right across Europe.\n\n\"No other country has a history like ours,\" said Caffier, who helped launch the current suit. \"Because of that, we have a responsibility to make sure that history is never again repeated on German soil.\"\n\nRenuka Rayasam is an Atlanta native, now based in Berlin.

The opinions expressed are her own.", "Apple's showdown with the FBI over access to an encrypted iPhone has been hailed by privacy advocates as a bold idealistic stand against the U.S. government's overbearing mass surveillance system.\n\nThat may be so, but it's also a calculated risk that benefits the company's bottom line, its reputation in respect to its Silicon Valley competition and the carefully crafted maverick image that Apple has spent years building.\n\nTo re-cap: On Tuesday, a judge ordered Apple to give the FBI a specially designed piece of software meant to bypass the encrypted security of an iPhone 5C used by one of the killers behind last December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.\n\nApple refused, arguing in a defiant statement from CEO Tim Cook that the move would set a \"dangerous precedent\" for government data collection and put the security of all iPhone users at risk. Cook dismissed the government's claim that the software would be only be usable on a single specified device as \"simply not true.\"\n\n\"The implications of the government's demands are chilling,\" he wrote.\n\nThe groundbreaking legal standoff, which some law experts and technologists have speculated could eventually reach as far the Supreme Court, is essentially the first real salvo in a long-simmering debate between Silicon Valley and Washington over what obligation tech companies are under to aid the government in monitoring for terrorist threats.\n\nApple has argued consistently that such access would intrude on user privacy and severely compromise security. By doing so -- often with remarks couched in lofty idealistic rhetoric -- Cook has built the promise of security and privacy further into Apple's brand and bolstered the \"Think Different\" ethos that the company has always used to set itself apart.\n\nIts defiance may have put it in the line of fire of U.S. politicians, government agencies and segments of the population who disagree, but it also gives off the crucial impression that Apple is putting its customers before all else.\n\nThat's especially important overseas, where Apple now conducts the majority of its business and where people might be even more wary about a government having access to the intimate details of their lives.\n\nNow that push is coming to shove, Apple has a huge business interest in following through with its fight.\n\n\"They can't be the brand they claim to be if they back down on this,\" said Susan Federspiel, strategy director at branding firm Landor. \"They're taking a principled stand right now and they're really gambling that this strong pro-privacy, pro-security stance will reinforce the trust that consumers have in the brand.\"\n\nOne of the reasons that Apple's brand is among the most successful in the world is that the company has always effectively imbued it with a distinct ideology.\n\nWhen Apple aired its now-famous \"1984\" commercial during the Super Bowl of the same year, it was more than just a head-turning way for an upstart computer company to make a national splash -- it was also a statement of purpose.\n\nApple was positioning itself as the counterculture underdog -- the rebellious woman with the hammer -- against then-dominant IBM, which it brashly cast as George Orwell's paragon of totalitarianism, Big Brother. The attitude was further reflected in Apple's populist tagline of the time, \"A computer for the rest of us.\"\n\nEven as it grew into the richest corporation in the world with luxury-brand products, Apple has tried to maintain that narrative whether its opponent is IBM, Microsoft or the federal government, as BrandBiz CEO and former Saatchi & Saatchi creative director Paul Friederichsen pointed out in a recent op-ed.\n\n\"It's always been fiercely independent,\" Friederichsen told Mashable. \"And it's important for the brand -- which can have even larger implications -- to maintain that kind of separation.\"\n\nBut Apple has also effectively become the \"Big Brother\" that it originally sought to depose; it dominates the smartphone market by a huge margin, routinely pulls in more cash than any company in the history of capitalism and teams with some of the most exclusive luxury brands.\n\nSo how does it still manage to claim the maverick image?\n\nThat narrative is now morphing into a fight much more aptly captured by that original commercial.\n\nAs consumers have grown more wary of tech companies logging away their personal details and governments monitoring communications, Apple has a distinct advantage over many of its Silicon Valley peers: Its business depends very little on advertising.\n\nUnlike advertising-heavy companies like Google and Facebook, it doesn't have as much use for your personal information, and it can keep its signature \"walled garden\" system wholly secure and mostly free from the interests of advertisers.\n\n\"They're probably saying, 'We have to be the protectors of our customers,\" said Forrester analyst Fatemeh Khatibloo. \"And to the extent that unlike Facebook and unlike Google, its users and customers are the same, they can really make that a competitive advantage.\"\n\nGoogle, Facebook and Twitter have all joined Apple in its stance this week, but Apple's size and the exceptional security and privacy standards that its ad-centric peers can't quite match have made it the clear leader in the fight for privacy and helps its \"think different\" brand live on.\n\nOf course, Apple's court battle doesn't come without major risks for the company. The company is likely facing down a protracted legal fight that could span months and drive unwanted media attention. Should it ultimately fail, it's likely to be detrimental to its business -- especially abroad, where Edward Snowden's bombshell revelations were said to have cost the company business contracts.\n\n\"They're playing a very high-stakes game of chicken,\" Friederichsen said.", "\"This will bring consequences,\" activist Marta Beatriz Roque told the Spain-based Diario de Cuba. \"These sorts of visits bring a lot of collateral damage.\"\n\nRoque explained her personal experiences with the Castro regime as a pro-democracy activist: \"I had to move from my house because I could not keep living in the same building as my aggressors, who broke my arm through punches.\" She added, \"It didn't stop them that I am a 70-year-old woman.\"\n\nRoque called President Obama \"blind ... if he has seen any advances in human rights\" since his announcement that the United States would pursue \"normalization\" with the communist regime.\n\nPresident Obama will be traveling to Cuba in late March before heading to Argentina. He is expected to meet with dictator Ra\u00fal Castro and \"other Cuban people.\" He is not expected to visit the troops stationed at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay Naval Base, which remains open despite a promise by candidate Obama that he would shut the base down immediately upon being elected.\n\nRoque's concern for collateral damage stems in part from the Cuban government's violent attacks on dissidents during Pope Francis' visit in September. More than 250 pro-democracy activists were arrested while Pope Francis was in Havana, including one arrested and beaten in front of Pope Francis' convoy for saying the word \"freedom\" near the Pope. Pope Francis denied having any knowledge of the event that happened before him.\n\nRoque is joined by a chorus of well-known activists who expressed dismay that President Obama would visit before Cuban officials showed any interest in free expression. Visiting \"in these conditions,\" said Cuban dissident leader Antonio Rodiles, \"is giving the Castro regime a pat on the back.\" Rodiles noted that politically motivated arrests \"are more violent now,\" and he sees nothing \"that indicates things are going in a good direction.\"\n\nGuillermo Fari\u00f1as, a Cuban dissident who won the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize after his 24th hunger strike against the Castro regime, called the visit, simply, \"an error.\" He said in the statement, \"It is an error to take this step towards the Cuban government without a public political commitment to shift the totalitarian Castro regime towards a state that respects rights.\"\n\nDanilo Maldonado, an artist known as El Sexto, has expressed a lack of confidence in any international activity improving the state of Cubans on the island. The only way to change Cuba, he tells independent outlet 14ymedio, \"is for the Cuban people to awaken internally.\" Maldonaldo blames Cuban artists for \"this system getting this far,\" claiming many artists have worked on behalf of the regime out of fear.

They include Presidential National Security Office Chief Kim Kwan-jin, Unification Minister Hong Yong-pyo, Defense Minister Han Min-koo and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.\n\nCheong Wa Dae said Friday that its National Security Council (NSC) is rigorously managing scenarios related to terrorist attacks.\n\n\"The NSC is thoroughly in control of every situation related to terrorism,\" said presidential spokesman Jung Youn-kuk.\n\nBut Jung refused to comment on whether high-ranking government officials are the target of the North's terrorism plans.\n\nThe warning comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula over the totalitarian state's Jan. 6 nuclear test and Feb. 7 long-range rocket launch.\n\nAlso on Friday, Rep.

Security Council (UNSC) that contains stronger and more effective sanctions against the isolated state.\n\n\"There is a great possibility that a stronger resolution will be adopted this time,\" the official said, refusing to elaborate further on details of possible sanctions.\n\nHe noted that South Korea and the U.S. will discuss unilateral measures, in addition to the U.N. sanctions, after watching the results of the UNSC discussion.\n\nDuring separate phone conversations with President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Feb. 9, President Park Geun-hye agreed with them on the need for unilateral measures in addition to the U.N. sanctions.\n\nIt has been more than a month since the North's nuclear test in January, but the UNSC has yet to come up with a new sanctions resolution, apparently because China, North Korea's closest ally, has been reluctant to impose harsher measures on Pyongyang.\n\nBeijing's cooperation is essential to implement a meaningful sanctions resolution, as it is one of five veto-holding permanent members of the UNSC and the main provider of food and fuel aid to the impoverished North.\n\nBut the official made it clear that making a decision on whether to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to the peninsula is Seoul's sovereign right, referring to objections regarding the issue voiced by China.\n\n\"The decision will be made in accordance with national security and interests,\" he said. \"No other conditions are linked to this.\"\n\nThe remark was construed as downplaying speculation that Seoul and Washington provoked the THAAD issue to pressure China to join hands with them on producing harsher sanctions against Pyongyang, if Beijing does not want a THAAD battery to be placed on Korean soil.\n\n\"I haven't heard that the THAAD issue is linked with Beijing's participation in the UNSC discussion for sanctions,\" he said.\n\nChina has been opposed to the THAAD deployment on the peninsula out of concerns that its radar could snoop on the country's military activities.\n\nFollow Jun Ji-hye on Twitter @TheKopJihye", "HASHTAG WOES: Natalie Bennett, guilty of the odd rogue H -

However, in 2010 the Government signed the Cochabamba Declaration, which categorically condemns the growing of these kinds of crops.\n\nBut the signing of this declaration has not prevented the Government itself from promoting the production of transgenic organisms. It does so through the Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, working on the production of various transgenic organisms: corn, soybeans, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, potatoes, rice and claria.\n\nThe absence of environmental activism, given the control over associations and independent initiatives in Cuba's totalitarian society, further hamper protest and opposition to this trend.\n\nAnd the national press rarely uses the word \"transgenic\" in information related to these types of crop.\n\nAs an example, the study refers to a report presented in December 2014 at the National Assembly of People's Power by the Cuban Interior Ministry's Agricultural Business Group (a military unit).\n\nIn the document, the company says it aims to bolster \"the indispensable relationship between the Agricultural Business Groups and research centres to apply the latest agro-technological advances.\" The authors of the People in Need report state that this is a euphemism to avoid any use of the word \"transgenic.\"\n\nThe report also indicates that the Cuban authorities have failed to conclusively demonstrate the safety of GMOs with regards to human health and the environment under the specific conditions of each site.\n\nIn fact, such evidence does not exist in Cuba, which \"approved, in record time, the release of FR-BT1 transgenic corn, disregarding the recommendations of experts and the request for a moratorium on the process.\"\n\nThe study indicates that these \"anti-environmental\" practices entail the recovery of a conventional agricultural model defined by high yields, great dependence on external decisions, and in which the grower is deprived of autonomy.\n\n\"GMO-based agriculture, in addition to not guaranteeing truly higher yields, leads to the deterioration and loss of agricultural biodiversity, and favours the privatisation of and control over seeds,\" says the report.\n\nThe door is opened to transgenics\n\nThis would be an \"imminent danger, with the presumed entry of American agriculture into the island's productive dynamics.\"\n\nThe report points out that approximately 70% of processed foods in the US contain transgenic products, mainly corn, soybeans, cotton, sugar beet, rapeseed, and growth hormones for livestock.\n\nDue to their saturation of the market, and strong opposition to their agricultural products in Europe, US seed and agribusiness firms have turned their sights on China and Latin America.\n\nThe main players at the international level are Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical, as well as Germany's Bayer, and Switzerland's Syngenta (both already in Cuba). Many of these large companies have formed the US Agriculture Coalition for Cuba (USACC) for the alleged purpose of achieving an end to the embargo.\"\n\nAccording to Greenpeace GMOs form part of an industrial agriculture model that is destructive because it demands large amounts of water and oil.\n\nIt is also associated with the deforestation of ecosystems; applies chemical products (fertilisers and pesticides) that release greenhouse gases, like N20 (nitrous oxide), which is the largest agricultural contribution to climate change; harms small farmers and producers; and places the control of agriculture in fewer hands.\n\nThe organisation notes that GMOs are new kinds of living beings that have never existed in nature before, created in the laboratory by manipulating genes. More and more scientific data substantiate the risks they pose to human health and the environment.", "The way we learn most about presidential candidates now is through debates, which are to real governance as Home Run Derby is to real baseball. So be it. Who can avoid brain freezes? Who can strike out in one game and go 4-for-4 in the next? These next two months will tell.\n\nWe can already lay to rest, though, the silly debate of the early primary season: Does a senator or a governor make the best president? It's silly because a president needs to understand both big and little, both vision and the devilish details. The capacity to comprehend both varies enormously from individual to individual, regardless of experience.\n\nThe more important question is worldview -- and in this election, how a candidate views the world. We've elected each of our last three presidents (two governors, one senator) as domestic policy chiefs. Bill Clinton ran immediately after the Cold War ended. George W. Bush sadly became a foreign policy president after 9/11: His play in an uncompassionate arena allowed Barack Obama to gain the White House with a 2008 pledge to bring troops home and ignore as much as possible the rest of the world. (Bow, \"reset,\" smile.)\n\nGiven this history, it's irrelevant whether governor or senator DNA is better. The candidates need Cuban DNA, the kind gained from seeing totalitarianism face to face and understanding its soul-sapping evil. In Havana and Miami I've interviewed Cuban Christians who learned crucial lessons by spending years in Fidel Castro's prisons, but you don't need Cuban genes to have the kind of Cuban DNA I'm describing. It comes whenever you learn to fight dictators. We were blessed in the United States to have a run of presidents with Cuban DNA: Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, then John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon.\n\nWith all their differences in policy and character, they were all ready, in Kennedy's classic words, to \"pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" They all acted in support of other parts of Kennedy's inaugural address: that \"the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\" That the United States should not \"permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed.\"\n\nJimmy Carter did not understand that and lost to Ronald Reagan, who had Cuban DNA after battling Communist influence in Hollywood and staring down threats to throw acid in his face. Many Americans were tired of hardships, and had Reagan not gained the support of Democrats disgusted by abortion, Carter could have been reelected. Soviet leaders would have carried on. The Cold War would have continued. We might now all be dead after miscommunication and fear led to nuclear war.\n\nBut we survived, and a generation arose that did not know Josef Stalin or Mao Zedong or Pol Pot or the Ayatollah Khomeini. Unwilling to bear burdens, and listening to the pied piping of a president who thinks the problem is too much American power, moviegoers cheer rebels like Katniss in The Hunger Games, but in life most are rebels without a cause. One reason is that we live now in a new book of Judges, where arbiters of legal right and wrong declare there is no God in America and everyone should do what is right in his own eyes.\n\nWhile America falls into cultural anarchy, dictators who mix nationalism with remnants of communism rule Russia and China, and Middle Eastern clerics worship a god created in man's authoritarian imagination. The antidote to both anarchy and oligarchy is Cuban DNA. The only good that came out of my youthful Communism was an appreciation of the reality of evil. Some ISIS-watchers are gaining a similar education. Many millennials lack that understanding, but there's still time. Maybe their teachers can be the two senators in our presidential race with Cuban DNA bequeathed them by their fathers, who saw Fidel Castro and ultimately refused to bow, scrape, and grin. I find both to be attractive candidates, but others may also have it: We'll learn much during debates to come.", "Now that R\u00e9publique is on PS4, players can finally take full control of Hope, a young woman held captive inside Metamorphosis, a shadowy totalitarian state ruled by the omnipresent Overseer.

After years of being ranked by Skytrax as the world's worst airline, national carrier Air Koryo is undergoing a revolution, according to interviews with passengers and travel agents.\n\nNew planes, new in-flight entertainment options, smart new uniforms for the cabin attendants, even business class. It's all part of supreme leader Kim Jong Un's effort to boost tourist numbers 20-fold to 2 million by 2020 and supplement the nation's meagre foreign exchange.\n\nHere are five reasons to book your ticket now, before the thrill of flying the world's only one-star airline vanishes forever. (And as long as you don't mind helping fund Kim's nuclear-weapons programme.)\n\nTHE HERMIT KINGDOM\n\nBesides the joy of experiencing Air Koryo, the main draw for most travellers is to have a peek inside the world's most isolated country. As Singaporean Mindy Tan put it after visiting last year: \"I'm sick of all the same footage of marching, pictures of Kim. I just had to witness it for myself.''\n\nDon't worry about the odd nuclear test or missile launch, here you can run a marathon down Pyongyang's totalitarian streets or watch 100,000 kids doing synchronised dancing. The country is trying to open up attractions like the Masikryong Ski Resort and the Lake Taesong golf club. And where else can you still get stopped from taking a selfie in the wrong place?\n\nTHE IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nThe communal screens that drop down from the ceiling will keep you entertained with propaganda broadcasts and concerts by supreme leader Kim Jong Un's favourite all-female band, Moranbong, who sing patriotic songs about, well, Kim Jong Un. Bring noise-cancelling earphones. There's no volume control.\n\nTHE PLANES\n\nYou don't often get tour agents who will arrange a trip to a country just to fly in its planes, but in North Korea this is possible. London-based Juche Travel Services offers an aviation-themed tour. Air Koryo recently acquired two Russian-built Tupolev Tu-204s for international routes, with an economy ticket costing about 900 yuan ($137) for the two-hour journey from Beijing. Once in Pyongyang, you can hop into Soviet-era aircraft such as a Mil Mi-17 transport helicopter for a buzz over the capital, or a view of the mountains.", "The social phenomenon of violent acts of terrorism has an intellectual and behavioural context that needs to be objectively and analysed without prejudice. Many would argue that the way to counter acts of terrorism is to address the supposed grievances that arise from deprivation of civil rights, human rights and democracy.\n\nThen is the deliberate targeting of civilians, to indiscriminately murder and maim innocent children, women and men, not the deprivation of such rights? If it were not, then national and international conflicts and struggles for civil rights, human rights and democracy by using violence may be justified by extremist and terror groups. This mindset is most dangerous.\n\nMahatma Gandhi's struggle for a free India and Martin Luther King Jr's campaign for equal rights for all Americans strongly denounced all forms of hatred and oppression especially violence.\n\nBesides military strategies to counter violence by communist insurgents, Gerald Templer most notably succeeded in the nationwide campaign against these insurgents by \"winning the hearts and minds of the people\" especially the supporters during the emergency era in Malaysia.\n\nPerhaps due to the lack of intellectual and objective reasoning by terror groups, thus, the only known strategy to gain support for its irrational cause is by utilising violence and imposing extreme fear on children, men and women.\n\nPut simply, that's why they are terrorists and not champions of social order and justice. Champions of civil and human rights are proponents in the sanctity of each human life, are committed to the ideals of liberty, and the values of democracy.\n\nTerrorists do not respect the basic rights all fellow humans. In fact, they believe in the very opposite. Unfortunately, terror groups use religion as an anchor to champion its cause. They legitimise their unthinkable acts of violence in the name of religion and God.\n\nThey operate on the principle of destroying anything that fall on their chosen path and their biggest obstruction is innocent civilians regardless of colour, creed or religion. They blatantly discard all moral code, social norms and values established since early civilisation. Not only do they rampantly and indiscriminately kill fellow humans but if possible, eliminate cultures that have existed for centuries.\n\nIn their perspective, they are saviours and their doctrine totalitarianism. Maybe the doctrine of totalitarianism justifies the root causes of terrorism. They want to decide what is right and wrong, good and bad for all mankind. They don't want people who think, who questions, who criticises and who analyses.\n\nTotalitarian governments will systemically brainwash its subjects. The will never allow the moral consciousness of people to exist or prevail. They will suppress and oppress all rational thinking processes and actions. Individuals will cease to exist. The concept of civil societies will be buried.\n\nThose who identify themselves with terror groups and participate in terror acts will rule as terrorists. They will never protect freedom, liberty and human rights. Tyranny without any doubt will prevail through dictatorship when a terrorist group become the ruling government. Only in totalitarian governments under tyranny rule can the culture of terrorism flourish and expand.\n\nPluralism must be respected\n\nDemocratic nations must courageously take measures to eliminate all forms terrorism. We act for the sake of humanity, freedom and democratic rights. Pluralism must be respected. We must not allow terrorism to breed in our sovereign nations. Terrorism will never be able to flourish in nations where civil rights, human rights and democracy are strongly grounded and protected by the people and the government.\n\nThe respect and dignity for fellow humans must be constantly observed and practised. Thus, we must without fear condemn all form of terrorist acts especially when such acts are carried out in the name of religion and God. We live freely and we die freely and this must remain constant.\n\nP SUNDRAMOORTHY is a member of the Research Team on Crime & Policing, School of Social Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.", "Change is in the air in North Korea. After years of being ranked by Skytrax as the world's worst airline, national carrier Air Koryo is undergoing a revolution, according to interviews with passengers and travel agents.\n\nNew planes, new in-flight entertainment options, smart new uniforms for the cabin attendants, even business class. It's all part of supreme leader Kim Jong Un's effort to boost tourist numbers 20-fold to 2 million by 2020 and supplement the nation's meager foreign exchange.\n\nHere are five reasons to book your ticket now, before the thrill of flying the world's only one-star airline vanishes forever. (And as long as you don't mind helping fund Kim's nuclear-weapons program.)\n\nThe Hermit Kingdom\n\nBesides the joy of experiencing Air Koryo, the main draw for most travelers is to have a peek inside the world's most isolated country. As Singaporean Mindy Tan put it after visiting last year: \"I'm sick of all the same footage of marching, pictures of Kim. I just had to witness it for myself.''\n\nDon't worry about the odd nuclear test or missile launch, here you can run a marathon down Pyongyang's totalitarian streets or watch 100,000 kids doing synchronized dancing. The country is trying to open up attractions like the Masikryong Ski Resort and the Lake Taesong golf club. And where else can you still get stopped from taking a selfie in the wrong place?\n\nThe in-flight entertainment\n\nThe communal screens that drop down from the ceiling will keep you entertained with propaganda broadcasts and concerts by supreme leader Kim Jong Un's favorite all-female band, Moranbong, who sing patriotic songs about, well, Kim Jong Un. Bring noise-cancelling earphones. There's no volume control.\n\nThe planes\n\nYou don't often get tour agents who will arrange a trip to a country just to fly in its planes, but in North Korea this is possible. London-based Juche Travel Services offers an aviation-themed tour. Air Koryo recently acquired two Russian-built Tupolev Tu-204s for international routes, with an economy ticket costing about 900 yuan ($137) for the two-hour journey from Beijing. Once in Pyongyang, you can hop into Soviet-era aircraft such as a Mil Mi-17 transport helicopter for a buzz over the capital, or a view of the mountains.\n\n\"It's a very different experience, traveling back 20, 30 years,'' says Sam Chui, an aviation enthusiast who's flown Air Koryo about 20 times.\n\nAirport queues\n\nWhile you may suffer the inconvenience of long queues and immigration hassles at your point of departure on your way to North Korea, once you arrive in the Democratic People's Republic, it should be a breeze.\n\nNo longer do you have to shuffle through the strange temporary shed that has been masquerading as an airport terminal for the past five years, now the capital has a sleek, brand-new building. And with fewer than half a dozen international flights a day, and little chance of delays due to strikes, the airport bus may deliver you on time to an almost deserted building.\n\nThe burger\n\nWhile the food, especially in the new business-class lounge, has improved, the most-photographed component of an Air Koryo trip remains the famous \"mystery-meat\" burger.\n\n\"The burger has been going on for so many years, everyone's making fun of it,\" says Chui, who has eaten at least 10 of them. To put to rest the long-running dispute over the source of the protein, we contacted Air Koryo's office in Beijing for clarification. The airline's representatives didn't respond.\n\nBefore it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.", "Are you a feminist? When the New York Times recently posed this question in a front-page news story some young women professed bafflement as to what that even meant. Such confusion in turn causes older women to lament a generation unappreciative of its hard-won gender battles and, as we've learned this election season, to endow a pitchfork in hell for each of these insolent young apostates.\n\nBut these young women are right. We need to recognize the paltry limits of the word instead of blaming them for rejecting it.\n\nI've been asking what it means to be a feminist since the 1980s, attempting to first articulate these thoughts in a story I wrote for the Village Voice, where I worked back then. The question felt urgent because the college professor who helped shape my feminist thinking had become a pariah among liberal feminists. Because I was a young liberal feminist fresh out of the university their response left me struggling to define what it meant to be part of this social movement.\n\nMy professor was a political scientist who urged me to read all the nonfiction feminist writing of English novelist Virginia Woolf. The professor talked about her own difficulties rising through the ranks of academia (\"we don't hire women,\" she initially was told). When she mentioned to her mentor, an eminent political scientist, the book she planned to write about women in government, he responded, \"But Jeane, you don't have a subject there.\" I listened attentively, longing for the buoyant canopy of intellectual confidence she possessed that navigated each of these leaps for equality into a steady landing.\n\nJeane (who didn't have a subject there) was Jeane Kirkpatrick. Her name probably means little to today's socially engaged young women, but before Samantha Power and Susan Rice, Kirkpatrick was the first woman to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations and the first woman foreign policy cabinet member.\n\nExcept the president was Ronald Reagan. Kirkpatrick, a Democrat when I knew her who told me she planned to support Teddy Kennedy for president, had become a foreign policy hawk and subsequently was plucked by Reagan for this post. Her conservative political philosophy outraged feminists, and although Kirkpatrick became one of the most powerful women in American history, the editors of the Handbook of American Women's History intentionally excluded her from this reference book.\n\nI shared their outrage about Kirkpatrick's foreign policy views (she famously argued that totalitarian regimes were always intolerable, but it was in America's interest to support \"friendly\" authoritarian ones). But does feminism mean that we (whoever the self-determined \"we\" are) get to handpick our feminists and deny Kirkpatrick the label that she used to define herself?\n\nVirginia Woolf had the prescience in the 1930s to recognize that the problem may lie in the word. She argued that after women's right to earn a living had been won, the word \"feminist\" should be thrown out of the language if its only meaning is \"one who champions the rights of women.\" Within the meager limits of this definition, \"a dead word, a corrupt word\" exists. If the word is destroyed, wrote Woolf, in the cleansed air we could see the task ahead: \"Men and women working together for the same cause.\" (Woolf's cause was fighting fascist tyranny.)\n\nIt may be impossible to find an all-inclusive definition for feminism because a woman's struggle to find a place in the world is rooted in, and reflected by, the prism of her own experience. Contemporary American feminism has primarily come to mean championing women's autonomy and challenging the privileging of male over female. But a feminism that is chiefly about autonomy is bound to liberate one person at the expense of another - as witnessed in women's victory to secure the right to earn a living. The professional mother too often is \"liberated\" by the nanny who scrambles to find care for her own children.\n\nMany college women also can't relate to feminism because the autonomy they experience during their time on campus is unique and irreplaceable. But these young women may confront boundaries later, especially if they choose to become mothers. Nothing cleans all the wonder and mess of personal freedom like a diaper wipe.\n\nContemporary feminism carries with it a troubled legacy of affirming equality without reconciling the reality of dependency - one that has contributed to our country's shameful lack of family policies. The challenges inevitably arise when nurturing and raising another human being. That's where the tenets of mainstream feminism, based on the Enlightenment values of equality, autonomy, and self-determination, have always seemed inadequate.\n\nMen and women need to work together toward the same cause -- a society in which every member has the opportunity to flourish. Meanwhile, let's not get stuck on the word feminism - or at least recognize that its paradigm-shifting radiance dims when pitting one woman's fulfillment against another's."], "2016-02-22": ["The 1991 Gulf War saw only 100 hours of ground fighting as U.S. forces entered Kuwait to end the Iraqi occupation, but echoes of that conflict have lingered for decades in the Middle East.The war pushed America into opening military bases in the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, drawing the anger of an upstart militant named Osama bin Laden and laying the groundwork for al-Qaida attacks leading up to Sept. 11, 2001. Saddam Hussein, demonized as being worse than Adolf Hitler by President George H.W. Bush, would outlast his American rival in power until Bush's son launched the 2003 American-led invasion that toppled the Iraqi dictator.Now, 25 years after the first U.S. Marines swept across the border into Kuwait, American forces are battling the extremist Islamic State group, born out of al-Qaida, in the splintered territories of Iraq and Syria. The Arab allies that joined the 1991 coalition are fighting their own conflicts at home and abroad, as Iran vies for greater regional power following a nuclear deal with world powers.Iraq itself is now fragmented and war-torn to a degree few could have imagined after that 1991 U.S. victory. The IS jihadis have imposed their rule over many of the Sunni-dominated areas of the country, Kurds in the north have their own virtual mini-state and Shiites -- many of them allied to Iran -- lead the government in Baghdad.In all, the United States finds itself in the quandary it hoped to avoid back in 1991.\"Had we taken all of Iraq, we would have been like the dinosaur in the tar pit -- we would still be there, and we, not the United Nations, would be bearing the costs for that occupation,\" the late U.S. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Desert Storm, wrote in his memoirs.Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, angry that the tiny neighbor and the United Arab Emirates had ignored OPEC quotas, which Saddam claimed cost his nation $14 billion. Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping crude from a disputed oil field and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion of debt that Iraq had accumulated during its 1980s war with Iran.Fearing Saudi Arabia could be invaded next, U.S. officials moved quickly to deploy troops to the region. After months of negotiations and warnings, the U.S. launched its assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait on Feb. 24, 1991.In purely military and political terms, the first Gulf War marked a tremendous success for a U.S. still haunted by Vietnam. America suffered 148 combat deaths during the entire conflict, while 467 troops were wounded out of more than 500,000 deployed, according to the Defense Department. The U.S. held together an allied army, its war effort was supported by a number of United Nations resolutions, and the conflict cemented its position as the sole world power following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. America's Arab allies also footed much of the bill for the $61 billion war, with both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait contributing some $16 billion, while the United Arab Emirates offered $4 billion, according to U.S. congressional reports. Japan and Germany together contributed another $16 billion, while South Korea gave $251 million. The U.S. covered the rest.The key players in the Arab world at the time of the conflict are now long gone.Saudi King Fahd died in 2005. A popular uprising toppled Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Syria's totalitarian ruler Hafez Assad, a longtime U.S. foe who joined the Gulf War effort to reap billions in aid and diplomatic benefits, died in 2000. His son, President Bashar Assad, still clings to power amid a five-year civil war that has killed more than 250,000 people and flooded Europe with tens of thousands fleeing violence across the region.In Israel, the memory of Iraqi Scud missile-fire prompted the military to speed up a missile-defense program that included the development of its Iron Dome rocket-defense system with the help of the Americans. Then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, a hard-liner, held back from retaliating at the request of Bush, who feared losing Arab support for the war. Though American aid to Israel exceeds $3 billion a year, relations have been strained over stalled Palestinian peace talks.Yet despite seeing his forces routed from Kuwait, Saddam clung to power and survived an uprising by both Shiites and Kurds following the war. The U.S. and its allies began to patrol a northern and southern no-fly zone to protect the Shiites and the Kurds while Saddam remained a thorn in the side of American politics for more than a decade.\"I miscalculated,\" Bush said in a December 1995 interview. \"I thought he'd be gone.\"It would take President George W. Bush's 2003 invasion to end Saddam's reign, coming amid the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan. In its aftermath, al-Qaida in Iraq would arise and be put down by a U.S. military surge, coupled with the support of Sunni tribesmen. But as the U.S. withdrew from Iraq and Baghdad stopped supporting the Sunni tribesmen, the Islamic State group emerged from the ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq and in 2014, took control of about a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria.Today, the U.S. finds itself mired in a long war feared by Schwarzkopf and others who oversaw Operation Desert Storm. Oil prices, which sparked Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, have dropped to under $30 a barrel from more than $100 in just a year and a half.The cause, in part, is the same OPEC overproduction the late dictator Saddam railed against across the splintered Middle East.", "Stanford, California - In his new book on George Orwell, Stanford English Professor Alex Woloch writes that Orwell's anti-totalitarianism can only be understood in relation to his democratic-socialist political beliefs.\n\nAnd much of this is revealed in how Orwell used language, according to Woloch, a scholar of 19th- and 20th-century fiction and literary theory and the chair of the Stanford Department of English. For his book Or Orwell: Writing and Democratic Socialism, Woloch studied Orwell's essays, journalism and documentary writing, especially a series of columns that the British writer penned for the socialist weekly Tribune. Titled \"As I Please,\" those columns represent a part of Orwell's writing that scholars have never examined so closely before.\n\nIn doing so, Woloch seeks to understand Orwell's often hard-to-pin-down political views while highlighting the \"very complicated texts he crafted to express his political opinions.\" If \"we all have a responsibility to make political judgments,\" Orwell's work \"illustrates how deeply such judgments can be informed by the craft and constraints of writing.\"\n\nPolitical thinking, in this light, can draw on the same resources as literary writing: irony, experiment, variety and imaginative precision, he said.\n\nPerhaps by reading Orwell more carefully, and paying attention to his formal and linguistic subtlety, Woloch suggests, society today can create a more humane political culture.\n\nBeyond 1984\n\nTo those readers familiar only with Animal Farm and 1984, Orwell is one of the greatest anti-communist and anti-totalitarian writers of the 20th century, Woloch noted. To others, he is an avatar of plainspoken common sense.\n\nBut Woloch rises above this stereotypical image of Orwell as \"a naturally virtuous person,\" by examining the author's writing and reconciling Orwell's ethics and political vision.\n\nFor example, Woloch said, Orwell's 1946 essay \"Why I Write\" reflects his primary political orientation. In it, Orwell famously stated: \"Every line of serious work I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.\"\n\nWoloch believes that each of the two halves of this statement must be given equal weight, and that we cannot understand Orwell's anti-totalitarianism if we do not consider it in relation to his democratic-socialist thought.\n\nHowever, a key Cold War introduction to Animal Farm in the United States simply omitted the last phrase - \"for democratic socialism, as I understand it\" - leaving only what Orwell was \"against.\" The absence of the phrase serves as a metaphor in Woloch's book for Orwell's own persistent engagement with the elusiveness and complexity of language, writing and form.\n\nBetween theory and politics\n\nWoloch became interested in Orwell in part through his own political commitments and his sense that Orwell's work speaks to contemporary political concerns. He finds it suggestive, and a little amusing, that the first serious U.S. presidential candidacy of a self-identified democratic socialist (Bernie Sanders) should occur just as his book is being published.\n\nAt the same time, the book is motivated by a set of scholarly and theoretical concerns. Much of English literary criticism in the last three decades has been dominated by different strands of deconstructive theory, which, as Woloch puts it, \"can find political ideology in almost any writing.\" In other words, deconstructive theory looks for the subliminal political ramifications of literature.\n\nWhile this approach has been fruitful in interpreting any number of written works, it falls short when confronted with an author like Orwell. That is because Orwell's political commitments are clear to even the most na\u00efve reader, Woloch said. He noted, \"Theory doesn't always know what to do with a writer like Orwell.\"\n\nWoloch uses close reading and theory to get underneath the skin of Orwell's prose, not to reveal hidden political opinions, but rather to show how Orwell's language informs and makes possible those views.\n\nThis new turn is in part made possible by the first complete works of Orwell, published in the 1990s. The complete works, which included his prolific journalism alongside his more well-known novels and essays, made clear to scholars just how important something like the weekly \"As I Please\" column could be to understanding the writer.\n\n\"We want a figure like Orwell, we want that voice to comment on [the terrorist attacks in] Paris or to comment on [Donald] Trump. But my book is about the complexity of bearing witness. It's about the complex forms of writing that a writer like Orwell would want to enable and foster,\" Woloch said.", "With any single further step of \"messing-up\" nothing shall stop it from reaching a point of \"no-return\". From there it will more bloodier, far reaching and of an untold devasting consequencies. This is so evidential. The wild and expansive wave of Islamists political radicalism encircling in a dramatic speed the African continent is putting the entire arrangement of continental \"identity politics\" into a real \"existential threat\".\n\nConsidering the impact is generating, the ongoing challenge will have an unprecedented deeper implications on African \"identity politics\" that could possibly go beyond the combined impact visited on the continent by different intruders before including that of the Greeks and the Romans in ancient times, of the Arabo-IslamIsts in the mediveal era and the European colonizers of the modern time. Some political observers ascertain to the extent that, the \"emanating hazard is threatening to change the entire continental political metabolism\".\n\nWhat makes the whole prediction more conceivable and prophetic is the reality that this battle has been \"down played\" by those who matters. Thus its consequences are inadequately recognized as its poorly understood by continental political elites, respective government leaders, security advisors, intelligence pundits, academics and conflict resolution experts. As they all are \"distracted\" by the immediate security threat of terrorism, they failed to appreciate the other more subtle aspect and dimension of the danger. Thereafter this strategic field of confrontation left 'unguarded' and hence escaped 'unnoticed'.\n\nPHASE-IN AND PHASE-OUT:\n\nOperating on the bases of tactical, operational and strategic phases, these radical Islamists aim to destabilize the existing schematic setup of Africa's \"political-identity\" and in the immediate process impose religious element as a defining factor that shapes the base of that set-up. Belittling, demeaning and devaluing the relevancy and importance of the other multiple factors, their schematic thinking process is designed to ascertain demographic engineering, racial alteration and annihilation of Africa's indigenous cultures. Intimidation and coercive means are among other heavy-handed measures thoroughly applied.\n\nINCOMPATIBLE AND CONTRADICTIVE VIEWS\n\nSimilar to Samuel Huntigton's theory of \"Clash of Civilizations\" the two political bases (that of Islamists and indigenous African) are of total contradictive nature. Unlike the Islamists values on governance and their worldview which are based on 'religion as a single determining factor of identity, African mode of 'political-identity' is based on tangible factors such as ethnicity, gender, region, poverty, freedom, cultural diversity, peace, democracy and the challenges these issues cause. Thus, while addressing grievances that usuallt emanate from such issues dictate \"rational thinking\" that requires mutual recognition, dialogue, negotiations and tolerance as means in order to reach harmony, peaceful co-existence, justice, equality, proportional representation, social welfare as objectives. While the Islamists totalitarianism on the other hand conditions religious allegiance, linguistic divinity, gender superiority, ethnic segregation, racial preferences and even genocide as the case may needs.\n\nIT IS AN ACT OF VANDALISM PREVAILING ALL A LONG:\n\nIn the context of Africa's complex, multiplistic and \"colorful\" reality, to apply this fundamentalist parochial unitary theocratic approach, the Islamists are ready to go far to the extent modifying and forging the \"DNA\" of African identity all together. Today Sudan's case (which is falling apart) stands as a living testimony. The burning of the ancient library of AL-Alexandria (Egypt), the recent destruction of Timbuktu's mausoleum in Mali, what signifies the name \"Boko Haram\" (which literally means \"Western Education is forbidden\") and the dilemma and predicament facing North Africa with its culture condemned and impaired, its history forged and its civilization vandalized and torn apart (like the actbof intentional flooding of Nubian heritage by way building dams) are all historical evidence that reinforce these forecasts. Yet, not surprisingly but on the contrary this legacy of destruction provides the Islamists with more moral energy, inspiration and spiritual stimulation to further launch more heinous attacks.\n\nWHEN MOSQUES ARE MORE THAN LECTURE ROOMS!!\n\nAccording to statement attributed to Mr. Issoufou Yahaya (a historian from Niger) that today, in his native country Niger \"there are more mosques than lecture rooms\". This is in comparison to a situation where, in Niger, in 1980s, while he was student at University of Niamey \"there was not a single mosque in the campus\" as he testifies.\n\nEVEN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS ARE CAUGHT UP IN MAYHEM.\n\nMr. Yahaya's remarks tally with the findings provided by Professor Sultan Barakat (of the Brookings Doha Centre in Qatar), who notes that \"African Higher education system have become casualties of war, caught up in the cross-fire of Islamic Fundamentalism that cut across the spectrum of religious and political thought\". He further adds that \"tragically higher education in Africa is now caught in mayhem that emanated from the Middle East and from local radical groups that exploit Islam for political and social ends\".\n\nProfessor Alexander De Wall of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy also notes that \"while Christian students have been using non-violent means to alter their status, their Muslim counter parts have been joining the ranks of radical Islamists that mix liberation politics with religious revival\".\n\nISLAMIST RADICALS ARE DICTATING \"AGENDA SETTING\" OF INTELLECTUAL DEBATE\n\nDr. Sansom Milton, a research fellow at the post-war Reconstruction Unit of the University of York (UK), observes that \"in several universities in North Africa, narrow religious considerations often taken centre stage. For instances in some universities, debate such as democracy, the fight against corruption, women rights have been replaced by linear issues such as \"whether to ban or not to ban headscarves for female students\".\n\nIn this regards where African Universities swept up in Islamic extremism, Mr. Wachiri Kithoto makes a challenging note: \"The African governments appear to have limited options to decide whether university students should be trained for nation building or become foot soldiers for extremist religion interventions\".\n\nENCROACHING DEEPER INTI AFRICA'S POLITICAL FABRIC\n\nWhile all brands of Islamic radical groups have presence in African continent, and openly identifying and declaring their allegiance or membership to either Al-gaeda or ISIS, the Boko Haram, the Al-Shabab, Ansar Adin, AQIM are waging Jihad, controlling territories, killing, kidnapping, raping, and openly preaching their \"apophathic\" views about establishing \"Caliphate system\" in Africa, many in the continent (as referred above) have their doubts (which are totally unjustified) about the magnitude and scale of the danger these Islamist kept posing on almost daily bases. Yet from all the indications available they are surely dead wrong. The \"matter\" is real.\n\nHowever, what is of more significant is that the possibilty of presence of these fundamentalist elements in even more more \"softer\" and \"strategic\" quarters cannot be ruled out. Professor Ofu Okeke of the University of KwaZulu Natal (SA) ascertains this. He argue that organization like Boko Haram (which operating simultanously in three or more countries) has membership that cut across a broad spectrum and extends to former university lectures, bankers, graduates and undergraduates and political elites. What this could also mean is that, nothing prevents these elements to attract more invisible supporters, sympathizers, more facilitators, potential collaborators and 'fortune-seekers' in \"high places\" and \"sensitive positions\".\n\nDr. HASSAN AL-TURABI'S VERDICTS\n\nNot surprisingly, Professor Okeke's accounts go in conformity with what Dr. Hassan Al-Turabi (the leading ideologue of political Islam in Africa) states. Dr. Al-Turabi explains that \"the Islam that is spreading through African societies is the new active Islam and not dormant one\". For him that type of Islam is \"going into politics, economics, culture, education and the entire public life\". Certainly the operative words here are \"it's going into politics and culture\".That is what this piece intends to bring into attention.\n\nAFRICAN MUSLIM BELT IS TIGHTENED\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Mr. Yaroslav Tromifov is more prompt and emphatic when it comes in addressing this issue. Under \"Africa's Muslim Belt is Getting Bloodier\", he wrote: \"the deceit, cowardice, and silence of all too many African leaders, journalist and academics continue to facilitate the religious discrimination and persecution of radical Muslims to this day\". He even challenges that \"the fiction that Jihad had never been an act of aggression, but only defensive concept should be dismissed with the contempt that such deception deserves.\"\n\nITS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR AFRICA's MUSLIM INTELLECTUALS\n\nHistory, they said repeats itself in the minds of those who ignore it. In the era of \"The Dark Age\" when Europe was besieged by the \"Church\" and only Pope's verdicts and \"excommunication\" decrees were the laws of European life and sole terms of reference on governance, it was the \"liberal Christian\" intellectuals themselves who felt the sense of duty, obligatiin and the need for liberation from the yoke and did vehemently challenge and eventually defeated the Papal theocratic world order and system. In Africa too, the \"Muslim liberal intellectuals\" should take the front line seats in the debate, deliver more rational argument and solutions. With Africa shattering in the way it is, they need to help in defining the moment. Any further submissive positions will only allow the radical Islamists to firmly set their agenda, draw the battle lines and call the shot. The more these \"liberal intellectuals\" l exhibit silence, the wider political space fundamentalists will occupy and the more anarchic order dominates. Of course, that does not any way or by any means, waving the shared responsibility from the larger African intellectuals and elite community.", "Few poets stood higher on Joseph Stalin's hit list than Anna Akhmatova, the Soviet doyen of reverie and suffering who was born near the Black Sea in 1899 to an upper-class family. Like many in her literary milieu before the Russian Revolution, she revolted against drowsy symbolism and became a poet of spiritual clarity and of simplicity -- but she always resisted the characterization of her poems as the work of a seductive poetess or a counter-revolutionary. She preferred to consider herself a poet of the soul. Certainly, the architects of Soviet ideology, first under Lenin and later under Stalin, thought of her that way and set about trying to stop her from writing poetry of refined self-awareness. Censors accused her of flirting with mysticism and eroticism and lacking political conviction. As early as 1921, nine years after Akhmatova published her first book of poems, the Cheka arrested her former husband, Nikolai Gumilev, who was a charismatic figure in Russian poetry before 1917 and the father of her only child, on the trumped-up charge that he was an anti-Bolshevik conspirator. Three weeks later, he was executed. The charge was, of course, fabricated. His reputation would not be rehabilitated until 1992.\n\nFrom the early 1920s to the '50s Akhmatova's published works were officially suppressed, sanctioned as too feminine and not sufficiently Marxist. To inspire her -- let us say -- to write politically sympathetic poems, officials arrested her son and her husband. Both men spent time in gulags. And we know that Akhmatova was in the Moscow apartment of Osip Mandelstam when the secret police arrived to arrest him in 1934 for writing a poem critical of Stalin -- an arrest that would eventually lead to Mandelstam's death in 1938.\n\nThe harassment of Akhmatova's son, Lev Gumilev, came to dominate the poet's existence during the worst years of Stalin's terror. Since Lev was the offspring of two \"public enemies,\" his father, Nikolai Gumilev, and Akhmatova, he was arrested multiple times, imprisoned, released, reinvestigated, and threatened with execution (until his inquisitors fell victim to an internal Stalinist purge and were executed first). After World War II, Soviet authorities recommended that Lev change his last name to avoid arrest again. He refused so as not to betray his father's memory -- and was sentenced to a forced-labor camp. These actions were meant to intimidate Akhmatova into writing the patriotic poetry Communist ideologues expected from her. But she refused. Only after her son was arrested again in 1949 did she relent, publishing some dozen poems in half-hearted praise of Stalin's life as an emblem of freedom. Her effort was a failure. Censors found the work to be of little propaganda value. So her sacrifice was suppressed as well. Secretly, Akhmatova was writing her masterpiece, Requiem, about the sufferings of the Russian people under totalitarian rule. The poem was not published in Russian until 1987 during the Gorbachev era. But long before that, she was whispering lines to her closest friends, who worked to commit the poem to memory. Akhmatova would then burn the pages in an ashtray next to her cigarette butts. (She kept the original copy safely hidden.) Today, lines of Requiem are known by heart by millions of Russian schoolchildren. Akhmatova died of a heart attack in 1966.\n\nPresumably none of this history was on the mind of American singer-songwriter Iris DeMent when she and her husband adopted their daughter, Dasha, from Siberia in 2005, when the girl was six years old. It's a delicious irony that the most vivid country-soul album released last autumn should be DeMent's The Trackless Woods, in which DeMent sets to music eighteen of Akhmatova's poems, translated by Lyn Coffin and Babette Deutsch, as a gift to her young daughter, who now lives with her in Iowa and not, it goes without saying, in Vladimir Putin's regressive neo-Soviet nation-state. In the liner notes, DeMent writes:\n\nI didn't know any [of Akhmatova's tortured history] the day I came across a handful of her poems in a book a friend had loaned me. The cover of the book is red, with a drawing of a Russian samovar on it. The words \"An Anthology of Russian Verse\" are printed inside the samovar. I opened it up and read my first Anna Akhmatova poem, \"Like a White Stone,\" and by the time I'd finished reading it a second time, I felt like somebody (besides me) had started talking to me. What I heard was: \"Set that to music.\" So I did.\n\nThe album includes a good deal else, including compact totems of the trials of creative invention such as \"To My Poems,\" which goes:\n\nThese lines convey despair about the difficult process of writing, but also, paradoxically, feelings of devotion and tenderness. They evoke the sacrifices an artist makes to find the \"broad gold, the ... heavens glow,\" as Akhmatova writes in another poem \"covered\" on the album. One of DeMent's most moving renditions is the poem, \"Not with Deserters,\" which Akhmatova wrote out of disdain for Russian exiles:\n\nReading the poem now it's worth remembering that, in Requiem, Akhmatova refers to herself as the \"mouth through which a hundred million scream.\" The glum lines above are a rebuke to those who have fled Russia -- in effect, silencing themselves. Surely Akhmatova would not, imagining the future, include DeMent's daughter in her indictment. But it's fascinating to consider that DeMent is attempting to convey to her Russian-born daughter something of Akhmatova's pride of place. Speaking on NPR's Fresh Air, DeMent sounded sensitive to this question about her daughter: \"I didn't try to pull her along into that. The extent to which she absorbed [that part of her Russian culture] is her story to tell and yet to be seen in the future.\"\n\nFor many the album will raise interesting questions about the roots of creativity, too. Musicians have a long history of performing covers of each other's songs, and poets too have the tradition of responding to poems by other poets. DeMent's album is a peculiar crossover, where an American singer of soulful, heartland individualism sings \"covers\" of poems by Russia's iconic poet of elegant self-esteem in a pristine, back-of-the-choir Pentecostal voice. Akhmatova was a member of a group of writers, the Acmeists, who extolled the values of directness and clarified images. This characterization neatly describes what DeMent has been performing for more than two decades as well, beginning with her breakthrough album, Infamous Angel in 1992. Her music typically relies on just a few chords strummed on a clean-sounding guitar or sometimes a piano accompaniment that comes across like it's being played on a shabby upright shoved into the corner of a hallway -- The Trackless Woods recordings were made in DeMent's living room. If you've listened to her albums, you already know that her voice exudes old-timey plainness and humor, along with heartbreak and disillusionment.\n\nI know my comparison will evoke resistance. But like Akhmatova's poems, DeMent's songs depict people who exist not in the margins, but in the non-utopias of complex lives. They confront their own desperations and difficult joys, tensions and transformations. The figures in DeMent's songs thrive in passageways outside the noise of partisans and ideologues. \"Let the mystery be,\" DeMent sings in an early song against the pressure to believe in God, if not fundamentalism -- religious, political, or otherwise. This temperament resembles Akhmatova's in \"Song about Songs\" as she commends the body as a vessel for humility:\n\nAccompanied by an easy, parlor-piano rhythm, DeMent presents \"Song about Songs\" as a ballad for salvation in a voice that pines for the purity of love. The architecture of the material here is the countryside. It's like a dreamscape conjured up to encompass what a single body can see and hear and smell. It's a vision of direct movement against ideological and industrial culture. It's a pastoral rendition of a life intended to preserve one's dignity against the forces determined to slaughter it. What lingers from the ferocity of Stalin's terror -- as heard inside DeMent's renditions of Akhmatova's poems -- is the latter's non-revolutionary sensibility, her tragic sense of individual solitude:\n\nIt's difficult to hear these lyrics and not consider, even briefly, the backwardness, corruption, and despotism that have overtaken Akhmatova's Russia under the rule of Putin and what can only be called his Russia. To listen to DeMent's plaintive renditions of Akhmatova's poems in praise of the incorruptible soul makes you feel deeply dispirited over the resurgent nostalgia for the Soviet era today under Putin, who, prowling the Kremlin like a KGB czar, trucks in ethnic Russian nationalist paranoia, is hostile to democratic reform, advances a sovereignty of personal power, and embraces a narrative of Russian history that begins with grievances with the West and ends with missing or mutilated Russian citizens who are critical of Putin and his autocratic regime. And -- thinking closer to home -- it's fair to ask whether the state of the soul is being jeopardized here in the United States as well. Couldn't DeMent's partnership with Akhmatova be equally indicting of nativist and sometimes violent impulses in our political dialogue? Consider, by way of illustration, this thuggish scene from a Donald Trump campaign rally reported by Ryan Lizza recently in The New Yorker:\n\nTrump's fans tend to express little regard for political norms. They cheer at his most outlandish statements. [Bill] O'Reilly asked Trump if he meant it when he said that he would \"take out\" the family members of terrorists. He didn't believe that Trump would \"put out hits on women and children\" if he were elected. Trump replied, \"I would do pretty severe stuff.\" The Mesa crowd erupted in applause. \"Yeah, baby!\" a man near me yelled. I had never previously been to a political event at which people cheered for the murder of women and children.\n\nCould the world be made new in DeMent's versions of Akhmatova's work? Of course not. DeMent's songs don't abolish the intent of Akhmatova's poems (that would be impossible). But they do more than simply pay homage. Both DeMent's singing and Akhmatova's poetry are arguments against obsoletism and in favor of an artist's solitary interior. This is DeMent's great gift to the poems of Anna Akhmatova and to devotees of her poetry. She has given us a transcription and new reading of another language, culture, and political time, and then offers all that as a message to our own time -- though principally as a gift to her young, Russian-born daughter. In this sense it is not too much to say that DeMent nearly redeems Akhmatova's futile gift of debased patriotic poems she once resentfully offered to Stalin as a means to rescue her son.\n\nTo go through this album is to realize how much Stalin's reign was, among other things, an onslaught against language and the worship of the machine of state power. H was, above all, a wretched genius for scandal and murder. By remaining a poet of the soul who is true to the interior life, Akhmatova was a provocateur. She is also a prototype for the kind of soul-seeking artist DeMent has become. This is the primitive spirit DeMent brings forward in The Trackless Woods. She turns traditionalist Russian poetry into one American artist's private revolution to extol and defend the individual unconscious. For how do you create poetry and songs except to write from the most interior margins of selfhood?\n\nDavid Biespiel's most recent book is A Long High Whistle: Selected Columns on Poetry.", "Edward Snowden didn't reveal anything we didn't already know. At least, he didn't reveal anything that privacy advocates or the global intelligence community weren't already keenly aware of.\n\nWhat Snowden did do was become the public face of digital privacy advocacy backed by a trove of Orwellian PowerPoint slides. (It also didn't hurt that he's disarmingly eloquent and possesses boy-next-door good looks which just ooze aw shucks all over the place.)\n\nSnowden brought issues of near-unfettered digital surveillance front and center. And people got angry about the loss of their privacy! Or rather, people in the techblogosphere got pretty pissed off about it. The public, for their part, were only so-so outraged by the prospect of mass surveillance.\n\nIn truth, most people just don't feel like they have any real need to fear surveillance. In fact, people have repeatedly shown that they value convenience far more than privacy.\n\nWhile the polls routinely reflect the public's overall meh-ness regarding government snooping (among U.S. citizens, at least), security issues they do care about inevitably arise when the government mandates backdoor vulnerabilities be hardwired into a technological ecosystem. While these backdoors are ostensibly constructed for \"nobody but us\" to get through (a concept that even has its own shorthand: NOBUS), history has shown that they will be discovered and utilized by hackers and other bad guys.\n\nAnd that leads us to Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent dust-up with the FBI.\n\nCook has taken a startlingly bold stance for privacy in defiance of a judge's order to help the government break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. On its face, this fight appears to be a purely (and admirably) principled stand by the planet's largest publicly traded company. While Silicon Valley has lined up in support of Apple, the reaction from politicians and government officials has been overwhelmingly negative (occasionally bordering on absurdly dramatic). Meanwhile, support from the public -- who this defiance is presumably in service of -- has been painfully tepid.\n\nWhile there is no doubt some core principles influencing Cook's defiance, I can't help but think that there's a business-minded agenda in the mix as well. Similar to the way that executives at Facebook and Google are unquestionably earnest in their desire to connect billions in developing countries to the Internet, there also just happens to be an opportunity to make a buck if they are the ones who do the connecting.\n\nIt would have been exceeding easy for Apple to capitulate to the judge's orders and help the government break into the phone (\"sorry, our hands were tied!\"), and therefore help infiltrate an unquestionably brutal and threatening fanatical organization. That decision might have drawn some condemnation from privacy advocates, but most people would have remained blissfully unaware that it ever happened.\n\nHowever, when Cook decided to fight the order in a very public way, it helped Apple become synonymous with privacy and security (which might stand in contrast to the rival Android ecosystem and its many, many security issues), not to mention willful non-compliance with authorities. Cynicism might dictate that this non-compliance is all about Apple wanting to sell more iPhones in the increasingly important, if quasi-totalitarian, Chinese market (or anywhere outside the U.S. for that matter). And that may be part of it, though Apple denies it. But I think it actually has to do with the products that Apple is preparing for the decade(s) to come.\n\nMachines are becoming far more personal. They're getting smaller and lighter; they are with us all day. In a relative blink of history, computers went from taking up entire rooms to being a thing we wrap around our wrists.\n\nAnd they're taking on more tasks all the time; increasingly personal tasks at that. They are handling our financial transactions, monitoring our bodies, and even conversing with us using real language. They are taking over the ways we interact our vehicles, and soon enough will take complete control of them.\n\nThe line between software and meatware will only continue to blur. I have little reason to doubt that the scorching hot wearables space will -- in the not crazy future -- give way to implantables. That may seem like a sci-fi step too far for many, but mark my words, this is a thing that will happen. If we don't see a commercially available implantable electronic device by 2026, reach out to me, I'll owe you a coke.\n\nThe transition isn't too hard to imagine. If there was a way for a tiny device to provide a steady stream of visual and audio (and possibly haptic) stimulation that was accessible hands-free at all times, wouldn't you want it? Sound crazy? Look around your local Starbucks and see how just about everybody has their faces buried in their phones -- the fact that they have to actually hold it up with their hands is only an engineering barrier that has yet to be overcome.\n\nIf getting a tiny device attached to your person was as routine and safe as getting one's ears pierced, a good part of the population would gladly sign up. When I hear doubts that this transition could ever happen (some within the very offices here at PCMag), I am reminded of conversations I had with my parents in the late 1990s when I was scolded (yes scolded!) for a needless and exuberant purchase of my first \"cellular phone.\" You already have a phone at home and work, do you really need to have a phone on you at all times? Fast forward to today and I am routinely contacted (by cell phone) to help these same parents with their smartphone issues.\n\nTechnology evolves, and people evolve with it. The future promises that technology is gonna get all up in your business.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind with the coming storm of tech-all-up-in-your-business business is that consumers will only adopt these increasingly intimate devices if they feel secure. This is something that tech luminaries such as Mr. Cook are surely cognizant.\n\nThe first time someone is injured when a self-driving car is commandeered by a bored hacker in Ukraine, people will stop using that brand of self-driving car. The same goes for the first time someone breaks into the fitness tracker being monitored by your doctor; the supposedly secure wireless payment platform; or yes, the implantable device you can't easily remove.\n\nHackers and bad players have always been with the Internet. As technology drags both our minds and bodies further into The Matrix, consumers will only want to do business with companies that take the security of our most intimate selves very seriously.", "William Horden Author: The Toltec I Ching; In The Oneness Of Time\n\nAt the opposing pole of contemporary worldviews held by the Religious Right stands the Spiritual Left. Its relationship to the Political Left is analogous to, but more poorly defined than, that between the Religious Right and Political Right. The principle difference between those two poles lies in the way history is -- or is not -- used to command allegiance.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThose who remember history are doomed to repeat it.\n\nWhat a miserable story of exploitation and suffering human history is: An endless litany of wrongs and revenges, hatreds and guilts, victims and perpetrators. Our inability to forget the past keeps it alive, an oozing wound that never has the chance to heal. Like a ship dragging its anchor, we do not sail into the future because we do not jettison our collective history of enmity.\n\nWe go to extraordinary lengths to remember past glories (the \"conquest\" of other peoples and/or the wilds of nature) and humiliations (other people's past glories at our expense). It isn't just public education that keeps regurgitating past history, of course -- it's politicians and military strategists and their disinformation arm, the media. Conflicts, hatreds, wrongs: There is no offensive act that can't be justified by the past.\n\nWe refuse to forget history and so we keep repeating it.\n\nThings do not change and that is what conservatives want. That is what conservative means. Hold on to the past. Resist change. Return to the past.\n\nWhile some factions of monotheistic religions promote progressive and liberal ideals, most find that the conservative nature of their dogma aligns with the objectives of the political right. The marriage of the religious right and the political right is not confined to the U.S. culture war, of course -- and we do not have to look hard to see just how facilely that marriage gives birth to theocracy, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism.\n\nTHE SPIRITUAL LEFT\n\nThe Spiritual Left is the complement of the Religious Right. The other half of the human psyche. The half grounded in a trust of life rather than a fear of it.\n\nIt is progressive, in the sense that it seeks out positive change, seeks to move on, seeks a better vision. It is liberal, in the sense that it accepts differences, embraces differences, finds the sameness within differences. It is progressive and liberal in the sense that it not restrained by the past: It does not simply forget the past -- it forgives and it seeks forgiveness.\n\nIt is, however, first and foremost, a spiritual lifeway.\n\nLifeways that identify as spiritual rather than traditionally religious tend to focus on the present. A spiritual practice often entails cultivating sincere goodwill toward all and a consistent \"mindful\" awareness of the present moment. Despite its ancient roots in indigenous animistic worldviews, it is a curiously modern perspective in the sense of living consciously within the relativity of an Einsteinian universe (in which there is no objective past-present-future) and the instantaneity of a quantum-entangled universe (in which information passes instantly, unconstrained by distance). Both ancient and modern, this spiritual practice of living-in-the-present involves an authentic relinquishing of cognitive-emotional attachments to the past, as well as hopes, fears and expectations of the future. It is a positive disinterestedness in the fallacies of memory and projection in favor of the living present.\n\nHowever, the present moment does not mean just attending to the ever-flowing stream of \"news\" generated by corporate and social media. Such one-sided focus on the completely ephemeral and skewed opinions of professionals and nonprofessionals alike subsumes all the other, more essential, facets of our present experience of the universe. The present moment is the totality of raw experience, unfiltered by our internal running commentary on experience. It encompasses the totality of internal and external experiences stemming from our interactions with culture and nature. A spiritual lifeway leads to contentment precisely because it calls us to disengage from the social conditioning which, like gravity, pulls us back toward groupthink and away from our natural state of buoyant free-thinking individuality.\n\nLikewise wisdom does not mean forgetting the lessons humanity has gleaned from its collective past--rather, it means not fetishizing past experiences.\n\nAt its best, the spiritual left embodies wisdom and compassion. Not the rote wisdom of dogma, but the creative and adaptive response of intuitive intelligence to changing circumstances -- a kind of wisdom that subordinates self-interest to the greatest good and deals with the long-range consequences of actions ahead of time. Nor is it the golden rule receiving little more than lip service on Sunday, but the compassion of deep-seated identification with the sacred nature of people and nature without exception.\n\nThe alignment of the spiritual left and the political left is a natural alliance, since they share many of the same values of egalitarianism and peaceful coexistence. But it is also a tenuous one, since the political left has become embroiled in a power struggle with the political right that runs counter to the deepest values of the spiritual left.\n\nThe political left, in other words, has taken the bait of the right and entered into an antagonistic relationship that has polarized a nation into political paralysis.\n\nIn a highly-charged polarized environment, what does venting anger and outright rejection of the other side accomplish but reinforce their own righteous indignation and the sense that their way of life is under attack? Certainly, this is the effect of the left's words and actions upon the right--but it is no less so the effect of the right's words and actions upon the left.\n\nBoth sides dig in deeper, in a kind of mental trench warfare, lobbing word bombs and political strategies at one another in the vain belief that victory will soon be won. It is a war of scoring points, as if the other side will finally be convinced either by superior reasoning or votes.\n\nThe U.S. has become the Indig-Nation: Everything the right does stirs righteous indignation in the left, everything the left does stirs righteous indignation in the right. From the standpoint of the spiritual left, the strategy of the political left is not working -- it simply contributes to the ongoing polarization of the citizenry while the real opponents, the ruling oligarchy, continue to dictate the direction of civilization from the shadows.\n\nWisdom considers it axiomatic that everyone acts for the sake of what they believe to be good.\n\nWithin a political context, this presents as the basis of compassion and empathy. Even with those we oppose ideologically, we can be moved to understand their perspective and make the effort to move them to the center. At the very least, we can avoid retreating into sophisticated cynicism and clever irony as a means of ridiculing others' positions. A moderate position to adopt is to recognize that others are sincere in the pursuit of their beliefs and so, to neither take offense nor give offense.\n\nSelf-criticism is an essential part of wisdom, one that brings our respective shortcomings into sharp relief. This is especially valuable when reflecting on the relationship between the spiritual left and the political left and the way they mutually strengthen one another: Just as the spiritual left learns from the political left that it must not withdraw from the world of action, the political left learns from the spiritual left that it must not right wrongs by committing wrongs.\n\nOnce we have adopted the tactics of the right, we have ceded the moral high ground. And without the moral high ground, minds cannot be changed nor can hearts be won.\n\nCHANGE\n\nWe have arrived at the turning point: At the pinnacle of waxing, the inevitable waning begins. This is a lesson, not the memory of a specific historical event -- one that encompasses a wide swath of human experience and is grounded in recognizable cycles of natural phenomena. Once something has reached the limits of its growth, it needs to contract back onto itself in order to consolidate its resources in preparation for the next cycle of growth.\n\nIt is a lesson embodying the famous saying by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa in his novel, The Leopard: \"If we want things to stay as they are, everything will have to change.\" If we want to continue to have anything like the kind of life we have now, we will need to make fundamental system-wide adaptations to a world of escalating social and environmental change. It is, of course, upon this point that the right and left must ultimately build consensus.\n\nPolitical strategies running contrary to wisdom, on the other hand, arrogantly seek to expand the nation's influence forever. With the inevitable result of depleting its energy, resources and national will. In place of a measured strategic contraction, such tactics precipitate a fall from the very power they sought to seize and hold. Anyone advocating for continued expansion of influence, power, or environmental exploitation in this time is blind to the writing on the wall.\n\nMoving beyond history allows us to encounter change -- and when has such a confluence of profound technological, environmental and social changes ever converged? We live in a time without precedent and we know it. No generation before us has faced such a perfect storm of change.\n\nWhat especially distinguishes this from other times is that we ourselves are making decisions that can either escalate these global problems or defuse them. Paradoxically, we as individuals are empowering ourselves by making constructive decisions even as our social institutions continue exacerbating the problems, contributing to our underlying sense of powerlessness. This disconnect between the citizenry and their rulers has become a symptom of failed nation-states and one that any self-aware ruling body corrects without hesitation.\n\nEncountering change means not getting distracted by contrived issues. It entails seeing through the hype of corporate and social media and into the heart of those problems of the first magnitude, those problems affecting the human race itself. There is no other way to draw people together and move into a present marked by collaboration and cooperation. Other peoples cannot trust our motives until we consistently demonstrate a selflessness of purpose -- one that strives for peace and prospering for all people everywhere, absent any advantage for ourselves.\n\nEncountering change means looking at why things aren't changing for the better. Purely political solutions that fail to incorporate wisdom and compassion don't change things because they are aimed at the wrong target. It takes both wisdom and compassion to reach the inevitable goal of universal amnesty and reconciliation. Any other goal is secondary, as it requires a unified citizenry to establish a viable civilization for hundreds of generations to come. Is there really any other goal worthy of our lives and deaths?\n\nThis quote of Frida Kahlo perfectly captures the spirit of the Spiritual Left, which holds that the mundane issues will resolve themselves once the universal issues have been resolved. It is the power of imagination -- not reason or memory -- that gives the human psyche flight, allowing it to discover unsuspected and unforeseen solutions to long-standing problems. It is in the landscape of the imagination, as well, that people of all cultures and all times meet on the common ground of art, music and philosophy.\n\nSUM\n\nEncountering change is not dissimilar to staring wide-eyed into a gale-force wind. It is seldom comfortable, causing as it does the stress of uncertainty and insecurity. It can blur our vision, causing us to see things that aren't there even as it causes us to miss things that are. But change is the present moment. It never occurs in the past or future. It is where our full attention needs to dwell if we are to maintain that unique ability to adapt readily to extraordinary circumstances which made our most ancient ancestors the species of such extraordinary potential that it did.", "Few poets stood higher on Joseph Stalin's hit list than Anna Akhmatova, the Soviet doyen of reverie and suffering who was born near the Black Sea in 1899 to an upper-class family. Like many in her literary milieu before the Russian Revolution, she revolted against drowsy symbolism and became a poet of spiritual clarity and of simplicity -- but she always resisted the characterization of her poems as the work of a seductive poetess or a counter-revolutionary. She preferred to consider herself a poet of the soul. Certainly, the architects of Soviet ideology, first under Lenin and later under Stalin, thought of her that way and set about trying to stop her from writing poetry of refined self-awareness. Censors accused her of flirting with mysticism and eroticism and lacking political conviction. As early as 1921, nine years after Akhmatova published her first book of poems, the Cheka arrested her former husband, Nikolai Gumilev, who was a charismatic figure in Russian poetry before 1917 and the father of her only child, on the trumped-up charge that he was an anti-Bolshevik conspirator. Three weeks later, he was executed. The charge was, of course, fabricated. His reputation would not be rehabilitated until 1992.\n\nFrom the early 1920s to the '50s Akhmatova's published works were officially suppressed, sanctioned as too feminine and not sufficiently Marxist. To inspire her -- let us say -- to write politically sympathetic poems, officials arrested her son and her husband. Both men spent time in gulags. And we know that Akhmatova was in the Moscow apartment of Osip Mandelstam when the secret police arrived to arrest him in 1934 for writing a poem critical of Stalin -- an arrest that would eventually lead to Mandelstam's death in 1938.\n\nThe harassment of Akhmatova's son, Lev Gumilev, came to dominate the poet's existence during the worst years of Stalin's terror. Since Lev was the offspring of two \"public enemies,\" his father, Nikolai Gumilev, and Akhmatova, he was arrested multiple times, imprisoned, released, reinvestigated, and threatened with execution (until his inquisitors fell victim to an internal Stalinist purge and were executed first). After World War II, Soviet authorities recommended that Lev change his last name to avoid arrest again. He refused so as not to betray his father's memory -- and was sentenced to a forced-labor camp. These actions were meant to intimidate Akhmatova into writing the patriotic poetry Communist ideologues expected from her. But she refused. Only after her son was arrested again in 1949 did she relent, publishing some dozen poems in half-hearted praise of Stalin's life as an emblem of freedom. Her effort was a failure. Censors found the work to be of little propaganda value. So her sacrifice was suppressed as well. Secretly, Akhmatova was writing her masterpiece, Requiem, about the sufferings of the Russian people under totalitarian rule. The poem was not published in Russian until 1987 during the Gorbachev era. But long before that, she was whispering lines to her closest friends, who worked to commit the poem to memory. Akhmatova would then burn the pages in an ashtray next to her cigarette butts. (She kept the original copy safely hidden.) Today, lines of Requiem are known by heart by millions of Russian schoolchildren. Akhmatova died of a heart attack in 1966.\n\nPresumably none of this history was on the mind of American singer-songwriter Iris DeMent when she and her husband adopted their daughter, Dasha, from Siberia in 2005, when the girl was six years old. It's a delicious irony that the most vivid country-soul album released last autumn should be DeMent's The Trackless Woods, in which DeMent sets to music eighteen of Akhmatova's poems, translated by Lyn Coffin and Babette Deutsch, as a gift to her young daughter, who now lives with her in Iowa and not, it goes without saying, in Vladimir Putin's regressive neo-Soviet nation-state. In the liner notes, DeMent writes:\n\nI didn't know any [of Akhmatova's tortured history] the day I came across a handful of her poems in a book a friend had loaned me. The cover of the book is red, with a drawing of a Russian samovar on it. The words \"An Anthology of Russian Verse\" are printed inside the samovar. I opened it up and read my first Anna Akhmatova poem, \"Like a White Stone,\" and by the time I'd finished reading it a second time, I felt like somebody (besides me) had started talking to me. What I heard was: \"Set that to music.\" So I did.\n\nThe album includes a good deal else, including compact totems of the trials of creative invention such as \"To My Poems,\" which goes:\n\nThese lines convey despair about the difficult process of writing, but also, paradoxically, feelings of devotion and tenderness. They evoke the sacrifices an artist makes to find the \"broad gold, the ... heavens glow,\" as Akhmatova writes in another poem \"covered\" on the album. One of DeMent's most moving renditions is the poem, \"Not with Deserters,\" which Akhmatova wrote out of disdain for Russian exiles:\n\nReading the poem now it's worth remembering that, in Requiem, Akhmatova refers to herself as the \"mouth through which a hundred million scream.\" The glum lines above are a rebuke to those who have fled Russia -- in effect, silencing themselves. Surely Akhmatova would not, imagining the future, include DeMent's daughter in her indictment. But it's fascinating to consider that DeMent is attempting to convey to her Russian-born daughter something of Akhmatova's pride of place. Speaking on NPR's Fresh Air, DeMent sounded sensitive to this question about her daughter: \"I didn't try to pull her along into that. The extent to which she absorbed [that part of her Russian culture] is her story to tell and yet to be seen in the future.\"\n\nFor many the album will raise interesting questions about the roots of creativity, too. Musicians have a long history of performing covers of each other's songs, and poets too have the tradition of responding to poems by other poets. DeMent's album is a peculiar crossover, where an American singer of soulful, heartland individualism sings \"covers\" of poems by Russia's iconic poet of elegant self-esteem in a pristine, back-of-the-choir Pentecostal voice. Akhmatova was a member of a group of writers, the Acmeists, who extolled the values of directness and clarified images. This characterization neatly describes what DeMent has been performing for more than two decades as well, beginning with her breakthrough album, Infamous Angel in 1992. Her music typically relies on just a few chords strummed on a clean-sounding guitar or sometimes a piano accompaniment that comes across like it's being played on a shabby upright shoved into the corner of a hallway -- The Trackless Woods recordings were made in DeMent's living room. If you've listened to her albums, you already know that her voice exudes old-timey plainness and humor, along with heartbreak and disillusionment.\n\nI know my comparison will evoke resistance. But like Akhmatova's poems, DeMent's songs depict people who exist not in the margins, but in the non-utopias of complex lives. They confront their own desperations and difficult joys, tensions and transformations. The figures in DeMent's songs thrive in passageways outside the noise of partisans and ideologues. \"Let the mystery be,\" DeMent sings in an early song against the pressure to believe in God, if not fundamentalism -- religious, political, or otherwise. This temperament resembles Akhmatova's in \"Song about Songs\" as she commends the body as a vessel for humility:\n\nAccompanied by an easy, parlor-piano rhythm, DeMent presents \"Song about Songs\" as a ballad for salvation in a voice that pines for the purity of love. The architecture of the material here is the countryside. It's like a dreamscape conjured up to encompass what a single body can see and hear and smell. It's a vision of direct movement against ideological and industrial culture. It's a pastoral rendition of a life intended to preserve one's dignity against the forces determined to slaughter it. What lingers from the ferocity of Stalin's terror -- as heard inside DeMent's renditions of Akhmatova's poems -- is the latter's non-revolutionary sensibility, her tragic sense of individual solitude:\n\nIt's difficult to hear these lyrics and not consider, even briefly, the backwardness, corruption, and despotism that have overtaken Akhmatova's Russia under the rule of Putin and what can only be called his Russia. To listen to DeMent's plaintive renditions of Akhmatova's poems in praise of the incorruptible soul makes you feel deeply dispirited over the resurgent nostalgia for the Soviet era today under Putin, who, prowling the Kremlin like a KGB czar, trucks in ethnic Russian nationalist paranoia, is hostile to democratic reform, advances a sovereignty of personal power, and embraces a narrative of Russian history that begins with grievances with the West and ends with missing or mutilated Russian citizens who are critical of Putin and his autocratic regime. And -- thinking closer to home -- it's fair to ask whether the state of the soul is being jeopardized here in the United States as well. Couldn't DeMent's partnership with Akhmatova be equally indicting of nativist and sometimes violent impulses in our political dialogue? Consider, by way of illustration, this thuggish scene from a Donald Trump campaign rally reported by Ryan Lizza recently in The New Yorker:\n\nTrump's fans tend to express little regard for political norms. They cheer at his most outlandish statements. [Bill] O'Reilly asked Trump if he meant it when he said that he would \"take out\" the family members of terrorists. He didn't believe that Trump would \"put out hits on women and children\" if he were elected. Trump replied, \"I would do pretty severe stuff.\" The Mesa crowd erupted in applause. \"Yeah, baby!\" a man near me yelled. I had never previously been to a political event at which people cheered for the murder of women and children.\n\nCould the world be made new in DeMent's versions of Akhmatova's work? Of course not. DeMent's songs don't abolish the intent of Akhmatova's poems (that would be impossible). But they do more than simply pay homage. Both DeMent's singing and Akhmatova's poetry are arguments against obsoletism and in favor of an artist's solitary interior. This is DeMent's great gift to the poems of Anna Akhmatova and to devotees of her poetry. She has given us a transcription and new reading of another language, culture, and political time, and then offers all that as a message to our own time -- though principally as a gift to her young, Russian-born daughter. In this sense it is not too much to say that DeMent nearly redeems Akhmatova's futile gift of debased patriotic poems she once resentfully offered to Stalin as a means to rescue her son.\n\nTo go through this album is to realize how much Stalin's reign was, among other things, an onslaught against language and the worship of the machine of state power.

While media focus on the transition of power has concentrated on building continuity between successive administrations of government, one thing that should not be allowed to continue is the woeful act of national branding.\n\nTaiwan is not alone in the practice of national branding, nor is the concept new. Historically, ideology has played center stage in differentiating Taiwan -- during the Cold War era as a \"bastion of democracy\" (in the guise of \"Free China\") -- vis-\u00e0-vis the totalitarianism of Mao's Red China. Following the end of martial law and democratic transformation, the island's indigenous culture came into focus, as well as an understandable attempt to draw attention to Taiwan's diplomatic isolation. Government ad campaigns in the 1990s plastered the world \"UN-Fair\" on newspapers worldwide to highlight the R.O.C.'s exclusion from the United Nations.\n\nYet, the commercialization of nationalism in recent years has evolved increasingly to serve market ideologies tied to product promotion and the promotion of particular sectors such as tourism, finance and communications. Globally, due to the prevalence of trade literature and ratings systems tied to often dubiously substantiated notions of national competitiveness, nations are being promoted as brands. When a nation become synonymous with a product, a whole host of indicators become highlighted in order to maintain, advertise and promote certain perceptions of the country.\n\nThe materialistic roots of this development should be taken into context when considering this development. Taiwan's position during the post-war Keynesian world order led by the United States in the postwar period gave it unprecedented access to \"free world\" economies. The ubiquitous \"Made in Taiwan\" sticker became synonymous with the country's public image as a manufacturing powerhouse as one of the four Asian Tigers (along with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea).\n\nWith exclusionary practices of capitalism rising in the 1990s with the advent of bilateral free-trade agreements at the cost of multilateral trade agreements, Taiwan's former position as an exporter was challenged. It witnessed its dominant position as an efficient producer of cheap goods threatened by rival upstarts including China. The state-business nexus started to advocate industrial upgrading and the building of international brands in order to improve economic prospects.", "A conversation between the political strategist of Podemos and a theoretical referent of the postmarxist left shows the potential impact of the Latin-American political ideas and practices.

Some rights reserved.\n\nErrej\u00f3n: In my case, getting to know the popular and constituent processes and the political transformation and state reform initiatives in Latin America was decisive in my way of thinking about politics. These processes are impossible to know from Spain. What you see in the media here is a tale of the never-ending, terrible mess allegedly existing in Latin American societies, which are considered infantile because they keep on voting the way they do. To some of us, the direct knowledge of experiences that can translate discontent into a new collective, popular and national will and can have an impact on the state has been very helpful. Collective will cannot change everything, but the state reform and transition processes involved are nevertheless significant.\n\nIn any case, these processes are definitely helpful in thinking about categories and testing them, but whether they are models to follow is quite another matter. In our case, they cannot be taken as referents, due to huge and obvious cultural, geopolitical and economic differences. Our societies are not broken, our poverty levels are not as brutal as in Latin America in the final decades of the 20th century, nor is a progressive process, in our case, facing the challenge of building a national state almost from scratch.\n\nIn Latin America, several popular processes have undertaken some historic tasks - such as citizen inclusion, creation of public services, or fiscal reform - which are similar to those developed by social-democracy in Europe. Admittedly, with more turbulence there, due to oligarchic resistances and the absence of peripheries bearing the brunt of the costs. Political change in Spain and Southern Europe is needed, precisely, in order to avoid the vicious spiral of indebtedness-expenditure cuts/poverty, social fragmentation and institutional collapse, as witnessed in several Latin American countries during the lost decade of the 1990s. It is not a matter of demolishing anything, but of preventing the selfishness and shortcomings of those in charge from demolishing the institutions and the protective mechanisms which are the collective heritage of our societies.\n\nM.: You have said that your experience in Latin America was instrumental, that it led you to see things quite differently. It was somehow your \"road to Damascus\"?\n\nE.: Yes, I began to be politically active at the age of 14, and for a long time I was active under quite different categories and from a quite different approach. At some point, I was much more influenced by what in Italy is known as the autonomy areas and by the practices of some of its thinkers, which fascinated us for their radicalism and their theoretical sophistication. Later, I combined this with other haphazard readings. And some Gramsci, to be sure.\n\nBut then I landed in Latin America and I realized that the categories I was carrying in my bag were not enough. They were not helpful in reflecting on what was happening all around me, what I was experiencing. Not because of any cultural essentialism or de-colonial new age reason, but because I found myself facing events that forced me to think about the meaning of national, the state, power, hegemony - and what I was bringing with me were resistance categories.\n\nM.: In a way, something similar happened to me. I was a fairly orthodox Althusserian, but after some years teaching philosophy in Colombia, at the National University of Bogot\u00e1, I changed my perspective. This is why I decided to come back to Europe and specialize in political science and I began working on Gramsci.\n\nE.: On the other hand, when I arrived in Bolivia in 2006, I was strongly influenced by the anti-globalization protests and the reception of the Zapatista movement in Europe, but also the protests and the counter-power building in Argentina on December 19 and 20, 2001, the Brazilian Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), the water and gas war in Bolivia - but not so much the following electoral process -, etc.\n\nSoon after arriving in Bolivia, I came across the national-popular concept, which by then had not yet been theoretically developed. I got to know it, to touch it, to read it. Not the theorists, but its developers, the people behind the national popular experiences in several countries in the region. I was already interested in nation building phenomena, such as the case of Catalonia, for instance, but in Latin America popular nationalism made me discover a new dimension.\n\nI admit I was fascinated by the ambivalence of the national-popular approach: the power of strong political identities that are not located within the right-left spectrum, their popular nature and their construction.\n\nI also began to be concerned about the state as an object of study and serious political engagement. I lived in, I worked with, I advised and accompanied processes of accessing the state and entering government by commoner or subaltern coalitions, surrounded by conservative powers that tried to limit change. So, I could see from inside a war of positions within the state, which I was directly involved in. I experienced the difficulties of trying out ideas, but this, far from discouraging me, opened a field of research which I found really exciting. I also learnt to value the costs of conquests and how to build irreversibility, which from then on became for me a central object of intellectual concern. I remember coming across some statistics in Bolivia which showed that, since the political change in the country, children tended to weight more as a result of better access to milk. And I remember thinking that this may not have been thanks to socialism, but that on the other hand it would be foolish to rule it out, considering the costs of consolidating that precarious social development.\n\nThinking about it now, I find it surprising that there has been no critical revision of the phenomena, the actors and the strategies which we chose during the crisis of the neoliberal model in Latin America. The Zapatistas, the Brazilian MST, the picket assemblies (piqueteras) assembled under the slogan \"out with them all\", and all the theorizing which saw in this protest cycle a matrix for the practices that would change things in favour of the majorities which were building counter-powers outside the state: \"changing the world without taking power\". Seen from today, the results are disappointing: where there was no electoral conquest of power and access to the state in order to wage within it a war of positions between emancipatory and conservative and oligarchic forces, social mobilization decreased - it always does - and today living conditions for the popular sectors are much worse.\n\nM.: For certain leftist groups in Europe, the influence of the Latin American experiences has gone in a different direction from yours and mine. I think it is odd, for instance, that several sectors of the European left continue to present the piqueteros experience in Argentina as a model to imitate. The literature that promotes the exodus strategy often celebrates this movement of unemployed people that began to organize street and road blocks against President Carlos Menem's neoliberal policies at the end of the 90s. As a matter of fact, during the economic crisis of 2001-2002, they gathered in cooperative organizations and were very active in the popular demonstrations that overthrew Fernando de la R\u00faa's government. With their motto \"out with them all\", they proclaimed their rejection of all politicians and called for self-organization of the popular sectors. Exodus theorists see piqueteros as a paradigmatic example of the political expression of crowds, and they present their rejection of any collaboration with the political parties as a model for the desertion strategy. They do not seem to realize that the piqueteros movement actually shows the limits of this strategy. Undoubtedly, they contributed to the overthrow of a president. But, because of their refusal to participate in the electoral process, when it came to offering an alternative, they were incapable of influencing subsequent events. If it had not been for the fact that N\u00e9stor Kirchner won the elections and began implementing progressive measures to restore the Argentinean economy and improve the situation of the poor sectors of the population, the end result of the popular protests would have been quite different. The democratic improvements that occurred in Argentina under N\u00e9stor Kirchner's and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's governments were possible thanks to the synergy between the government and several social movements focused on addressing the social and socio-economic challenges facing the country. Far from offering a successful example for the desertion strategy, the Argentinean case revealed the shortcomings of such a strategy. What should be noted here is the importance of combining parliamentary and extra-parliamentary struggles in a common battle to transform the power configuration within the framework of pluralist democracy.\n\nE.: This is an important experience. On the one hand, many of those who stand for election do not come from an already established force. That is, they do not win because they already count on a political force backing them; they win because they participate in an electoral process that shapes a new identity. That is to say, Kirchnerism is a well-defined and relatively new political space in Argentina which still retains, at least for the time being, some power capacity. But, on the other hand, we need to evaluate the living conditions of the majorities today.\n\nIn many Latin American countries, neoliberal reforms and their impoverishing effects met with strong political crises and cycles of social protest which had the power to even veto these reforms. Some of them coincided with elections which were presented as plebiscites between a decadent order and a new popular will in the making, and governments were formed which have been able to open constituent or state reform processes and deploy transformative policies that have improved living conditions for those at the bottom of the social scale. Where social protest did not impact the state and refused to enter the power struggle, the improvements achieved by the mobilizations were reversed when activism decreased or when the situation \"calmed down\". Where discontent became a commoner irruption that broke into the state, transition processes, with all their contradictions and their more or less inevitable problems, have set in motion a virtuous circle by which millions of people have been taken out of poverty, while building national and regional sovereignty. I think it is obvious which experiences I am referring to in each case. A critical appraisal should be made of all of them, because some were really beautiful, with much predicament especially for the intellectual and cultural spheres of the European left, but they have not managed to change their countries and they have eventually found themselves in a dead end.\n\nI am not saying that it will necessarily be like this forever, nor am I saying that it is the expression of a paradigm: I am just describing what happened in that specific cycle in Latin America. Ultimately, in our societies a part of the political power derives from the ability to convince and to express this conviction in the electoral battle. There is another part of the political power that comes from the \"barrel of a gun\", as Mao Zedong would say: enforcement capacity. We are, of course, talking about two ideal types, we are simplifying. But these are the two poles that define the options that power faces in decisive situations. There are not many more options, let us say, not many paradigms for accessing or building political power.\n\nM.: I find it really disturbing that, in the majority of South American countries, the so-called leftist forces are against the national popular governments. In Argentina, the parties that are supposed to be leftist oppose Kirshnerism. In Ecuador, they are against Correa's government.\n\nE.: Indeed. This is so because these national-popular governments have also broken the rules of the traditional political game, that of the parliamentarian symbolic geographies. All the popular experiences in Latin America have been heretical, and have thus also broken the identification rules, they have built a commoner, popular national identity which has disconcerted not only the liberal and conservative sectors, and the privileged minorities, but also much of the cosmopolitan and Euro-centered left which, I believe, has traditionally misunderstood the situation in their own countries.\n\nWhenever there has been mass progress, history has been \"brushed against the grain\" - in the revolution bibles as well. They have always seen in it a political logic of their own, always with nationalist characteristics, contravening the handbooks (in tactical decisions, in operating procedures and the conveying of nodal demands, in the social sectors involved, etc.). Of course, manuals were created in Europe, and if they have never worked here... how could they work there!\n\nPeruvian Jose Carlos Mariategui has been vindicating a brand of socialism that would not \"imitate or a carbon-copy\" the European models. A socialism that would, for instance, allow for understanding and addressing the indigenous question beyond the narrowness of the classist moulds. Ultimately, it is a vindication of the importance of each cultural context and each political scenario.\n\nI think many have felt uncomfortable with all the national-popular experiences. All these populist constructions have unsettled a large part of the conservative sectors, as well as a large part of the left, not only in Latin America.\n\nThis is unfortunate because, on the one hand, it deprives emancipatory thought of a field of applied discussion with which to elucidate questions and test proposals. It is as if these experiences, with all their difficulties, successes and failures, were unworthy of study and debate. On the other hand, it undermines support for a region which is today, objectively, a progressive and democratic pole in global geopolitics.\n\nM.: This \"heretical\" characteristic of the experiences you are talking about is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the existing hostility of the European left towards the progressive governments in South America. For instance, the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration is awfully critical, not to mention Britain's The Guardian and Spain's El Pa\u00eds. I do not know of a single European so-called progressive newspaper that shows what is happening in South America with a minimum objectiveness. When someone asks leftists why they reject these experiences, they say that they are not leftist, but populist. They oppose an allegedly \"good\" left to a \"bad\" left. The good left would be Michelle Bachelet's Chilean socialism, which is by the way very close to European socialism, and the bad left would be the Venezuelan brand, with Brazil and Argentina standing in between the two. It is interesting to see how the Bolivian model, which sparked at first some sympathy for its indigenous, \"exotic\" character, became a part of the \"bad left\" when Evo Morales moved closer to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nTrying to find an explanation for this attitude, I arrived at the conclusion that it has to do with the concept of pluralist democracy as we understand it here, and to the attempt to impose a specific interpretation - that which is currently hegemonic in Europe - as the only legitimate one. The European left cannot accept the legitimacy of democratic institutions that differ from the European ones. In the Democratic paradox, which examines the nature of the Western model of democracy - pluralist democracy -, I describe it as the combination of two different traditions: the tradition of political liberalism, with its idea of the rule of law, of individual freedom and human rights, and the democratic tradition of equality and popular sovereignty. Contrary to those who declare that there is a necessary link between the two, I agree with Canadian philosopher C. B. Macpherson that it is a contingent historical relation, brought about by the joint 19th century struggles of liberals and democrats against absolutism. Thanks to this relation, liberalism was democratized and democracy was liberalized. This is why the ethical-political principles of pluralist liberal democracy are: freedom and equality for all.\n\nNevertheless, this is a contingent relation, and not a necessary co-originality, as Habermas suggests. Carl Schmitt is right when he says that these are two logics, ultimately incompatible, in the sense that perfect freedom and perfect equality can never coexist. According to him, there is thus a contradiction between the liberal and the democratic logic, and this is why he thinks liberal democracy is a nonviable regime. My position is that we should not see this inability for reconciliation as a contradiction, but as \"tension\" - a productive tension, because it creates the space in which pluralism is possible. I believe it is very important that this tension be kept alive, that it should be constantly negotiated and re-negotiated, and that never an element should become totally dominant. But this is what has actually happened with the hegemony of neo-liberalism.\n\nE.: Yes, quite true. You were wondering where the hostility of European progressivism towards the so-called populist experiences in Latin America comes from.\n\nM.: Today, in our post-democratic societies, everything that has to do with democracy, understood as equality and popular sovereignty, has been rejected by the neoliberal hegemony. The popular sovereignty dimension is considered something archaic. This has become such a fundamental part of the common sense of the European left, that it has come to consider democracy simply as elections, a multiparty system and the recognition of human rights.\n\nWhat happened in South America, and what I find interesting in the progressive governments' experience, is that they have reassessed the relation between freedom and equality and they have put popular sovereignty and equality back again at the command post, without doing away with the liberal dimension. And this is why the European left, which thinks that its own post-democratic model is the only legitimate one, when faced with the Latin American models, cries out: this is not democracy, this is populism! Why? Because they have invigorated again the democratic element?\n\nE.: I think that in Latin America this contingent conjunction between liberalism and democracy has never happened, or less so...\n\nM.: It is true. In many cases, there have been liberal governments that were not democratic, and democratic governments that were not liberal, as in Argentina.\n\nE.: Convergence happened there to a lesser extent than in Europe. This is why some of the liberal principles are being used by the traditional elites as a trench against some progress on popular sovereignty, the institutions as trenches against the masses. As if every institution, just for the fact of being one, even if it does not respond to the needs of its people or is undemocratic, should always be preferable to the constituent irruption of the people. Even more, as if a regime could not be, at the same time, popular and republican, in the sense of promoting strong institutions, balance of power and accountability in a pluralist sphere.\n\nThis is surely the challenge of the most advanced state reform processes. But it is impossible to grasp from a liberal paradigm which, after decades of disbelief and cynicism, has come to think that individual liberties are being threatened not by the oligarchic power of a minority, but by the building of new majorities and the comeback of affection and big words in politics. These prejudices always suspect that every collective ideal is totalitarian, and believe that only cynicism provides an antidote. In fact, they tend to empty the people's democracies, and thus to imprint an oligarchic drift to our democratic-liberal political systems.\n\nI personally think that this fear of the popular element - especially when unframed or in its wildest and most ambivalent manifestations -, which is certainly deeply rooted in Europe, could have to do with the fact that we have had some fascist experiences here in the past, and that it is considered that these experiences exhaust all the possibilities of populist phenomena.\n\nOr even worse, that this is their ultimate hidden truth. So, any tendency to identify the nation with the people, crystallized in an emotional identification where leadership plays a role and where there exists a tense relationship with the opposition forces and the existing institutions, would entail a reactionary risk. Even though in other parts of the world they are deployed with an opposite political sign, that of democratization and redistribution of wealth.\n\nThis not only blocks the possibility of thinking about change beyond alternation within the established institutions - and thus a frozen correlation of forces -, but also leaves out a large part of European history, and certainly Latin American too, where the experiences of mass inclusion to the state have a national-popular matrix.\n\nM.: Definitely.\n\nE.: I think there is something of an epistemological colonialism in all of this: \"these are distortions, because pure phenomena are the ones that happen over here\". An intellectually ageing, politically old Europe is looking over the shoulder, let us say offhandedly, at the new experiences of collective will construction and transformation, which are always contradictory, with a lot of problems, many errors, just like all the real experiences, but which are analyzed and underestimated from a standpoint of cynical and colonial arrogance.\n\nM.: It has also a lot to do with the leverage of the neoliberal hegemony and the resulting common sense that has been created: a common sense that understands democracy from a strictly liberal perspective and disqualifies any attempt to question this situation by labeling it as \"populism\".", "Can a nation survive when its founding principle is disconnected from God? It's a question I've been pondering lately with each new poll suggesting America is moving away from its Judeo-Christian roots.\n\nThough it will offend modern sensibilities in our multi-cultural age, I believe the answer is no.\n\nAmerica has been free and tolerant specifically because the founders built the country on a profoundly moral idea, which is captured in the second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nI'll be clear about this: The creator the founders were referencing is the God of the Torah and New Testament.\n\nWhat separates the United States from other countries is that it was founded on an idea -- that our rights are given to us not by the state or by man but by God. This idea has elevated our discourse and been the common thread of social change, from the anti-slavery and civil rights movements to the cause of women's suffrage and efforts to end abortion. All these movements were rooted in the idea of respecting people's worth as endowed by God.\n\nBut that notion is also unique to the Judeo-Christian worldview. Muslims, Buddhists, Atheists don't believe this. One cannot adhere strictly to Islamic law and also uphold the Constitution. Sharia law rejects the freedoms - of conscience, speech, religion, etc. - that flow from this founding principle.\n\nUnlike other faiths, Islam, as it is practiced throughout much of the world, is totalitarian in nature: It is not only a religion but a framework designed to apply to all areas of society -- including government, the law and even the military.\n\nI'm raising all of this because cultural observers, demographers and others have established that America is experiencing a falling away of Judeo-Christian beliefs even as we bring in more people who were never part of this tradition.\n\nA new Pew Research Center report finds that in the next 25 years Islam will overtake Judaism to become America's second leading religion. According to Pew, immigration accounts for roughly half the Muslim population growth, while the other half is due to natural growth from higher birth rates.\n\nA 2013 Pew Research Center report found that while most immigrants are Christian, a \"rising share\" adhere to other faiths, most prominently Islam.\n\nThe report notes that the \"geographic origins [of immigrants] gradually have been shifting\" from Europe and the Americas to Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle-East-North-Africa regions, places where Christianity and Judaism are less common. In fact, according to U.S. government data, a majority (53 percent) of new permanent residents now come from Asia, the Middle East or Africa. That's up from 41 percent in 1992.\n\nThe U.S. grants permanent residency to about one-million immigrants, including 260,000 non- Christians and 140,000 religiously unaffiliated. Pew estimates that between 1992 and 2012, the U.S. admitted 2.8 million religiously unaffiliated immigrants, 1.7 million Muslim immigrants and half a million Hindus. Meanwhile, says Pew, the number of legal Christian immigrants admitted per year has decreased since 2006.\n\nMany immigrants come to America precisely because they are attracted to aspects of the nation that spring from Judeo Christian culture. But it is difficult to see that the nation can survive when those who believe in its founding idea -- that our liberty comes from God -- are no longer a majority of the population\n\nAmerica is exceptional in many ways and for many reasons. But what makes it truly unique is the recognition that absent a belief in God, our liberty may soon fade away.", "GettyIn this handout image provided by the South Korean Presidential Blue House, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye weeps during an address to the nation about the sunken ferry Sewol at the presidential Blue House on May 19, 2014 in Seoul, South Korea\n\nNorth Korea has further inflamed tensions with South Korea by calling its president Park Geun-Hye a \"crazy old b -- -- -- ,\" in an article published in a state-controlled newspaper.\n\nAccording to AFP, an article printed in the North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper also described Park as a \"murderous devil.\"\n\n\"This tailless crazy old b -- -- -- called Park Geun-Hye is heaping further misery on our people, already suffering from the tragedy of division,\" the article read, according to AFP.\n\nThe article was published in response to Park recently describing Kim Jong Un's control over the North as an \"extreme reign of terror.\"\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula were raised last month when the North claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Weeks later the totalitarian regime launched a satellite rocket, interpreted by the rest of the world as a test of a long-range missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n\nAn industrial park that is jointly-run by North and South Korea was shut earlier this month following the satellite launch.\n\nThe park employed over 50,000 North Koreans and had been running since 2004.\n\nSouth Korea claimed last week that Kim Jong Un had ordered preparations to begin for launching \"terror\" attacks on South Korean nationals.\n\nIn televised remarks, senior South Korean presidential official Kim Sung-Woo said North Korea's spy agency has begun work to implement Kim Jong Un's order to \"muster anti-South terror capabilities that can pose a direct threat to our lives and security.\"", "China's recent decision to expand the \"allowance\" of children per family from one to two has in some quarters been mistaken for a softening of the regime toward human rights, in this case the right of families to have children. However, tender pro-family feelings have nothing to do with this action taken by the nation's rulers.\n\nLet's be clear about this: the Chinese government still operates on totalitarian principles, meaning it is a country whose governing class claims the right (and does not hesitate to put that right into practice) to control and regulate all aspects of the lives of its subjects. Perhaps it is becoming less correct to speak of China unqualifiedly as a communist country, given its enormous efforts in recent decades to promote an economy that to some degree operates along profit-making principles and tolerates substantial financial inequality to do so. At the same time, its recent economic successes have rested on essentially the slave labor of prisoners combined with low wages that, as prosperity causes living standards to creep up, are likely to rise enough to price China out of some of the wealthier nations' outsourcing of labor.\n\nIn fact, it is virtually impossible to understand from a Western viewpoint what exactly the Chinese have in mind for their political system, economy, or basic social structure. Nonetheless, clearly the regime's switch after many decades from a \"one child per couple\" policy to one permitting a second child points to something going on that, even if not motivated by sound morality, may have socially healthy repercussions.\n\nOf course, the immediate and primary motivation appears to be the regime's acknowledgement of severe demographic challenges resulting from the radical curtailment of reproduction there. The looming inverted pyramid of large numbers of elderly and small numbers of working-age people that most of the West and, even more dramatically, Japan are beginning to face has much more serious repercussions for China, both because China's population decline will be more dramatic and because, despite its economic clout, its people are still not as prosperous as those in the West. And then there is the problem of the shortage of females, which the \"one child\" years greatly exacerbated. Neither of these problems, however, can be quickly reversed by China's changed policy: Instead, China can anticipate demographic challenges and disequilibrium for the foreseeable future.\n\nFundamentally, children are a gift; healthy societies recognize that, and therefore even moving from one \"permissible\" child to two may be a major game changer for China. If we can put it this way, openness, step by step, to freedom and to the more developed members of the world community offer China its best opportunity for prosperity and for a healthy society. Of course, today's China has far to go to reach the understanding of freedom and individual liberties that have fueled the progress of the Christian-formed West up until recent times. The regime may end up choosing a less tolerant and more aggressive path in pursuit of world power. Please God the Chinese have the wisdom to avoid anything that might develop into a catastrophic world war, for example. If, rather, the Chinese rulers truly want to be a world player, they will need to understand that although world powers become so in many different ways, one requirement is a large and dynamic population. Rather than being a deficit, it is an advantage to developing a prosperous and healthy society.\n\nThose reading this are as appalled as I am by abortion, which is contrary to the natural law and to the teaching of the Church. However, despite China's horrendous record of forced abortions throughout the \"one child\" years and its refusal to repudiate abortion as a means to enforce the new \"two child\" policy, I am optimistic for the future of human rights in China, in part because of the growth of Christianity there. Although Christians still make up only a tiny minority of Chinese, the Church, even under legal constraints and persecution, has shown very rapid growth there, which God willing will continue.\n\nCan we hope that in time the leaders of China will come to see Christianity not as a threat but as a wellspring of national health and perhaps greatness? In the next several years, I believe it is not only possible but even likely that China will to a large extent have become Christian without any persecution, and that it will have distanced itself further from communism, imitating instead the healthy example of a free country in terms of both religion and the marketplace. And I pray that the Chinese will come to recognize all children as a gift, culturally and economically, regardless of the religion they profess. I am even optimistic enough to hope that this realization will return to the nations of the West as well, and that the United States and Europe will abandon a mindset that tolerates abortion and embrace one that cherishes its children.", "AP - The 1991 Gulf War saw only 100 hours of ground fighting as U.S. forces entered Kuwait to end the Iraqi occupation but echoes of that conflict have lingered on for decades in the Mideast.\n\nThe war pushed America into opening military bases in the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, drawing the anger of an upstart militant named Osama bin Laden and laying the groundwork for Al-Qaida attacks leading up to Sept. 11, 2001. Saddam Hussein, demonized as being worse than Adolf Hitler by President George H.W. Bush, would outlast his American rival in power until Bush's son launched the 2003 American-led invasion that toppled the Iraqi dictator.\n\nNow, 25 years after the first U.S. Marines swept across the border into Kuwait, American forces are battling the extremist Islamic State group, born out of Al-Qaida, in the splintered territories of Iraq and Syria. The Arab allies that joined the 1991 coalition are fighting their own conflicts both at home and abroad, as Iran vies for greater regional power following a nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nIn all, the United States finds itself in the quandary it hoped to avoid back in 1991.\n\n\"Had we taken all of Iraq, we would have been like the dinosaur in the tar pit - we would still be there, and we, not the United Nations, would be bearing the costs for that occupation,\" the late U.S. Gen.

Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping crude from a disputed oil field and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion of debt that Iraq had accumulated during its 1980s war with Iran.\n\nFearing Saudi Arabia could be invaded next, U.S. officials moved quickly to deploy troops to the region.

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government...\n\nUS Declaration of Independence\n\nThe United States is going past the stage Claire Wolfe wrote about in 1996:\n\n\"America is at that awkward stage. It's too late to work within the system, but too early to shoot the bastards.\"\n\nI will begin by enumerating several abuses of the Occupation Group that runs what passes for government in Washington DC.\n\n6) Assassination of our leaders. It is extremely difficult to elect an honest man or woman with some intellect who is courageous and outspoken. Then along comes the Israeli and CIA assassination teams to exterminate the first honest politician they can find. Nobody believes Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman who killed President Kennedy. His brother Robert won the California primary. The LAPD and the courts and the news media covered up the fact that Sirhan Sirhan could mot have possibly shot RFK in the back at an upward angle from a distance of no more than 3 inches. Martin Luther King Jr was killed in Memphis one year to the day of his anti-war speech at the Riverside Church in New York. Dr King had intended to go to Washington DC in the summer of 1968 to shut down the town until the Vietnam war was stopped. He was murdered on the first anniversary of that speech as a lesson to tell us that we do not have the right to organize effective resistance to wars that Wall Street and Israel want us to fight. Recently, Supreme court Justice Antonin Scalia died with a pillow over his head. Some say the pillow was left in position as a warning to every judge in America. Matt Drudge was told last year by another Supreme Court Justice that in 2016 America was going under full totalitarian rule. If Bankers use assassinations to cancel whatever good results we get from the political process, then we are not bound by their court rulings, their Executive Orders and their laws.\n\n7) The repeal of the Bill of Rights. There were many people in the original 13 states who wanted a Bill of Rights to defend its citizens from an all powerful central government. Today the Bill of Rights seems to be an almost distant memory. The government collects all of our emails, phone conversations and online posts. They can also copy all sensitive and personal documents from our computers. But that is not enough for them. They have under NDAA passed laws that allow them to arrest, torture and imprison American citizens without trial. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were the original Contract with America. The Occupation Group in Washington DC violated that contract so I am not bound by their illegitimate government nor by anything they say or do.\n\n8) Dictatorial Powers over the Free Press. The First Amendment specifically mentions the Free Press because it is a cornerstone of our democracy. In America six Jewish run companies control 90% of what we see and hear in the media. They make a free exchange of ideas nearly impossible. In 2013 the journalist Michael Hastings said, 'the Obama administration has declared war on investigative journalism... And from this point forward we should no longer as the media cooperate in any manner with the government when we are doing National Security stories.' Hastings was murdered by the FBI a few days later. The TV News shows are selling you to advertizers just as do sports and sitcoms. News advertizers are paying a lot more for media talent than their ratings would justify. Their audience figured out they were lying so we stopped listening. But their wages remain astronomical. The reason for the exceptionally high pay is that their advertizers want you to believe the lies the News sells.\n\n9) The looting of America. Catherine Austin Fitts was US Housing Commissioner in the first Bush administration. She once said she found one block in San Diego that had lost 20 million dollars in HUD guaranteed loans made on properties that never existed and did not even have postal street addresses. On March 22, 2000 Susan Gaffney, Inspector General of Housing and Urban Development, testified before the US House of Representatives that she had to adjust the books 284 times and write off 77.2 billion dollars for the fiscal years 1998 and 1999. A Congressman asked her if she did anything other than adjust the books. She said she did nothing other than adjust the books meaning she did not even try to recover the stolen money. On September 10, 2001 Donald Rumsfeld announced that 2.3 trillion dollars went missing from Defense Department spending. Rumsfeld promised they would do a better job at tracing the missing money by the end of George Bush's second term. Another broken promise. The DOD admitted recently they could not trace $8.5 trillion in Pentagon spending. Why should we bother paying taxes if all they are going to do is steal our money and kill innocent people overseas?\n\n10) Medical experiments on American citizens and exemptions for vaccine makers. PUBLIC LAW 105-85 -- NOV. 18, 1997 111 STAT. 1629 makes it legal for the US government to medically experiment on American citizens without their informed consent. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (public law 99-660) lets vaccine makers add mercury, aluminum and other dangerous substances to vaccines. They can kill and maim children. And you can do nothing about that. Why? Because Big Pharma pays the legislatures to pass insane laws. This law exempting Big Pharma from damages for killing and maiming children, was upheld by a 6 to 2 Supreme Court ruling in 2011. Do I have to obey their vaccine laws and allow them to experiment on me? No.\n\nPS: Retiring generals have received $800,000 per year salaries because the Pentagon allows Drug companies to test experimental vaccines on US troops. Hint to the Uber Rich: I think you have already passed the limit on the number of insufferable offenses you have committed against our Armed Forces. Hint 2: We call soldiers Armed Forces because they have weapons. The Catholic church was very wealthy after the Protestant reformation began but they lost a lot of their wealth. Why? Because they had no soldiers willing to fight and to die defending the Church's property rights.\n\n11) The end of the Rule of Law. The Unthinkable has become a daily occurrence in this Occupied Nation. There was a time when local police could not stop you ,search you, seize the cash in your wallet and keep your money without ever arresting you for a crime. Today the the cops steal more from citizens than do the muggers, armed robbers and burglars. In one case the IRS said a woman who ran a small town diner for more than 30 years was evading US tax and financial reporting laws when she deposited her daily earnings in the bank in cash. The IRS seized all of her money without proof that she broke any laws. One couple had to take out a second mortgage to hire a defense lawyer to protect themselves from an asset seizure. The local cops and the District Attorney seized the money from the loan so the couple would not have a lawyer to defend themselves. Things are so bad that the Canadian government had to issue a travel advisory to its citizens that American cops can ruin your vacation by stealing your cash even though you had never broken any laws.\n\n12) The Transportation Security Administration. They have never caught a terrorist. They have taken bribes to allow drug smugglers through. Their primary purpose is to publicly humiliate us. It is dog training. Allowing strangers to grope my genitals is not a price I am willing to pay so I can fly. The only time I ever had to travel recently have been by car or by train. The TSA has destroyed the tourism industry. States like Hawaii are never going to recover even after this current Depression comes to an end unless airlines take over passenger safety. I refuse to fly until the TSA is grounded.\n\nA few months ago I heard calls from media pundits that Donald Trump should be shot because he is causing too many problems for the elite. Bernie Sanders is being robbed of votes and delegates by Hillary. I do not expect either Hillary or Sanders to win the nomination. Biden or Kerry will likely be forced upon us when Hillary quits the race either due to poor health or to legal problems. I have not heard any more calls for the assassination of Trump. That is likely because someone conveyed the message that Trump's assassination would be the last Insufferable Abuse before the revolution.\n\nIf we are lucky, this is what happens when the Dollar and all other currencies fail. The US government will collapse and the US military will declare martial law. But to get our compliance they will have to arrest the Bankers and seize their assets to fund Debt Cancellation which will stop the Depression. And we will demand the right to bring criminal actions against those who have abused us.\n\nUber Rich be warned: We will not tolerate any more assassinations of elected officials. Your days are numbered.", "WHITEWASHING THE BLACK PANTHERS: A new PBS documentary tries to excuse a murderous and totalitarian cult.\n\nLast month marked the 45th anniversary of the infamous cocktail party that Leonard and Felicia Bernstein held in their Park Ave. duplex to raise money for the Black Panthers, an evening that would be written up by Tom Wolfe in his classic \"Radical Chic\" account.

The country was humiliated after perestroika and people wiped their boots with patriotic feelings. That is to say, the coil was compressed to the extreme. But pride in one's country and love of the Motherland are the most powerful of social emotions. This was especially typical of those authors writing in Russian who woke up as citizens of new countries after the collapse of the empire. For example, master of Russian science fiction Sergei Lukyanenko, in thrall to imperial ideas, began his writing career in Kazakhstan. In February 2014, Lukyanenko banned the translation of his work into Ukrainian and announced he would not visit Ukraine because of Maidan.\n\nTotalitarianism is the most striking, easily comprehensible and, most importantly, historically tried and tested antithesis to Anglo-Saxon and French liberalism. All those who are not happy with the present-day world order, which contains ever less order and ever more impulsive barbarism, have tried to find an alternative [...] The apologias of totalitarianism, Stalinism and Hitlerism (an enemy of western democracies and a failed ally of Stalinism) show that a semblance of freedom of expression has been preserved in Russia\", said Kharkiv authors Dmitry Gordevsky and Yana Botsman, who publish under the pseudonym \"Aleksandr Zorich\", during a round table discussion in\n\nThe \"social demand\" [for these books] is basically dictated by the taste of their target audience and their money-making potential. Adherents of the conspiracy theory whereby \"the hand of the Kremlin\" is behind all of this simply refuse to take into account the fact that in Russia there is a genuine demand for this kind of literature. Unlike the mass media, the book market is not driven by \"social demand\" or tyomniki [pre-packaged news stories prepared by the Kremlin - trans.]. Ministerial grants do exist but they are just a drop in the ocean, and they are generally not given to fiction. Mariya Galina believes that we are witnessing two parallel processes: \"The 'accidental time travellers' represent a commercially successful trend that is being exploited not only by EKSMO and Yauza. By contrast, the novels that depict various versions of wars on Ukrainian territory, which emerged a few years ago, were mostly published by Yauza. Judging by the dynamic of their print runs and the frequent renaming of the series (titles of popular brands tend to endure) they are unlikely to have sold well but the publishers rarely make the figures available.\"\n\nThis is a very active subculture that had previously not been visible to the outside world. It has been generated by the following types of people: former military personnel, \"not soldiers but dreamers\" and the like, people who regularly play (often secret) computer war games, fans of apocalyptic literature, people preparing for a future war and learning to use firearms (99 per cent of these activities are wholly clandestine), plus some significant public figures around whom the rest of them gather (in this case, openly). Oleksandr Zabirko believes that reactionary Russian science fiction has provided the \"heroes of Novorossiya\" with an ideal role model:\n\nWe must not forget that the \"accidental time traveller\" books are not just stories of time travel; they are also accounts of vertical social mobility and the personal reincarnation of a typical loser as an epic hero. These are stories of people such as Arseny Pavlov, aka \"Motorola'\" who, after struggling to make ends meet at a car wash near Rostov, was suddenly transformed into a famous field commander, an invincible warrior against Ukrainian fascists; stories in which ex-bricklayer Pavel Dremov turns into a brave and noble Kozak ataman and leader of the self-proclaimed Soviet Socialist Kozak Republic in the city of Stakhanov.

No one mentioned the need of the EU's unity. Just the other way round, British PM David Cameron stated with satisfaction that he reached an agreement which guarantees Britain's specific position in the EU, Keller writes.\n\nIf Central Europeans want to promote their specific interests, they are criticised for challenging common values and threatened with sanctions. If Britain wants the same, everyone recognises its legitimate interests and does their best to meet them, Keller writes.\n\nBritain's remaining in the EU is in the interest of most EU inhabitants, not for the sake of a few tenths of percent of GDP but for the sake of what biologists call diversity of species, Zbynek Petracek writes in Lidove noviny (LN).\n\nWith Britain's departure, the EU would lose an irreplaceable part of its political culture, a society that has been developing democracy for 800 years now and that, unlike the continent, has never succumbed to totalitarianism and remains vigilant against primitive crowd instincts, Petracek writes.\n\nBritish PM David Cameron keeps in control of the developments preceding the planned British referendum on EU membership. It may look surprising that some British ministers have spoken for British EU departure. However, this can be viewed as controlled opposition, Petracek writes.\n\nWhen the migrant calamity burst out in Germany last year, all German politicians uncritically sided with Chancellor Merkel and her migrant \"welcoming position,\" and afterwards they were surprised by the rise of anti-system parties (AfD) and protest movements (Pegida), Petracek writes.\n\nCameron, for his part, is keeping the core of the debate on the level of his own party, in order not to give ammunition to radicals, Petracek writes.\n\nThe British EU referendum on EU membership, due in June, will be one of the most important world events this year, together with the U.S. presidential election in November, Teodor Marjanovic writes in Hospodarske noviny (HN) and asks how the outcome of the two events would influence the Czech Republic.\n\nAs for the U.S. elections, Czechs can rightfully fear that the leadership of the free world might go to Donald Trump, an ego maniac who believes that he may divide the planet with Vladimir Putin in the \"Yalta style,\" Marjanovic writes.\n\nIn the case of the British referendum, Czechs can fear what would happen if Britain left the EU in June, he says.\n\nAfter all, it is quite evident what would happen. The Czech society would be hit by uncertainty, followed by the political rise of anti-EU populists. Furthermore, the Czech Republic would even more open itself to the \"appetites\" of Russia and possibly also China, Marjanovic writes.\n\nBoth Trump and Brexit would have a direct and long-lasting impact on the Czech Republic, he adds in conclusion.\n\nWritten by: \u010cTK\n\nwww.ctk.cz", "ET SPECIAL:Love visual aspect of news?

Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Desert Storm, wrote in his memoirs.\n\nIraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, angry that the tiny neighbor and the United Arab Emirates had ignored OPEC quotas, which Saddam claimed cost his nation $14 billion. Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping crude from a disputed oil field and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion from Iraq's 1980s war with Iran.\n\nFearing Saudi Arabia could be invaded next, US officials moved quickly to deploy troops to the region. After months of negotiations and warnings, the US launched its assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait on Feb. 24, 1991.\n\nIn purely military and political terms, the first Gulf War marked a tremendous success for a US still haunted by Vietnam. America suffered 148 combat deaths during the entire conflict, while 467 troops were wounded out of the over 500,000 deployed, according to the Defense Department.\n\nIt held together an allied army, its war effort was supported by a number of United Nations resolutions, and the conflict cemented its position as the sole world power following end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nAmerica's Arab allies also footed much of the bill for the $61-billion war, with both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait contributing some $16 billion while the United Arab Emirates offered $4 billion, according to US congressional reports. Japan and Germany together contributed another $16 billion, while South Korea gave $251 million. The US covered the rest.\n\nBut the key players in the Arab world on whom the US relied on during the conflict are long gone.\n\nSaudi King Fahd died in 2005. A popular uprising toppled Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Syria's totalitarian ruler Hafez Assad, a longtime US foe who joined the Gulf War effort to reap billions in aid and diplomatic benefits, died in 2000.\n\nHis son, President Bashar Assad, still clings to power amid a five-year civil war that has killed more than 250,000 people and flooded Europe with those fleeing violence across the region.\n\nIn Israel, the memory of Iraqi Scud missile fire prompted the military tospeed up a missile-defense program that included the development of its Iron Dome rocket-defense system with the help of the Americans.\n\nThen-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, a hard-liner, held back from retaliating at the request of Bush, who feared losing Arab support for the war. Though American aid to Israel exceeds $3 billion a year, relations have been strained over stalled Palestinian peace talks.\n\nYet despite seeing his forces routed from Kuwait, Saddam clung to power and survived an uprising by both Shiites and Kurds following the war. The US and its allies began to patrol a northern and southern no-fly zone to protect the Shiites and the Kurds while Saddam remained a thorn in the inside of American politics for more than a decade.\n\n\"I miscalculated,'' Bush said in a December 1995 interview. ''I thought he'd be gone.''\n\nIt would take President George W. Bush's 2003 invasion to end Saddam's reign, coming amid the US campaign in Afghanistan. In its aftermath, al-Qaida in Iraq would arise and be put down by a US military surge, coupled with the support of Sunni tribesmen.\n\nBut as the US withdrew from Iraq and Baghdad stopped supporting the Sunni tribesmen, the Islamic State group emerged from the ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq and in 2014, took control of about a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria.\n\nToday, the US finds itself mired in a long war feared by Schwarzkopf and others who oversaw Operation Desert Storm. Oil prices, which sparked Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, have dropped to under $30 a barrel from more than $100 in just a year and a half.\n\nThe cause, in part, is the same OPEC overproduction the late dictator Saddam railed against across the splintered Middle East.", "When the euro - the common currency in 19 out of the 28 European Union countries - was created, there was a sense that we had already taken a big step toward economic and ultimately political integration.\n\nAfter all, European economies had to continue a rapprochement and the gap between the rich and the not-so-rich countries was being diminished.\n\nBut today, we can conclude that we were wrong. The reality is a completely different situation and it is one that has been tormenting the European Union during these last couple of months.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many places inside the Union where no one cares about integration. But that's not all. There is also growing hostility toward the European idea and the European Union itself. It is growing dramatically.\n\nOn the economic level, when the euro was introduced, every national government continued to act as though the common currency were a national currency. No institution controlling financial policies was active in reality. As a result, some of the countries in the euro zone - and not just the bloc's southern members - fell deep in economic crisis.\n\nThe reaction of the richest countries was not the creation of a controlling mechanism, but a campaign against the \"lazy and corrupt\" members. It should not come as a surprise now to see a considerable proportion of Europeans asking for the financially weak countries to be placed under irrational rescue programmes. It is no surprise either that there is a growing tendency among some member states to want severe punishment against the weaker members like Greece today.\n\nBut, as we can see, every country, according to its power, can impose conditions on the Union, as we are experiencing now with the United Kingdom. Can we talk today about economic integration to the citizens of Europe? Probably not.\n\nOn the political level, the situation seems to be a lot worse.\n\nAfter the latest EU enlargements during which countries that had experienced a long period of communist totalitarianism joined our European home, we thought that political integration was on the right track. It meant the creation of a huge union - one based on democratic and liberal values in which every citizen would live equally with his or her religious, cultural, national or sexual particularities.\n\nAgain, we were wrong. From the onset of the economic crisis, Europe was divided. Some EU members verbally attacked other members. This resulted in a breeding ground for populist politics.\n\nMainstream newspapers discovered lucrative merchandise in nationalist and populist news by rousing the lowest level of sentiments among their readers. Attacking the poorest countries and especially the European idea became a top-selling daily headline.\n\nAs a result, a considerable portion of EU citizens in many member countries tend to think that less Europe is the best medicine for any ailment.\n\nThere's more. Every state, guided by public opinion polls, presented its own planning and schedule - not taking in consideration what the European Union, as a body, had decided.\n\nOne example is how some EU countries reacted when Brussels imposed sanctions against Russia after the annexation of Crimea.\n\nThe constitution in some countries also became the target of ultraconservative leaders. The freedom of the media came under threat. Some citizens, especially the Roma minority, were condemned to a life in the margins of society. But it was the massive waves of refugees and migrants starting to arrive to Europe in 2014 (first through Italy and then through Greece) that proved just how deep the divisions are in Europe.\n\nXenophobia, nationalism, Islamophobia and racism, as well as Europhobia and homophobia, violently entered our daily life, despite the fact that all of these are alien to our post-war European culture.\n\nSo can we talk about integration today? Should we remain hopeful we will reach the goal in the end? Many of the actions taken, such as that of the summit of the Visegrad Group, have left us wondering. Still, let's hope the EU will know what to do and manage to isolate these negative examples before they spread.\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn+", "The 1991 Gulf War saw only 100 hours of ground fighting as U.S. forces entered Kuwait to end the Iraqi occupation but echoes of that conflict have lingered on for decades in the Mideast.\n\nThe war pushed America into opening military bases in the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia, drawing the anger of an upstart militant named Osama bin Laden and laying the groundwork for al-Qaida attacks leading up to Sept. 11, 2001.

Parliaments are the key.\n\nUkraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. Martin Schulz/Flickr. (CC 2.0 by-nc-nd)\n\nContemporary post-Soviet nations' achievements and setbacks directly coincide with the development of representative parliaments, fair electoral systems and political pluralism. National dialogue and orientation for the public good is supported mainly by the parliaments - at least in those former Soviet countries (fSU) that still have them.\n\nPost-Soviet polities are quite a recent invention. Fabricated out of Soviet totalitarian and post-totalitarian institutions, the 'perestroika' political inventions, and liberal-nationalist experiments of the early 1990's, the development of the newly independent states has been fuelled by a tragic tension between authoritarian and democratic trends since 1991 until the present day.\n\nIn this 25-year-long political drama, post-Soviet presidential institutions have been a cradle for despotic inventions while parliaments (central and local) were busy limiting anti-democratic tendencies and - though with meagre results so far - were able to promote democratic politics.\n\nThe parliamentarian and local self-governance traditions of the late Russian imperial era (1864-1917) ceased to exist during the revolutionary experiments of 1917-1924. Imperial parliamentary processes started from the local self-governance reforms of the 1860's that ended up in the creation of the central imperial parliament in 1906. The February revolution in Saint-Petersburg, the launch of a temporary republican cabinet and preparation of an establishment assembly, the movement of the councils of workers and peasants (Soviets), not to mention the creation of national parliaments in the former imperial provinces (i.e. Tsentralna Rada [Central Council, 1917-18] in Ukraine, or Sfatul \u0162\u0103rii [the Country Counsel] in Moldova 1918) - these are just a few examples of the political creativity of those nations that generated new forms of emancipatory political institutions between Warsaw and Vladivostok.\n\nYet most of them were short-lived. The victory of the Bolsheviks and establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics broke with most of the parliamentary traditions in swift succession, while the emancipatory potential of the Soviets was corrupted by the totalitarian practices of the Bolshevik party.\n\nThe Soviet Union formally preserved its parliaments in the form of the USSR Supreme Council, and republican supreme councils. Yet the elections to these parliaments were a tragicomic imitation of citizens' voting. The supreme councils were a place neither for decision-making nor for debate. They were totally controlled by one party.\n\nHowever, the repetition of certain practices from one generation to another can take an institutional form. In the case of the Soviet parliaments, this was a strange configuration, whose major task was the imitation of public debate and fake representation of constituencies. The Soviet-imitated parliament, having become habituated to the belief that strategic decisions are made by some informal group (whether this is the Politburo, Central Committee of the ruling Party, a group of oligarchs, or a presidential administration) while the formal public space is unworthy of notice. Soviet political culture promoted (and still promotes in many fSU countries) the civic instinct that a parliament is an imitation of due political process.\n\nThis tradition was questioned and somewhat ruined in 1988 when the first free elections took place into the USSR Supreme Council. In the following year the republican parliaments were also elected. These parliaments buried the USSR in 1990-1991 and started a new era of political development oriented towards political pluralism and market economy.\n\nSimultaneous with the democratic parliamentary process, the perestroika era of the USSR also established a new political institute with strong authoritarian potential: a president. The first Soviet president was elected in 1990 by the USSR Supreme Council. It was Mikhail Gorbachev, the Communist Party leader, who proceeded to use legislation to shore up his dominant position through parliament.\n\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union, presidential and parliamentary institutes entered into competition in most post-Soviet countries. The political history of independent Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and/or Ukraine can be described in terms of a long-term conflict between a presidential authoritarian tendency and democratic parliamentarianism.\n\nConversely, in certain moments, the presidents could promote liberal agendas while the parliamentary democratic consensus was being shaped by extreme anti-liberal programmes. An example of the latter is the military subjugation of Russia's Duma by President Yeltsin in 1993. Another example was the struggle (also deploying the use of military force) of Zviad Gamsakhurdia and the Georgian Supreme Council in 1990-92.\n\nBy the beginning of the twenty-first century, post-Soviet regimes in Belarus, Russia and the Ukraine had stabilised after the political and socio-economic crisis of the 1990's. Economic stability brought with it normalised markets and some entrepreneurial successes. But political stability was gained mostly as a result of the parliaments' subjugation at the hands of the presidents.\n\nIn Belarus, President Lukashenko established an undisputed authoritarian regime where the Cabinet and parliament were once again a set of institutions imitating government, whereas the presidential administration informally took the government reins for itself. The Soviet legacy was probably the most influential here in shaping the formal and informal institutional setup. Up until today, both parliamentary culture and political pluralism are almost entirely absent from this country.\n\nIn Russia, the liberal reforms of the 1990's were reversed by the long reign of President Putin. A slow decline of parliamentarianism in 2003-2011 coincided with the degeneration of media freedoms and the fake imitation of party pluralism. With the destruction of NTV's independence, all major mass media fell under the undisputed control of the Kremlin. Political parties controlled by the presidential administration have slowly become the only parliamentarian forces. Political power as it has become concentrated in the so-called 'power parties' has grown to resemble that of the Soviet CPSU.\n\nOther dependent political groupings shaped a 'systemic opposition' that imitated criticism and debate while supporting the president in all of his initiatives. The independent political parties have moved to the margins of the political process. Oligarchic groups, which initially supported political pluralism in the Yeltsin era, have signed off the first Putinist social contract and have been subsequently removed from political decision-making in favour of guaranteed economic stability and property rights. The rest of the population has been slowly entering into the patron-client networks that distribute the oil money. Under such conditions, client-voters were bad citizens, and supported the decrease in civil freedoms.\n\n\"Putin's revolution\" in 2011-13 used the achievements of established authoritarian governance to destroy any remaining liberties. Peaceful association, civic assemblies, political opposition, minimal sectoral media freedoms, the autonomy of local authorities, and the residual rights of the federal lands were all legally devastated. All these decisions were formally endorsed by the Russian Duma.\n\nAn institution imitating parliament, the Duma, turned out to be a space for declaring the most odious political ideas and anti-democratic initiatives: war with neighbours, anti-western propaganda, accusations against liberal NGOs alleged to be foreign agents etc. The quintessence of the parliamentary degeneration in Russia was well expressed by Boris Gryzlov: \"Duma is not a place for discussions!\"\n\nUnlike Belarus and Russia, Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada (Supreme Council) has been an institution that in critical moments in recent history has managed to defend its own independence and the civil liberties of its constituencies. In the last 25 years Ukraine has survived two revolutionary cycles (1991-2004 and 2005-2014), and it was the Rada that twice provided the platform for conflict resolution and the defence of core human rights.\n\nThe aforementioned revolutionary cycles started with the promise of political liberties and economic freedoms in 1992 and 2005. Quite soon the oligarchic groups and presidents started forgetting their promises. In the competition between the financial-political groups (FGP) that controlled major private sector industries, publicly-owned companies and core posts in government, parliament and courts, one group usually took over the presidential post. In the clash of FGPs the public good disappeared soon enough from the political agenda, parliament degenerating fast through the marginalisation of the opposition, and the co-optation of the judiciary into an integral part of the 'power vertical'. With time, presidents promoted the interests of their groups to the extent that they united other oligarchic groups and grassroots protesters against these authoritarian rulers, jointly chasing them down.\n\nAnd at moments of the deepest political crisis, with a totally dysfunctional central government exacerbated by separatist insurgencies in 2004 and 2014, it was the Rada that found a way to save the polity and afford the Ukrainian republic one more chance at a democratic solution.\n\nAfter the Euromaidan, the annexation of Crimea and the most bloody period of the on-going Donbas war (August 2014 - August 2015), parliament remains one of the major factors of Ukraine's democratic reconstruction and a space promising to reinstate public dialogue in a country severely fragmented by war, separatism, and poverty.\n\nAfter relatively free and fair elections in October 2014, the ruling coalition united pro-reform factions with a sufficient number of MPs to alter the constitution, taking critical measures to limit corruption in the public sector. Those reforms that have already been introduced in Ukraine have made government more responsive, as well as bringing order to the dispensing of public services, granting some autonomy to local authorities, and making fair elections possible. The de-centralisation and de-oligarchisation of the justice sector, and implementation of tax reforms are much less successful so far. Yet the parliament is still a place where you can hear different voices and look for a nationwide consensus.\n\nAmong the biggest risks for parliamentarian democracy in Ukraine is the marginalisation of the opposition. Those groups who entered the electoral campaign opposing government in 2014 head none of the parliamentary committees. The leaders of the parliament's opposition groups are under criminal investigation. Basically, the post-Soviet tradition of polymorphous pressure on the opposition is intact and in place in post-Maidan Ukraine.\n\nAnother risk for any functioning parliament in Ukraine is the way the coalition works. Although Ukraine is formally a parliamentary-presidential republic, where coalition is a tool for the oversight of the government, the leaders of the executive branch use it to legalise their initiatives without further discussion. The infamous 'de-communisation' laws were approved in exactly this manner.\n\nIn 2015, too many laws were approved without proper discussion and through simplified procedures. The exclusion of MPs from proper legislative processes and the systemic intervention of the president and the prime minister into parliamentary processes with the aim of limiting discussions resulted in several crises for the coalition, and a stalemate for constitutional reform. Some MPs, groups, and one faction have already abandoned the coalition.\n\nYet, despite the fact that these perverse forms of post-Soviet politics are present in the work of the Ukrainian parliament, the Rada remains the place for debates and for the representation of most of the constituencies of Ukraine.\n\nThere is a more disturbing situation with the parliaments of Central Asia. Here, the post-Soviet controversy between presidents and parliaments was soon resolved through the establishment of despotic regimes. Rulers of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have created isolated authoritarian regimes that combine post-Soviet totalitarian institutions with traditional Central Asian monarchic modes of domination. Kazakhstan and Tajikistan are more open societies and economies, but their authoritarian rules are strict and inflexible.\n\nKyrgyzstan's parliament tells a somewhat different story. A weak link in the chain of Central Asian dictatorships, the Kyrgyz citizens have tried to restore their republic. The Tulip Revolution (2005) triggered an ambivalent process: it opened up an opportunity for the Zhogorku Kenesh (the Kyrgyzstani parliament) to restore its public and representative nature; however, this was swiftly overtaken by tragic civil conflict and attempts to establish authoritarian rule. The parliamentary elections in October 2015 showed that society in Kyrgyzstan enjoys political pluralism, yet this has not so far ensured that Kyrgyzstan joins the ranks of representative democracies. Still, for the future of democracy in post-Soviet Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan plays a critical role: its mild authoritarian pluralism leaves space for the slow strengthening of parliamentary democracy and civil society. These processes may have an emancipatory impact on all neighbouring nations.\n\nTo sum up, 25 years after gaining independence the post-Soviet political geography is now defined by five groups of countries and territories if measured by the effectiveness of their parliaments:\n\nSince the first group of countries has detached itself from the post-Soviet space, their successful experience of introducing EU standards of political life is not applicable for the more than 12 other fSU countries. The future of democracy in the post-Soviet region is fully dependent on the successful reforms of Ukraine and similar countries. The key player in making reforms successful and creating stable support for democratic practices is a parliament.", "I appreciate the concern Bailey Flesner has for fellow voters in Sunday's letter, that they understand what the candidates stand for before casting a vote for president.\n\nBeing a Catholic, I chose to use my religious sources rather than Fox News to learn more about socialism, and there are different kinds.\n\nJoseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, in his book \"Europe: Today and Tomorrow\", says socialism is \"subdivided into two different paths, the totalitarian and the democratic,\" and concluded that \"democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine.\" These teachings can be found in the \"Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church\" which identifies more than a few similarities between Church teachings and Sen. Bernie Sanders' definition of democratic socialism.\n\nFlesner says Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist and then goes on to explain what Totalitarian Socialism is and the devastating effects that system has had on Venezuela. These are not the same thing!\n\nSen. Sanders advocates something more akin to the Nordic model, a social democracy -- a market economy with a strong social welfare component. A healthier, better educated people all working together toward the \"American Dream.\"\n\nI agree with Flesner's closing comments, that this topic is incredibly relevant right now to the upcoming elections and of the importance of being educated on the pros and cons of each candidate and their position on the issues. How can one vote for the right person to hold this office unless they are properly informed?", "To Kill A Mockingbird and The Name of the Rose were novels which challenged the literary taste of a society caught between highfalutin modernism and philistinism\n\nTwo writers, Harper Lee, 89, an American, and Umberto Eco, 84, an Italian, coincidentally passed away on the same day -- February 19. They have one thing in common between them. They wrote sensitive, sophisticated and serious fictional accounts and attained unprecedented fame and success. Their novels, Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, published in 1960, and Eco's The Name of the Rose, published in 1980, sold in millions in many languages. They contradict the general and mistaken assumption of a democratic age that intellectual writings do not work in a mass culture.\n\nThe differences between the two are more apparent. Lee did not write another novel, and she was loath to flaunt her celebrity status that her iconic book brought. She remained a recluse in America's loud and in-your-face public life. The only other work she published was a draft of a novel she wrote but which was returned by the publisher, asking her to change it. The changed version became 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. The earlier book, Go Set A Watchman' came out in 2015, and it was in stark contrast to the hero of the latter version of the book. But the readers were not willing to give up on the latter version. Eco, on the other hand, was flamboyant, enjoyed his fame, wrote many more successful novels, and he wrote a newspaper column on semiotics, a subject about the meanings of symbols, with the panache that only the Italians and the French can bring to their vocation.\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird was a beguiling story of a small girl, her brother and father growing up in the American south with its tense race relations between the whites and the blacks. Atticus Finch, played memorably by Gregory Peck in the film version of the book, the lawyer and father of the narrator Scout, defends a young black man charged with murder when the whole town with its dominant white majority was seething with anger against the blacks. That Atticus Finch was a white liberal no doubt helped in the acceptance of the book by millions of white readers. But this was no easy story to tell. Lee does not resort to any kind of rhetorical ruse. She conveys the unfairness of the dominant white community in a very subdued tone, and this has indeed made the book the conscience-awakener that it had unintentionally become.\n\nThe Name of the Rose was an intellectual teaser, with its interwoven disquisitions on Christian theology where the main plot is about the murder of friars in a medieval monastery so as to prevent them from accessing a book of Aristotle on humour. There is a subversive element here which is not there in Lee's book. In her novel, Lee sets up a straight and unequal contest between the just and the unjust.\n\nEco shows the monastic power structure, and through it the Roman Catholic Church and religious system as such, trying to control ideas and thinking of other people. It is an indirect, even convoluted, challenge to authority with hints of totalitarianism. And Eco conveys his ideas through the genre of a detective novel, with an open nod to Sherlock Holmes and Watson.\n\nThe interesting part about these two writers and these two books is that they do not occupy the cloud-covered peaks of modernist obscurity, but they are somewhere in the middle regions on the Mount of Parnassus, where they stand above the ground no doubt but they remain accessible to the sensible general reader. Lee and Eco are middle brow and they were not apologetic about it.", "Rabat - Australian politician Kirralie Smith proposed today a 10-year hiatus on Muslim immigration, saying that Islamic values are \"not compatible to our democratic values of freedom.\"\n\nThe comments were made in an interview with Sky News, where Smith promoted her new political party, The Australian Liberty Alliance, which counts 'the Islamisation issue' as one of its two key pillars.\n\n\"We need to have an honest debate,\" she said, before claiming that she does not mind offending those of Islamic faith. \"I'm not worried, because I think that there are enough indicators that we have some serious issues already.\"\n\nSmith readily outlined her beliefs on Islamic values, saying, \"Islam is more than a religion, it's a totalitarian ideology with political ideology.\"\n\nCiting fears that Muslims may have trouble in integrating into new communities, she pointed to European countries that have large Islamic communities as one of her main worries, but claimed her party \"does not have a problem with people who want to integrate.\"\n\nOne policy Smith put forward was to force mosques, above any other place of worship, to sign the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in order to open, as she stated that only the Islamic community would \"have a problem with it.\"\n\nShe also put forward the suggestion to ban Muslim immigration to the country for up to ten years.\n\nSmith first hit the headlines through her work in the \"Islam-Critical\" Q society, which last year was sued for claiming that Australian Halal certifiers were \"part of a conspiracy to destroy Western civilisation from within.\"\n\nCoincidentally, a study published by University of South Australia's International Centre for Muslim and non-Muslim Understanding last year showed that factors such as lack of education or employment and old age increased the likelihood of Islamophobic opinions among Australians. Muslims in Australia are also three times more likely to suffer abuse than any other religious group."]}}
