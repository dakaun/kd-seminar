{"Samsung": {"2014-09-15": ["It hasn't been long since Samsung announced the Galaxy Alpha. We had been hearing for quite a few months that the company was working on a smartphone with a metal body, that turned out to be the Galaxy Alpha. Recent reports have suggested that the Alpha isn't the only metal touting device that Samsung will be releasing in fact it is believed to be working on as many as three new handsets built along the same lines. The SM-A500 is said to be one of them.\n\nPurported specifications of the three rumored devices, believed to be carrying model numbers SM-A300, SM-A500 and SM-A700, have been leaked multiple times online. However Samsung is yet to confirm any of these devices.\n\nInitially it was said that the Samsung SM-A500 is going to have a 5-inch 1280\u00d7720 pixel resolution display with a quadcore Snapdragon 400 processor from Qualcomm. 8 megapixel rear and 5 megapixel front cameras were also rumored alongside 16GB of internal storage and a 2,330mAh battery.\n\nSammobile reports today that the company has still not locked down all of the specifications of these new devices, particularly the SM-A500, and that its still making changes to both hardware and software. Now instead of an 8 megapixel rear camera a 13 megapixel rear shooter is being rumored for this device apart from the latest TouchWiz user interface which first debuted on the Galaxy Note 4.\n\nNo changes have been rumored as yet for the other specifications but the possibility exists that Samsung might make some changes if the need arises. These smartphones are reportedly going to be released in the last few months of 2014.", "Microsoft is pushing very hard to make Windows Phone the third most widely used mobile platform behind Android and iOS. In some markets it has already been able to overtake BlackBerry in order to clinch the coveted third position. The company's aim can only be fulfilled if OEMs are actually making and selling devices powered by Windows Phone. One of China's biggest OEMs has decided to give up all plans of making Windows Phone devices for now.\n\nShao Yang, Huawei's consumer business group marketing director told reporters at the company's HQ in Shenzhen, China that while Huawei has developed Windows Phone smartphones in the past it will not be making anymore and instead will focus on Android to counter Apple and Samsung's dominance in the market.\n\n\"For us we think Android is the best choice,\" Yang said, adding that \"the biggest problem is that Windows is not quite easy to develop independently.\"\n\nThis shift in direction comes a few months after Huawei confirmed back in March that it will developing a new smartphone that would dual-boot Android and Windows Phone. Plans for that device have been cancelled.\n\nHuawei isn't just giving up on Windows Phone, the company has also confirmed that it won't be taking a chance on Tizen just yet. Samsung is one of the biggest backers of this nascent operating system.", "There's a growing trend among smartphone manufacturers these days and it deals with the selfie phenomenon. Selfies are very popular and many customers who go out in the market for a new smartphone look for one that has a good front camera, which is why many manufacturers have been coming out with their \"selfie-phones.\" Samsung appears to be doing the same with the Galaxy Grand Prime, photos of which have appeared online today.\n\nRumor has it that the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime is going to have a 5-inch qHD resolution display, a Snapdragon 400 processor from Qualcomm coupled with 1GB of RAM and Android 4.4 KitKat. It is rumored to have an 8 megapixel rear camera with 1080p video capture ability as well as a 5 megapixel front camera.\n\nThat might not seem like much but consider the front camera's improvement over Galaxy Grand Prime's predecessors, which stuck with 2 megapixel front shooters, and it becomes evident which crowed Samsung is targeted with this new device.\n\nDual-SIM functionality with 3G, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi a/b/g/n are all rumored to be onboard this device. MicroSD card support along with 8GB of internal storage has also been rumored. The Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime will reportedly be launched first in Vietnam next month before eventually being introduced in other markets.", "The wait for Apple's new iPhone is finally over, and it seems like they prepared to battle a few startups in the industry for users. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but their latest announcement showed that the iPhone 6 has new capabilities previously offered by third-party apps. From the looks of it, the new iPhone comes with many improvements for user experience. That also means Apple is looking to deepen the service value of the smartphone, something Samsung has been trying to do. Samsung, however, has also added more devices (the Gear and Gear Fit in particular). Apple seems to be rallying the market back towards the iPhone.\n\nBut what does that mean for startups that have launched applications and devices with functions similar to iPhone 6's new capabilities? Will these startups be killed by Apple?\n\nCamera Capabilities\n\nApple announced it will maintain the 8 megapixel resolution of the 5S but it will use a new sensor with even larger pixels than before. It will also use digital image stabilization and dual-LED flash. Apps like Camera Awesome and SmugMug are examples of third-party apps that have focused on stabilization and better quality photos.\n\nApple Pay Mobile Payment\n\nApple announced that they will offer mobile payment service. They integrated an NFC chip in the top of the device to offer payments at supported credit card terminals. Purchases are authenticated through the iPhone 6's TouchID sensor to store sensitive credit card data. Although this won't be available until next month, companies like Paypal, Square and LevelUp will have a giant join the competition in the mobile payment arena.\n\nA New HealthKit\n\nApple's HealthKit's software enables other health and fitness apps to share and integrate their data in one platform. The app is also integrated into the new Apple Watch and could potentially monitor everything from the user's heart rate to his or her chronic conditions. Third-party apps like Fitbit, Nike+ and Withings Scale are the major products in this vertical at the moment. Although Apple will allow these apps at first, will they knock the others off the health-app stage as they move into this market?", "Apple last week unveiled two new models of iPhone: the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. The base iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display, while the iPhone 6 Plus features a whopping 5.5-inch display.\n\nThe displays aren't just bigger, but better. Both are termed Retina HD, with the \"smaller\" iPhone displaying at 1334-by-750 resolution and the iPhone Plus displaying at 1920-by-1080. Both support the full sRGB color standard and feature higher contrast, more brightness, and better white balance. Apple promises deeper blacks and sharper text, with wider-angle viewing, and an improved polarizer for better performance outdoors. Despite rumors suggesting sapphire screens, the screen in both iPhone 6 models is still glass.\n\nBoth models of iPhone 6 are thinner than ever. While the iPhone 5s is 7.6 mm thick and the iPhone 5c is 8.97 mm thick, the iPhone 6 is 6.9 mm thick and even the iPhone 6 Plus is only 7.1 mm thick. The larger screens do make a difference in weight, where the iPhone 5s and 5c weigh in at 112 grams and 132 grams, respectively, but the iPhone 6 is 129 grams and the iPhone 6 Plus is a lot heavier, at 172 grams.\n\nOur own Jeff Carlson, who was present at the event, pocketed both models (with the permission of the patient Apple demo staff) -- and found that they fit into regular jeans pockets, with the iPhone 6 Plus obviously occupying more room. Ars Technica has posted a PDF template of the iPhone 6 Plus that you can print and cut out to see how it feels in your hand; perhaps tape it to some cardboard to get a sense of its pocketability. When Adam did that, he found that while the iPhone 6 Plus fit in his jeans pockets, it dug in uncomfortably when he sat down. Your mileage (and clothing) may vary.\n\nAnother tweak that will be almost shocking to long-time iPhone users is that the Sleep-Wake button, which has always been at the top of the device, has moved to the right edge, above the SIM slot. Apple's reason is to better facilitate one-handed use of the larger cases. The Touch ID fingerprint-sensing Home Button is standard.\n\nBehind the screen is Apple's second-generation 64-bit mobile processor, the A8, which features over 2 billion transistors, making it 25 percent faster than the previous A7, and with 50 percent better graphics performance. Apple also claims that the new A8 is 50 percent more energy efficient. That accounts for the battery life, which equals or outperforms the iPhone 5s for all activity modes. One bonus of the iPhone 6 Plus is even better battery life than on the base iPhone 6. For example, while the iPhone 6 boasts up to 10 hours of LTE browsing, the iPhone 6 Plus lasts up to 12 hours. And while the iPhone 6 claims up to 50 hours of audio playback, the iPhone 6 Plus provides up to 80 hours.\n\nAlongside the A8 is Apple's next-generation motion coprocessor, the M8, which features a barometer to sense air pressure to determine elevation (it might also be useful for weather apps). It can also estimate distances with improved sensors.\n\nAlso welcome are major improvements to the cameras. The iPhone 6's 8 megapixel iSight camera has an f/2.2 aperture, along with a host of new features. Focus Pixels is a new technology that replicates the autofocus capabilities of high-end DSLRs for faster focusing. The camera also has faster and more accurate face detection, auto image stabilization to compensate for motion blur and shakiness, and higher-resolution panoramas of up to 43 megapixels. A unique feature of the iPhone 6 Plus camera is optical image stabilization, which moves the sensor to prevent motion blur in low-light situations.\n\nVideos can be captured at up to 60 frames per second in 1080p resolution, and slow-motion video can be captured at 240 fps in 720p resolution (as well as at 120 fps, which was introduced in the iPhone 5s). Video capture now features continuous autofocus to stay sharp on the subject, and cinematic video stabilization to keep video steady.\n\nBut at heart, the iPhone is still a phone, and the iPhone 6 features more connectivity options than ever. It supports up to 20 LTE bands, the most of any smartphone on the market, and can download data at up to 150 Mbps over LTE. Apple will also offer voice over LTE (VoLTE) where available, which should offer increased voice clarity. It also features 802.11ac to take advantage of Apple's latest AirPort routers, with up to three times more throughput than the 802.11n standard used in the iPhone 5s.\n\nA curious feature of the iPhone 6 Plus is Reachability, which enables one-handed operation (and is similar to a Samsung feature that many Apple pundits mocked). Double-touch the Home button and the screen shifts down, making it more accessible to your thumb. The iPhone 6 Plus also features a special landscape view, which works similarly to landscape view functions on the iPad. For example, in Messages, landscape mode displays your list of conversations on the left and your messages on the right, and the home screen rotates to account for the orientation. The iPhone 6, even with a larger screen than the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, does not gain the orientation additions.\n\nOne software display feature both iPhone models will enjoy is Display Zoom, which will increase the size of content to take advantage of the larger screen sizes. Instead of zooming the entire screen, as the existing accessibility feature does, Display Zoom increases the size of icons and buttons, and also provides larger target areas for tapping. That will be particularly welcome to those of us with aging eyes.\n\nSpeaking of display size, apps will have to be tweaked to take full advantage of the larger screen sizes of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. As with iPhone-only apps on the iPad, apps that aren't adjusted for the larger screens will automatically be scaled up via what Apple called \"desktop-class scaling.\"\n\nFinally, both iPhone 6 models will feature near-field communication (NFC) for the first time, which is a cornerstone of Apple's new Apple Pay system. For more on that, and how it relies on the Touch ID sensor built into both iPhone 6 models, see \"Apple Pay Aims to Disrupt Payment Industry,\" 9 September 2014.\n\nBoth models of the iPhone 6 became available for pre-order on 12 September 2014, and will ship on 19 September 2014. They come in the same colors as the iPhone 5s: gold, silver, and space gray. 16 GB of storage is still standard in the $199 base model of the iPhone 6 for those on a budget. For people who need more space, the 32 GB tier has been eliminated, but the price of the 64 GB model has dropped to $299, and there is at long last a 128 GB model for $399. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $100 more for each tier, starting at $299 for the 16 GB model.\n\n9to5Mac is reporting that the 64 GB and 128 GB models will come with iMovie, GarageBand, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and iTunes U pre-installed; they're available as free downloads for the 16 GB models. We hope they can be deleted, for those who don't use them and want to recover the space.\n\nApple is offering a new set of cases in silicone and leather. The silicone cases will retail for $35 for the regular iPhone 6 and $39 for the iPhone 6 Plus and will come in black, blue, pink, green, white, and red (benefitting the Product(RED) charity). The leather cases will cost $45 and $49 and come in black, soft pink, olive brown, midnight blue, and red (again benefitting Product(RED)).\n\nIf you're not interested in the new iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, you may appreciate lower pricing for the current models, which remain available. When you purchase with a two-year service contract, the iPhone 5s drops to $99 for 16 GB and $149 for 32 GB, and the iPhone 5c is available for free.\n\nAlthough we won't know for sure until we spend some quality time with the iPhone 6, it appears that Apple has once again released a worthwhile update. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus aren't revolutionary -- that's not Apple's goal -- but they offer enough new features to attract those who are in the market for a new iPhone, along with those for whom a larger screen is a must. People who are actively turned off by the larger size of these models can stick with the iPhone 5s and 5c for now; it remains to be seen if Apple will maintain a smaller model in future releases.", "Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle. Although the Lego-like multiplayer game is currently the top paid app for the iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., today's popular hit could be tomorrow's dud. The maker of the much obsessed-over \"Candy Crush Saga,\" for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.\n\nIn addition, the founders of Mojang, the Swedish company behind \"Minecraft,\" aren't staying with Microsoft. That could raise questions about Mojang's ability to create another big hit.\n\nThen again, a big hit was not what co-founder Markus \"Notch\" Persson was after when he created the game, according to a blog post Monday from Mojang and a note from Persson himself on his website.\n\n\"It certainly seems like the founders of 'Minecraft' didn't want to continue forward,\" Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. \"It was something too big for them. 'Minecraft' is best in the hands of somebody who can take it in the direction it needs to go for the user.\"\n\nMicrosoft has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses -- Windows and Office software installed on desktops -- slow down or decline. With \"Minecraft,\" Blau said, Microsoft gains a new type of customer -- mobile players.\n\n\"'Minecraft' is very popular on mobile,\" Blau said. \"It has an audience that wouldn't necessarily think of Microsoft first. The mobile audience is typically Apple and Samsung.\"\n\n\"Minecraft\" is an \"open world\" game in gamer lingo, meaning it has no plot or outlined objectives. Players can explore and create virtual worlds built from blocky 3-D objects -- thus the frequent Lego comparisons.\n\n\"It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea,\" Minecraft's website explains.\n\nBesides iPhones and Android devices, the game is available on Windows, Macs, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft said it will continue to make \"Minecraft\" available on all those platforms after the deal closes, expected this year.\n\nWith an all-ages \"E'' rating, the game has been downloaded 100 million times on personal computers since its debut in 2009, and it's the most popular online game on Microsoft's Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft, which released the first Xbox in 2001, also owns the blockbuster \"Halo\" video game franchise. Unlike \"Halo,\" though, \"Minecraft\" is especially popular with younger gamers whose parents might not be comfortable with them going on wild alien shootouts.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in trying to reach that audience. Activision Blizzard Inc., the maker of the \"Call of Duty\" shooter series, also makes \"Skylanders,\" a kids' video game that's played using toy figures.\n\nNow, it will be Microsoft's job to keep Minecraft's loyal fan base happy. It's something raised any time big, established corporations buy little, much-loved independent companies. It happened when Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and more recently when Amazon.com Inc. agreed to buy Twitch, the online network that lets people watch live and recorded footage of others playing video games.\n\n\"Change is scary, and this is a big change for all of us. It's going to be good though. Everything is going to be OK,\" Owen Hill, Mojang's \"chief word officer,\" wrote in a blog post Monday.\n\n\"Minecraft will continue to evolve, just like it has since the start of development. We don't know specific plans for Minecraft's future yet, but we do know that everyone involved wants the community to grow and become even more amazing than it's ever been,\" he continued.\n\nThe acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division. Besides \"Halo,\" it includes the \"Forza\" racing game. In a statement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that with \"Minecraft,\" Microsoft is getting \"an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft.\"\n\nBlau said it helps that Microsoft knows games.\n\n\"It's got the Xbox,\" he said. \"So overall ... it's a good move and a good fit because they have experience in the game industry.\"", "Since U2 stunned the music world by delivering a surprise album at Apple's iPhone 6 unveiling and making it available to a half-billion iTunes users for free, they've gotten an avalanche of publicity.\n\nBut who's listening to it? The picture started to become more clear when Apple said Monday that 33 million users downloaded or streamed \"Songs of Innocence\" in the first six days of its release. Apple says that's a record, but for U2's manager, Guy Oseary, the numbers weren't really the point: The album will live on in users' iCloud, and the band envisions new listeners accessing it for the first time for years to come.\n\n\"We're quite happy that 7 percent of the planet has this album, and they can enjoy it at their leisure,\" Oseary said.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famers' move was hotly debated within the industry as people tried to assess whether it was another stroke of genius from a band that has been a top-selling juggernaut for decades or a ploy by an aging group trying to make a splash in a landscape that has vastly changed since it released its last album in 2009. Even though that album went platinum, its sales were a bit of a disappointment for the band.\n\nBack then, frontman Bono told The Associated Press, \"We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we (tried to) create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging for people who have grown up on a diet of pop stars.\"\n\nThat diet has gotten even more extreme since then, with album sales continuing to plummet industrywide, singles dominating and streaming services including Spotify and even iTunes helping to diminish the impact of a cohesive art form album.\n\nSo what is U2 trying to achieve with its latest Apple alliance? Oseary said the band achieved one goal: keeping the integrity of \"Songs\" intact by releasing it as an album. As far as U2's larger business goals?\n\n\"I don't expect everyone to get everything now,\" Oseary said. \"Maybe in a few years things will start making sense or they won't. But that's not our job. Our job is to make sure the music is in as many hands as possible. This was an incredible opportunity to do that.\"\n\nU2 joined Jay Z, Beyonce and a growing number of artists who are working out exclusive corporate deals and employing guerrilla ad campaigns rather than moving the album through the typical marketing plan of singles release and slow build to launch date.\n\nLike Jay Z and his Samsung partnership to launch \"Magna Carta ... Holy Grail\" last year, U2 and Interscope Records get handsomely paid -- something that's no longer guaranteed from album sales alone -- and the money comes on up front. Apple continues a high-profile relationship with a longtime business and philanthropic partner, plus earns more credit for innovation. Fans get something for free and those who don't want it can just ignore it.\n\n\"I applaud each of those artists creating a stir and not just falling into a predictable marketing strategy,\" longtime producer and Sony Music Entertainment executive Clive Davis said. \"I think in the case of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z, they had successful results triggering so much extra media attention and coverage because they didn't do things in a formulaic kind of manner.\"\n\nBut there may be penalties to pay later if physical retailers refuse to stock the album, as Target did when Beyonce surprise-dropped her self-titled LP exclusively on iTunes last December for a week (it was still a top-seller worldwide). And there are still lots of questions. Will fans now buy a physical copy, released Oct. 14? Will the band lose some of its cool? Even the unflappable Jay Z suffered backlash when the app he and Samsung used to distribute his album to 1 million customers cataloged user information, and there have already been complaints from some who didn't want a U2 album on their cloud -- even as a gift.\n\nRob Beckham, an agent with William Morris Endeavor Entertainment who handles some of country music's biggest stars, thinks any negatives that might emerge have already been offset. All acts suffer a cooling of interest when their careers reach into the decades, he said, and the trick is to find ways to rekindle interest and build new audiences. A win for U2, for sure, but in some ways he feels the excitement over an innovative move will inspire the industry.\n\n\"People still have to have a passion for the music,\" Beckham said. \"They have to have a passion to buy it, the passion to steal it or the passion to copy it. To me, the best part of this is they're getting new music into the marketplace. I think the hardest part is going to be at some point if record labels are not able to sell music and make money, then you're going to see a lot fewer artists and a lot less music in the marketplace.\"\n\nThere's no question the album's arrival got the meter moving in a year that's been light on buzzy releases. Reports surfaced earlier that the band would not release an album until 2015 after teasing its imminent arrival earlier this year. Now, it will be one of 2014's most memorable musical moments.\n\nOseary declined to release financial details of the deal and said he was not privy to Apple's spending on its advertising campaign. The band is focused on next month's deluxe edition release, which will include four unreleased songs and acoustic versions of album tracks, and he said they're not ready to talk about the forthcoming album \"Songs of Experience\" or speculation that a tour announcement is imminent.\n\nHe encouraged everyone to think differently.\n\n\"I think it's great for music,\" he said. \"Someone right now may have seen this happen and they may decide they want to do something amazing with artwork or with lyrics or something amazing with a video or photos. We don't know what someone else will innovate, but it's great to see something exciting happen and see big companies launch something with new music.\"", "If there's one thing Samsung does consistently great, it's releasing devices with gorgeous, eye-catching displays. The experts at DisplayMate have run the Note 4 through their usual battery of tests and have found that Samsung has once again upped its game when it comes to creating a world-class display.\n\nGALAXY NOTE 4 HANDS-ON: Does Apple's iPhone 6 phablet stand a chance?\n\nWe already know that the Galaxy Note 4 features a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1,440 x 2,560-pixels, but that only tells a fraction of the story. While pixel density is definitely important when it comes to measuring display quality, color accuracy might just as, if not more, important and DisplayMate has found that the Note 4 \"has the most accurate colors... of any smartphone or tablet display that we have ever measured.\"\n\nDisplayMate also found that the Note 4's display had above average ratings for screen reflection and for overall brightness while also delivering a significant 14% improvement to the display's power efficiency compared with the Galaxy Note 3.\n\n\"Based on our extensive lab tests and measurements, the Galaxy Note 4 is the best performing smartphone display that we have ever tested,\" DisplayMate concludes. \"It matches or breaks new records in smartphone display performance for: Highest Absolute Color Accuracy, Highest Screen Resolution, Infinite Contrast Ratio, Highest Peak Brightness, Highest Contrast Rating in Ambient Light, and the smallest Brightness Variation with Viewing Angle.\"", "NEW YORK: Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle.

So far, a lot of the Android Wear devices have been too samey to stand out, so hopefully HTC can offer something different.

Depending on what you're doing it changes function, doubling at times as a notifications bar and at others as a home for media player controls.\n\nDubbed 'super-sexy' by no less an authority than former-liege of leaks Evan Blass (aka @evleaks), the handset also picked up four stars from pretty much every site that spent time with it.\n\nBut in news to sadden anyone piqued by the increasing homogenity of smartphone design, it seems that isn't enough to convince Samsung that the Note Edge could have genuiine mass appeal.\n\nAccording to SIM-free smartphone specialists Clove, the phone is being denied a UK release at launch, which is due in mid-October.\n\nWhether that'll change in time is a moot point, but we'd be very surprised if Samsung opted to grant the phone a release later.\n\nClove stated: \"We've had the unfortunate news from UK distribution that the Galaxy Note Edge will not be coming to the UK at launch.\n\n\"We will be doing our best to source non-UK stock for those that are interested in ordering however.\"\n\nNo reason is given for the decision, but one factor may have been that network support was thin on the ground due to the Note Edge's comparatively high price compared with the standard model.\n\nWeaker-than-expected sales for the S.Korea-only Galaxy Round, which featured an ostensibly game-changing curved screen, may also have meant networks shunned the Note Edge on the grounds it was too unconventional to sell in large numbers.\n\nSource:\n\nClove", "NEW YORK - Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle. Although the Lego-like multiplayer game is currently the top paid app for the iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., today's popular hit could be tomorrow's dud. The maker of the much obsessed-over \"Candy Crush Saga,\" for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.\n\nIn addition, the founders of Mojang, the Swedish company behind \"Minecraft,\" aren't staying with Microsoft. That could raise questions about Mojang's ability to create another big hit.\n\nThen again, a big hit was not what co-founder Markus \"Notch\" Persson was after when he created the game, according to a blog post Monday from Mojang and a note from Persson himself on his website.\n\n\"It certainly seems like the founders of 'Minecraft' didn't want to continue forward,\" Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. \"It was something too big for them. 'Minecraft' is best in the hands of somebody who can take it in the direction it needs to go for the user.\"\n\nMicrosoft has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses -- Windows and Office software installed on desktops -- slow down or decline. With \"Minecraft,\" Blau said, Microsoft gains a new type of customer -- mobile players.\n\n\"'Minecraft' is very popular on mobile,\" Blau said. \"It has an audience that wouldn't necessarily think of Microsoft first. The mobile audience is typically Apple and Samsung.\"\n\n\"Minecraft\" is an \"open world\" game in gamer lingo, meaning it has no plot or outlined objectives. Players can explore and create virtual worlds built from blocky 3-D objects -- thus the frequent Lego comparisons.\n\n\"It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea,\" the website of \"Minecraft\" explains.\n\nBesides iPhones and Android devices, the game is available on Windows, Macs, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft said it will continue to make \"Minecraft\" available on all those platforms after the deal closes, expected this year.\n\nWith an all-ages \"E\" rating, the game has been downloaded 100 million times on personal computers since its debut in 2009, and it's the most popular online game on Microsoft's Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft, which released the first Xbox in 2001, also owns the blockbuster \"Halo\" video game franchise. Unlike \"Halo,\" though, \"Minecraft\" is especially popular with younger gamers whose parents might not be comfortable with them going on wild alien shootouts.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in trying to reach that audience. Activision Blizzard Inc., the maker of the \"Call of Duty\" shooter series, also makes \"Skylanders,\" a kids' video game that's played using toy figures.\n\nNow, it will be Microsoft's job to keep Minecraft's loyal fan base happy. It's something raised any time big, established corporations buy little, much-loved independent companies. It happened when Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and more recently when Amazon.com Inc. agreed to buy Twitch, the online network that lets people watch live and recorded footage of others playing video games.\n\n\"Change is scary, and this is a big change for all of us. It's going to be good though. Everything is going to be OK,\" Owen Hill, Mojang's \"chief word officer,\" wrote in a blog post Monday.\n\n\"Minecraft will continue to evolve, just like it has since the start of development. We don't know specific plans for Minecraft's future yet, but we do know that everyone involved wants the community to grow and become even more amazing than it's ever been,\" he continued.\n\nThe acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division. Besides \"Halo,\" it includes the \"Forza\" racing game. In a statement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that with \"Minecraft,\" Microsoft is getting \"an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft.\"\n\nBlau said it helps that Microsoft knows games.\n\n\"It's got the Xbox,\" he said. \"So overall ... it's a good move and a good fit because they have experience in the game industry.\"", "Since U2 stunned the music world by delivering a surprise album at Apple's iPhone 6 unveiling and making it available to a half-billion iTunes users for free, they've gotten an avalanche of publicity.\n\nBut who's listening to it?

The honours went to innovative production and extraordinary resilience; new ways of engaging audiences and better platforms for traditional transmission. Inevitably, in a World Cup year there was plenty of football, but there was also an award for one of the world's great opera houses.\n\nThe IBC2014 International Honour for Excellence, the highest award IBC presents, went to FIFA TV for its continuing innovation in coverage. The audience was treated to a fascinating video history starting at the very first World Cup in Uruguay in 1930, and covering the highlights and memorable moments of each tournament up to today. There was also a second video, this time projected in 4k, capturing the sights and sounds of this year's tournament in Brazil.\n\nThe award was accepted by Niclas Ericson, director of FIFA TV. \"I am delighted to accept this award on behalf of FIFA,\" he said. \"It also pays a fitting tribute to the dedication of our industry-leading service providers who help us deliver the very best coverage of the FIFA World Cup to football fans all over the world.\n\n\"Together, we are able to make the World Cup a truly global experience for everyone. We look forward to continuing this pioneering work with the broadcast industry as we offer the unique platform of the FIFA World Cup to help drive technology forward.\"\n\nEarlier, Ericson had also collected the IBC2014 Judges' Prize for this year's FIFA World Cup, awarded in particular for its collaborative efforts to introduce new services in multimedia, and production in 4k, 8k and 360? surround video. Representatives of no fewer than 14 companies ?V HBS, Sony, NHK, TV Globo, Telegenic, EVS, Deltatre, Eutelsat, Eurovision EBU, Netco Sports, Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Boxframe, Dolby and Fujinon ?V joined him on stage for the presentation.\n\nIBC presented a Special Award to Wiener Staatsoper ?V the Vienna State Opera ?V for its online service staatsoperlive.com, which provides coverage of as many as 40 live productions a year, to everything from smartphones to 4k Samsung smart TVs, with synchronised second screen services such as subtitles and the score.\n\nThe award was received by the company's director, Dominique Meyer, who said \"For us as an opera house with 150 years of tradition, presenting an art form that looks back on 500 years of history, to be rewarded with one of the most renowned awards in this highly innovative industry is a wonderful acknowledgement. It shows how vivid we are, looking from a glorious past into a promising future.\"\n\nThe prestigious IBC Innovation Awards, which mark successful collaborations between technology providers and users, went to Sky Sports in the UK, Sky News Arabia in the United Arab Emirates, and Turner Sports in the USA. The prize for the best conference paper was awarded to four engineers from Italian national broadcaster RAI for their work on the practical implementation of HD to mobile devices using the emerging DVB-T2 Lite standard.\n\n\"The big theme coming out of IBC this year is about engaging with audiences on every level, providing content everywhere,\" said Michael Crimp, IBC's CEO. \"That is completely reinforced by this year's awards. At the ceremony itself it was fascinating to see how two bodies so completely unlike each other as football's global governing body FIFA and the\n\nVienna State Opera both choose to use the same techniques and technologies to make their broadcast and online audiences feel as close to the event as those who could be there.\"\n\n\"I am proud that IBC can recognise these efforts through our awards.\"\n\nEach of the 10 finalists in the IBC2014 Innovation Awards had already beaten off competition from several hundred other nominations to make it to the shortlist and on stage on Sunday night. In each case the honour went to the broadcaster or service provider who had brought technology companies together to solve real-world challenges.\n\nSky Sports in the UK wanted to make its flagship Monday Night Football show even more dynamic, informative and engaging for its audience. The project required two major graphics companies, ChyronHego and Vizrt together with Motion Analysis Corporation to collaborate on the stunning visuals. It took the first award of the night, for content creation.\n\n\"This award is the culmination of so much hard work by so many teams at Sky and from our technology partners,\" said Mike Ruddell, head of technology at Sky Sports. \"Looking back at early Monday Night Football programmes it is amazing to see how far the technology has come, and just how much richer the experience is for our viewers. What's next?\"\n\nHighly commended in this category were Cumulus Media from the USA and Channel 4 from the UK. Cumulus Media applied IP technologies, and a neat iPad audio mixer, to simplifying the \"radio row\" at red carpet events. Its technology partners were Axia Audio, Broadcast Software International and Telos Systems. Channel 4 was shortlisted for its brilliant app to support its coverage of the Grand National, one of the world's great horse races. Using technology from Civolution, Monterosa and TurfTrax, Horse Tracker gave the viewer the position, the speed, the jumps left to face and much more on each of the 40 horses in the race.\n\nTwo years ago Sky News Arabia was a finalist in the IBC Innovation Awards for its original design and build. This year it took the Innovation Award for Content Management for Project SkyNet, which uses the networked resources of its bureaus around the region to provide business continuity and disaster recovery. Blackmagic, Haivision, Nevion, Vizrt and Zixi provided the technology platform.\n\n\"On behalf of Sky News Arabia, our technology partners, management team and board members, I would like to thank IBC for this prestigious award,\" said Dominic Baillie, the broadcaster's chief technical officer. \"Innovation has been key to the success of this project and at Sky News Arabia it is central to our philosophy.\"\n\nAlso called to the stage were two highly commended projects. New UK broadcaster BT Sport has universally implemented the DPP format (AMWA AS-11 standard) for file-based delivery, using Amberfin technology from Dalet Digital Media. Groupe Media TFO has transformed itself from a small broadcaster to a massive online presence, delivering French language content from Toronto, thanks to its technology partners Adobe, Applied Electronics, EMC Isilon, IPV, Oracle and Signiant.\n\nIn the third category, Turner Sports took the IBC2014 Innovation Award for Content Delivery. Its NBA League Pass gives basketball fans access to every game online, and home and away feeds and commentaries, with dynamic advertising on smart TVs and the web.\n\nWith technology partners Adobe, Akamai, DNF Controls, Elemental, FreeWheel Media and Harmonic, Turner now has a platform that can deliver every game over broadband to any subscriber. That means as many as 30 games a night, or over 800 streams published in real time, giving the subscriber the chance to watch four games simultaneously.\n\nThe highly commended finalists in this category came from India, the UK and Germany. Airtel Digital TV in India now delivers contextual tweets directly onto the subscriber's television screen if they want it, without the need to update its nine million set-top boxes in the field, thanks to technology from BrizzTV Media Labs.\n\nSky Deutschland has unveiled Snap, its online media library for subscribers on a whole range of platforms. It assembled a formidable technology team, including Accedo, Atos, Capgemini, Coeno, Contone, CreateCtrl, Deloitte, Fincons, HP, ID Media, Namestorm, NTT Data, SHS Viveon, Sky Italia, TDS, Wirecard and Weeks.\n\nThe success of the BBC iPlayer meant that it had far outstripped its original headend technology. BBC Future Media, in association with Amazon Web Services, Atos, Codeshop, Elemental and Omnia, created a new content factory which currently published 50,000 hours or 100,000 clips a year for four screens and over 1000 different devices.\n\nThis year's IBC exhibition was the biggest ever, with more than 50,000 square metres of stands and around 1,500 exhibitors. IBC recognises the best of the exhibition stand design in three awards.\n\nVeset took the award for the best use of shell scheme space, the judges commenting on the brilliant lighting panels with clear messaging. Highly commended was Trivis Weather Graphix.\n\nFor free design stands smaller than 100 square meters, it was Tech4home that carried off the award. The use of their product in combination with the stand design caught the judges' eye. Highly commended were Limelight and a stand shared by Digispot and Single Malt Audio.\n\nSony was the winner among the larger free design stands, thanks to its imaginative use of materials and texture, very clear top-down messaging and good integration between the stand and the building.

It announced the two new iPhones, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, and the highly-anticipated watch, simply Apple Watch.\n\nApple covered some of the most intricate details about its upcoming watch in a 10-minute video. It details the design of the watch, the uniqueness of the personalized straps, the UI, and its innovative navigation method dubbed the Digital Crown.\n\nApple certainly isn't the first into the wearables space, not by a long shot. But it does have the reputation of hanging back and letting other companies sort out the idiosyncrasies of new technologies while it meticulously works on what it believes is a more compelling, useful product.\n\nWhether the Apple Watch is as innovative and useful as it claims to be, however, is still up for debate. And it will be until the watch hits shelves in early 2015.\n\nJudging from the keynote, though, Apple got some things right that few other smartwatch makers have so far. Here are some things Android Wear OEMs, Pebble, and other smartwatch makers can learn from the Apple Watch.\n\nBand personalization\n\nI've said it countless times now - smartwatches are the first real fusion of tech and fashion. Some might argue that smartphones are fashion items, and that may be true. But you don't wear smartphones, and you don't worry about whether your strap matches your outfit each day.\n\nThat's a new challenge with smartwatches that few seem to be tackling. In fact, this is the one thing I miss most about my original Pebble.\n\nSwapping out the bands was easy, and I regularly wanted to switch bands to match my style. I had a bright red canvas band, a brown tweed band for more dressy occasions, and I had a steel strap for dress. Pebble Steel took that easy customization away with a proprietary connector that requires a tiny screw driver to swap between a very limited selection of bands.\n\nAnd the Moto 360 I just got in the mail earlier today gives me some pause solely because I'm limited to the gray band that came with the watch. I could order a black strap separately, or I could wait a few months and get a steel band for about $80 - fine. But switching out the bands is not easy.\n\nApple handled this conundrum with style. In typical Apple fashion, it made the connection proprietary, which I'm not exactly fond of, but that isn't the point. There are two buttons on the backside of the watch body which serve as quick release buttons for the strap. Apple designed several different types of bands which come in a swath of colors and styles - for any and all occasions. Apple maintained one of the most important pieces of creating a piece of technology fashion: the ability to effortlessly personalize it regularly.\n\nEven with the original Pebble, constantly changing bands became a chore.\n\nOne size doesn't fit all\n\nShrinking all this technology down also poses another problem: not everyone has the same style preference or body type. With the Moto 360, LG G Watch R, Pebble or Pebble Steel, and the dozens of other watches, you get one size.\n\nBut watches aren't one size fits all. In fact, when we were in Berlin, our friend Nicole Scott of MobileGeeks kept bringing up the question \"Where are the smartwatches for women?\" But it's not just women who have different sized wrists. People come in all shapes and sizes, and few smartwatch OEMs have tackled this issue with grace. Apple, however, introduced 38mm and 42mm cases at the same time.\n\nPebble Steel is probably the closest to a small smartwatch you can find on the market today. It looks dainty on my giant wrist, but then again, not everyone likes its squared design and hard corners.\n\nApple managed to walked a very thin line and deliver a selection of watches which will appeal to a broader demographic.\n\nWatch first\n\nSome smartwatch manufacturers have also lost sight of why people wear watches to begin with: to tell time. At IFA, for instance, Samsung explained in great detail that its new Gear S can stand alone. It has a 3G radio built in and it can answer calls and perform S Voice tasks without the help of a smartphone.\n\nWhile that's cool for a limited subset of users, it misses the point.\n\nThe Apple Watch comes with the promise of always being insanely accurate (within +/- 50ms of the global time standard). It also comes with the ability to heavily customize and personalize the way time is delivered to you.\n\nWe'll save the UI discussions for until after we've had a chance to actually use the Apple Watch, but Apple has definitely put time first.\n\nWalkie-Talkie\n\nDelivering notifications efficiently is the primary purpose of most smartwatches. But Apple wanted to make sure there was a unique way to communicate with friends and family using the Apple Watch.\n\nFrankly, the ability to scribble messages and drawings between two Apple Watches - or Digital Touch as Apple calls it - is a bit silly and probably won't get much use off the sales floor. However, there is a tiny feature embedded in Digital Touch that brings me way back to my childhood days and I imagine it will do the same for you. The Apple Watch comes with a built-in mic and speaker, and you can use them as walkie-talkies to send short sound bites to your friends. Count me in on anything that has walkie-talkie functionality.\n\nMeet me at the tree house at 6:00. Bring water guns and S'mores.\n\nWrist Payments\n\nAmong all the other announcements, Apple introduced something few were expecting: NFC payments. Apple Pay is Apple's take on what Google has been doing with Google Wallet for several years now. But like I always say, it's not about who does it first, it's about who does it better.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see which method works better and more reliably, but there is something the Apple Watch can do that Android Wear can't (or at least that I know of, and definitely not through an official app): make payments. Just like with the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, you can pay for things using the Apple Watch. Double-click the button beneath the Digital Crown and hold the face of your watch near the payment reader. Done and done.\n\nWhat isn't clear is how easy it will be to hold the face of your watch to a payment reader (it doesn't look very comfortable in the above picture), or how fluid this process will go. But always having your watch on your wrist, it certainly makes sense to use it as a digital wallet of sorts.\n\nFrankly, I'm still not sold on the Apple Watch. I'm not a fan of its design and the UI looks ... a little dated and undercooked. I understand it's not a finished product, but it doesn't appeal to me as a consumer who heavily relies on Google and Android. However, I am excited for the extra competition in the space. It's going to force both sides of the wearables equation to step up their game and will bring the industry to new heights. Everyone wins.", "NEW YORK - Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle. Although the Lego-like multiplayer game is currently the top paid app for the iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., today's popular hit could be tomorrow's dud. The maker of the much obsessed-over \"Candy Crush Saga,\" for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.\n\nIn addition, the founders of Mojang, the Swedish company behind \"Minecraft,\" aren't staying with Microsoft. That could raise questions about Mojang's ability to create another big hit.\n\nThen again, a big hit was not what co-founder Markus \"Notch\" Persson was after when he created the game, according to a blog post Monday from Mojang and a note from Persson himself on his website.\n\n\"It certainly seems like the founders of 'Minecraft' didn't want to continue forward,\" Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. \"It was something too big for them. 'Minecraft' is best in the hands of somebody who can take it in the direction it needs to go for the user.\"\n\nMicrosoft has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses - Windows and Office software installed on desktops - slow down or decline. With \"Minecraft,\" Blau said, Microsoft gains a new type of customer - mobile players.\n\n\"'Minecraft' is very popular on mobile,\" Blau said. \"It has an audience that wouldn't necessarily think of Microsoft first. The mobile audience is typically Apple and Samsung.\"\n\n\"Minecraft\" is an \"open world\" game in gamer lingo, meaning it has no plot or outlined objectives. Players can explore and create virtual worlds built from blocky 3-D objects - thus the frequent Lego comparisons.\n\n\"It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea,\" Minecraft's website explains.\n\nBesides iPhones and Android devices, the game is available on Windows, Macs, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft said it will continue to make \"Minecraft\" available on all those platforms after the deal closes, expected this year.\n\nWith an all-ages \"E\" rating, the game has been downloaded 100 million times on personal computers since its debut in 2009, and it's the most popular online game on Microsoft's Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft, which released the first Xbox in 2001, also owns the blockbuster \"Halo\" video game franchise. Unlike \"Halo,\" though, \"Minecraft\" is especially popular with younger gamers whose parents might not be comfortable with them going on wild alien shootouts.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in trying to reach that audience. Activision Blizzard Inc., the maker of the \"Call of Duty\" shooter series, also makes \"Skylanders,\" a kids' video game that's played using toy figures.\n\nNow, it will be Microsoft's job to keep Minecraft's loyal fan base happy. It's something raised any time big, established corporations buy little, much-loved independent companies. It happened when Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and more recently when Amazon.com Inc. agreed to buy Twitch, the online network that lets people watch live and recorded footage of others playing video games.\n\n\"Change is scary, and this is a big change for all of us. It's going to be good though. Everything is going to be OK,\" Owen Hill, Mojang's \"chief word officer,\" wrote in a blog post Monday.\n\n\"Minecraft will continue to evolve, just like it has since the start of development.

But while Motorola addressed certain issues, like screen size and the lack of microSD support, it didn't add LTE connectivity, which would truly set it apart in the entry-level market. Have $300 or more to spend on a smartphone? We'd recommend looking at the Nexus 5, or the OnePlus One if you can actually find one. But for $179.99, the new Moto G still has a lot to offer if you're on a budget.\n\nDesign, Features, and Display\n\nDesign-wise, the second generation Moto G looks almost identical to the original model; it dons the same curved back and rounded-but-angled edges. Otherwise, the front has received a slight facelift, as the speaker and microphone grilles have been replaced with long, horizontal bumpers that look similar to the ones on the Moto X. While the new G's matte plastic back feels fine, if generic, it's not as nice as its predecessor's rubberized, textured plastic back. And it doesn't feel as solid, either; there's a sense of hollowness in the updated version.\n\nThat hollow feeling could have something to do with the new G's size, as the previous model was more compact. Measuring in at 5.57 by 2.78 by 0.43 inches (HWD), the new Moto G is larger yet slightly thinner than the first generation (5.11 by 2.59 by 0.45 inches). It still feels relatively light at 5.25 ounces, which is barely heftier than the first generation's 5.04-ounce weight.\n\nThere's a good reason why the G is slightly bigger and heavier; its display grew a full half-inch, from 4.5 inches to 5, during the course of a year. The display is still 720p and projects a relatively pedestrian 294 pixels per inch, compared with the original Moto G's 329. It's only a 35ppi difference, but the new G isn't quite as crisp when you compare the two side-by-side. Placing it next to the more expensive Nexus 5 and its 445ppi reveals a substantial difference in clarity and sharpness.\n\nMotorola added a microSD card slot behind the easily removable back cover, which adds flexibility to the device, allowing users to expand storage space for multimedia. The back cover is designed to be easily removed, so you can snap on almost any variety of colored backs to add your own flavor of customization. It's a nice touch, but still nothing like the options you get with the new Moto X and Moto Maker.\n\nConnectivity and Call Quality\n\nThe U.S. version of the Moto G is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile's GSM and HSPA+ 21 networks, but it won't connect to T-Mobile's faster HSPA+ 42 network. You'll be able to use the Moto G abroad as long as you connect to carriers using GSM, which many do. Motorola released a CDMA version of the original G that was compatible with Verizon, but there's no confirmation from the company on whether the same will occur for the second generation G.\n\nDisappointingly, Motorola didn't include LTE on the phone, which would truly set it apart in the sub-$200 entry level smartphone market. Hopefully the company will roll out an LTE version out over time, like it did with the original G (for a $20 premium).\n\nVolume through the earpiece was plenty loud during my tests, adding just a slight digital/robotic tone to voices coming through the earpiece. I spoke with a friend while on a very noisy New York City street with a cement truck churning away right next to me, and I could still hear him very clearly. On the other end, he could hear and understand me perfectly well despite my loud surroundings, but he could at least tell that I was outside and in a busy environment.\n\nPerformance, Android, and Camera\n\nThe new Moto G uses exactly the same quad-core, 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 CPU and 1GB of RAM as its predecessor, and benchmark scores were very similar. Real-world performance proved the new Moto G and its aging processor are still up to the task: Asphalt 8 ran quite smoothly with very little lag or choppy gameplay, and it handled multitasking and Web browsing with only a few hints of slowing down.\n\nThankfully, Motorola stuck with a mostly pure Android, which makes for a much cleaner and simple experience compared with the heavy UIs that Samsung, HTC, and LG tend to layer on top of the Android OS. Another benefit of using pure Android is that Moto G users will be first in line along with Nexus device owners for the latest Android updates, including the upcoming Android L. Since it's an unlocked phone, you won't find any carrier bloatware, but you will find a light version of Moto Assist, which figures out when you shouldn't receive notifications or calls. For example, it will turn off notifications during a meeting, or it'll read your new text messages out loud while driving. It's an unobtrusive feature that you may even forget exists because it works well (and because there's no icon to activate it; you turn it on or off in Settings).\n\nThe camera has been upgraded to 8 megapixels, compared with the previous model's meager 5-megapixel shooter, which lets the new G take considerably better pictures. It's a good camera for the sub-$200 range, but it doesn't capture nearly as much detail as cameras on high-end smartphones, like the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S5, or even the high-end-yet-low-price Nexus 5. White balance and colors are decent, but not impressive.", "The HTC Desire 610 offers a modern Android experience for little cash, but you get what you pay for in the form of disappointing display quality.\n\nWith HTC's ill-fated strategy of slimming down its smartphone lineup now a distant memory, the Taiwanese company is back to trotting out a lineup of low and midrange devices to compete with the manufacturing might of Samsung and LG. The HTC Desire 610 fills the low end of the portfolio, coming in at just 99 cents (with two-year contract) on AT&T. It's a decent starter phone that draws elements from HTC's One line, but shortcomings like a lackluster display and oversized bezels put it in inexpensive knockoff territory. A recent price drop to $0.99 for the vastly superior Amazon Fire Phone makes it all the more difficult for the Desire 610 to stand out. If you're looking for something a bit bigger, the $49.99 LG G Vista offers a nice phablet experience on a budget.\n\nDesign, Features, and Call Quality\n\nWith rounded edges and a glossy back, the Desire 610 bears resemblance to the iPhone 5c, while the front-facing speakers and oversized bezels are a nod to the original HTC One. It's an absolute grease and fingerprint magnet, but that's typical of glossy designs. At 5.63 by 2.78 by 0.38 inches (HWD) and 5.04 ounces, the 610 feels too big for its 4.7-inch display -- there's about an inch of bezel and plastic framing the top and bottom of the display, not to mention healthy bezels to the left and right. The Power button is also frustratingly on the top edge of the overly tall phone, and both it and the Volume buttons feel too mushy. A flap on the left covers the microSD and SIM card slots, while a micro USB port sits on the bottom edge.\n\nThe 4.7-inch, 960-by-540-pixel LCD is a big letdown, especially in light of HTC's typically excellent displays. It's not just the low pixel density (234ppi) either -- look slightly off angle and everything begins to either wash out or darken. It's nearly impossible to see even lighting and accurate colors thanks to the atrocious viewing angle here. Contrast also suffers, while maximum brightness leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nHTC's front-facing BoomSound speakers are still pretty solid here, but they don't quite replicate the relative richness you get with the One (M8) or even the larger Desire 816's speakers. They're good by virtue of their position more than anything.\n\nThe Desire 610 connects to AT&T's GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz), UMTS (850/1900/2100MHz), HSPA+ (850/1900/2100MHz), and LTE (Band 2, 4, 5, and 17) networks. Reception and download speeds are in line with what we've come to expect from AT&T's LTE network. Call quality was comparable with the Desire 816, meaning loud volume in the earpiece, but less-than-stellar transmissions through the mic. Voices on the other end of the line were clear and distinct, but my voice sounded a touch muddy. Noise cancellation is about average, struggling with wind buffeting and louder disturbances, but doing a decent job of dampening persistent background noise like the clicking of mechanical keyboards.\n\nThe Desire 610 only supports 802.11b/g/n networks on the crowded, slower 2.4GHz band, which is a bummer. Also onboard are Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, and NFC radios, all of which worked fine in my tests.\n\nPerformance and Android\n\nInside the Desire 610 is a quad-core, 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 SoC with 1GB RAM. It's the same chip powering the vast majority of entry-level and midrange Android smartphones today. Performance is in line with phones like the LG Lucid 3, delivering generally smooth performance for most basic tasks like Web browsing, but choking under heavier loads like graphically intensive games.\n\nSee How We Test Cell Phones\n\nHTC's slimmed-down Sense 6 skin is here, running atop Android 4.4.2. It's more or less identical to what we saw on the Desire 816, complete with BlinkFeed, Zoe, and HTC's custom camera, gallery, and music apps. One notable useful feature that trickles down from the One (M8) is Extreme Power Saving Mode, which pares down connectivity and functionality to core apps to save battery life.\n\nOf the 8GB of internal storage, 3.37GB is available to users out of the box. Our 64GB microSD card worked for expanding storage, but you can't easily move app data to the memory card. Bloatware is a way of life for AT&T devices, and the situation is no different on the Desire 610. Preloads include apps like AT&T Navigator, Wild Tangent Games, and Yellow Pages, all of which are basically useless.\n\nIn a battery rundown test, where we loop a video with Wi-Fi on and screen brightness set to max, the Desire 610 lasted for 7 hours, 31 minutes. That's right in line with the 7 hours, 34 minutes turned in by the Desire 816, which has a larger battery, but also a larger, higher-resolution display.", "The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 release date continues to firm up ahead of the official announcement as another very specific Galaxy Note 4 release date window has emerged ahead of October.\n\nOn September 3rd, Samsung took the stage at its Unpacked 2014 Episode 2 launch event and introduced several new products including the an Apple Watch competitor called Gear S, a new product category with the arrival of the Galaxy Note Edge, and an iPhone 6 Plus competitor dubbed Galaxy Note 4. The Galaxy Note 4 is the company's new flagship Galaxy Note and it will challenge the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for supremacy this fall.\n\nProblem is, we still don't have a specific Galaxy Note 4 release date and with an iPhone 6 release confirmed for Friday, many consumers are starting to get anxious ahead of the announcement.\n\nThe specific Galaxy Note 4 release date remains missing in action but we have seen Samsung's device make some progress behind the scenes as it inches toward the confirmed Galaxy Note 4 release date in October. Recently, we've seen it pass through Bluetooth certifications and the FCC, two bodies that need to look it over before it can be released. The AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Galaxy Note 4 variants have all cruised past the FCC on their way to shelves. However, a specific release date remains uncertain.\n\nIn recent days, we've seen two October release dates pop up. Dutch retailers have pointed to an estimated Galaxy Note 4 release on October 10th. A more recent listing on Amazon points to October 3rd. Neither date is concrete and today, we have another very specific Galaxy Note 4 release window to toss into the hat ahead of Samsung's confirmation.\n\nAccording to UK retailer Clove, the Galaxy Note 4 release date, at least in the United Kingdom, should arrive the week of October 13th. It doesn't call out a specific release date which means that it's expecting it anywhere from October 13th to October 17th. While this applies to the UK, the UK is typically on the front lines of key Samsung releases which means that we could see a global release that week as well. The United Kingdom was among the first to the Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note 3 and the Galaxy S4.\n\nThe retailer also confirms the Galaxy Note 4 price and says that the device can now be ordered for \u00a3479.17 (\u00a3575 inc. VAT). That is for the SIM-free international Galaxy Note 4 variant. Galaxy Note 4 pricing will almost certainly vary depending on retailer, carrier and region so consumers shouldn't invest too much into this pricing yet.\n\nUnfortunately, these details do nothing to confirm the specific Galaxy Note 4 release date itself. Samsung and its carrier partners remain silent about the Galaxy Note 4 release in the U.S and at the moment, it's still not clear as to when the Galaxy Note 4 will arrive on shelves to compete against the iPhone 6, LG G3, and HTC One.\n\nApple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are both set to arrive this Friday which means that they will almost certainly beat the Galaxy Note 4 to shelves in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 4 release date remains out of reach, we do know what to expect from the Galaxy Note 4 specs. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will be loaded up with new features including a new 5.7-inch Quad HD display, Snapdragon 805 processor from Qualcomm, 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabilization, new design that features plastic and metal, 32GB of storage, Android 4.4.4 KitKat, new software, and a brand new S Pen.\n\nIt will replace the Galaxy Note 3 as the company's flagship and join the new Galaxy Note Edge as the company's two large screen smartphone options during the holidays.", "Earlier this month Motorola finally unveiled the new Moto X and put all the rumors to rest regarding the release date, pricing, and features. Now that all the details are clear and the release date is quickly approaching, prospective buyers will want to know exactly what to expect regarding the US release date.\n\nThe Moto X was joined by a new Moto G and the Moto 360 smartwatch, both of which are available today for purchase. However, the flagship Moto X isn't available quite yet, but this weekend Motorola confirmed AT&T is up first.\n\nRead: New Moto X Hands-On\n\nThe new Moto X (rumored as the Moto X+1) release date is later this month, but there is no specific release date in September. However, AT&T just confirmed that pre-orders will start on Tuesday, and more details from others will surely be coming extremely soon. Below are more details regarding the rest of the carriers in the US, and everything you need to know about the new Moto X.\n\nAll the Moto X rumors started in February when Motorola tweeted that a new Moto X successor would arrive later this summer, and since then buyers have been waiting patiently. After the long wait it is finally here, coming to a carrier near you soon, and will be quite the phone loaded with features and customization options.\n\nSummer technically ends around September 22nd, and Motorola confirmed it would be available \"this summer\" so we're expecting Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint to make announcements in the near future. For now though, AT&T is the only one with an official statement. They confirmed pre-orders, but not the release date, not yet at least.\n\nLast week Motorola confirmed major US carriers will have the new Moto X (Moto X+1, Moto X2) in stores and available to buyers this month starting at $99 on contract, or $499 outright. This is a good price considering most flagship phones from Samsung, LG, and Apple retail for at least $599, if not more.\n\nAs stated above, all the details have yet to surface, but we do know some general details as well as multiple rumors that should help clear things up for buyers looking for the new Moto X. You'll be able to get one soon from all carriers, but at the Moto X event on September 4th we saw both AT&T and Verizon units floating around, which were eventually given to all that attended the event.\n\nThis confirms both AT&T and Verizon are to carry the Moto X, and will likely be the first carriers to offer it. AT&T had a short two week exclusive last year, and an even longer exclusive on the MotoMaker.com customization suite which eventually opened up for all carriers. AT&T has already confirmed they're up first again this year, so we can only assume they'll have a week or two exclusive before Verizon joins the fold. Multiple rumors have pegged Verizon's Moto X release for September 25th, but a few leaked images also hint at September 17th for the new Moto X release date.\n\nSo what about the other two major carriers in the US? While we can't be certain of some of the smaller carriers, T-Mobile will likely offer the phone, even though they've yet to make a formal announcement. All major carriers sold it last year, so it makes sense to see the same situation in 2014.\n\nRead: Moto X (2013) vs Original Moto X: 5 Key Differences\n\nHowever, Motorola will also be offering a \"Moto X Pure Edition\" on the 16th that is fully unlocked, and developer friendly. This is a unit that will work with T-Mobile, AT&T, and all other GSM carriers. Which means it won't support Verizon or Sprint, but others can use it as they'd like. Similar to Google Play Edition phones we've seen in the past.\n\nUS Cellular confirmed they'll offer the Moto X to its users as well, sometime before the end of the month. So again, we don't have concrete release dates, but they'll be surfacing sooner rather than later. Possibly after all the iPhone 6 hype dies down after the 19th release date.\n\nThe release date is important, but so are the specs when it has to compete with the Galaxy S5 and iPhone 6. So while these aren't extremely important, here's everything you need to know about the new Moto X, for those interested in the numbers and little details.\n\nSpeaking of the customization we just mentioned above, Motorola went above and beyond for the new Moto X. Last year they shocked the mobile world by offering over 18 different custom colors, accent colors, and eventually wood backs like Bamboo or Walnut wood, but this year they've delivered even more choices. 25 to be exact.\n\nThere are 18 different colors for the back, accent colors (like buttons and speaker grills), four wood backs, and four different leathers to choose from. Custom colors are free but the wood and leather are a $25 premium. Those being bamboo, teak, walnut, and ebony. Then new to the Moto X for 2014 though, is four leathers - natural, cognac, black, and navy - from The Horween Leather Company in Chicago.\n\nMotorola also stated that (for now) only AT&T and Verizon are on board for MotoMaker.com customization suite, but eventually all four major carriers supported the option, including US Cellular and Republic Wireless.\n\nAt this point we're probably looking at a late September launch starting with pre-orders on the 17th from Verizon, and later for the rest of the US carriers. That being said, none have been confirmed except for AT&T, so we'll be sure and update once we learn more details.", "Introduction\n\nThe bulk of Samsung's enterprise SSD offerings focused on the OEM space in the past. Samsung has recently begun to open up their product line to the broader retail market with the release of the 845DC PRO and the 845DC EVO. Both of these SSDs utilize new NAND technologies, 3D V-NAND and 3-bit MLC respectively, that offer tangible benefits for their respective target environments.\n\nWhile the new products sport the latest in NAND technology, the 843 series from Samsung features their tried-and-true 21nm Toggle MLC NAND. The SM843 (reviewed here) is geared for lighter read-centric workloads with 20-30% read/write distributions. The SM843T we are testing today offers robust endurance for workloads with 40-50% read/write distributions. The SM843T expands write endurance up to 1.8 DWPD, an increase over the 1 DWPD provided by the SM843. The SM843T offers up 1,930 TBW of endurance for the 480GB model, and 3,680 TBW for the 960 GB capacity.\n\nAnother differentiator between the two models is the inclusion of Power-Loss Protection (PLP). Power-loss protection in the Samsung SM843T is provided by tantalum capacitors, and Samsung's Sudden Power Off and Recovery (SPOR) technology.\n\nThe SM843T comes in 2.5 and 1.8\" form factors in 120, 240, 480, and 960 GB capacities. The SM843T sports 4k random read speeds of 60,000 IOPS, and 11,000 IOPS for 4k random write. Sequential read is impressive at 500 MB/s, and sequential write speed weighs in at 370 MB/s.\n\nThe SM843T also offers up an endurance increase of up to 5.4 DWPD when overprovisioning the drive to a useable capacity of 100, 200, 400, or 800 GB. This is helpful for users who wish to sacrifice capacity to increase endurance. Samsung also lists an increased 4k random write speed of up to 35,000 IOPS when using the same overprovisioning levels that increase endurance. Providing these specific guidelines for overprovisioning is helpful, and we would like to see other manufacturers follow suit.\n\nThe SSD features a slim 7.5mm chassis, and leverages the three-core MDX controller and 512MB of DDR2 SDRAM. Samsung produces all of the components, which can be a considerable advantage in many aspects. The SM843T features an UBER rating of one per 10E17, and a two-million hour MTBF. The SM843T also offers AES-256 encryption for the security conscious.\n\nThe SM843Tn is currently supplanting the SM843T. The SM843Tn is a newer model with a die revision and similar performance and endurance specifications. The SM843Tn series will not feature a 960GB capacity point. The SM843T will provide the 960 GB model in the near term. The 3D V-NAND SV843 will supplant the 960 GB SM843Tn in the future.\n\nAll of the aforementioned features are rounded off with a five-year warranty. One of Samsung's big focuses with the SM843T is on performance consistency, and it shines through in our performance testing. Let's take a closer look.", "After much speculation, Apple is finally entering the smartwatch arena with a device that comes in two sizes, has a color touchscreen, and has features such as Siri, a heart rate monitor and NFC. On sale early next year, the Apple Watch is easily the most eagerly anticipated device in this category, but how does it compare to our current favorite smartwatch, the Pebble Steel? We examined both wearables using seven criteria to see which holds the early advantage in the battle for your wrist.\n\nEditors' Note: This comparison is based on our Apple Watch hands-on time at the launch event and our full review of the Pebble Steel. We'll update our face-off with a definitive verdict once the Apple Watch is released early next year.\n\nBoth the Apple Watch and the Pebble Steel have squarish displays, but the similarities end there. The Pebble Steel measures 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 inches, but the Apple Watch comes in two sizes: 1.5 inches x 1.65 inches wide. So, the smaller Apple Watch should be about the same size as the Steel.\n\nMORE: Best Smartwatches 2014\n\nThe Steel is offered in two colors (brushed stainless and matte black), and each comes with a stainless steel band and a leather strap. The $150 Pebble, which has a plastic body, comes in one of eight colors: orange, green, blue, pink, red, black, white and gray.\n\nThe Apple Watch will come in four finishes (stainless steel, black stainless steel, anodized aluminum and gold), and will be available with six different straps, which include leather, plastic and stainless steel.\n\nEarly Winner: Apple Watch. More color options, both in the band and the case--as well as two sizes--make this the more stylish choice.\n\nThe Pebble Steel has a Corning Gorilla Glass 2 1.26-inch, 144 x 168-pixel, LED-backlit e-paper display. By comparison, the Apple Watch has a color touchscreen that not only responds to swipes, but also can recognize how hard you press on the display. For instance, pressing with two buttons when communicating with a contact lets you share your heartbeat.\n\nEarly Winner: Apple Watch. Its display is more colorful and vibrant, and it's touch-sensitive.\n\nApps on the Apple Watch are displayed as small circles which radiate out from the center of the display. You can use either your finger or the digital crown on the side of the device to navigate and select icons. The digital crown also lets you zoom in on all sorts of content, from maps to photos.\n\nThe Steel has a simpler but more cumbersome interface: A single menu displays installed apps, notifications, watch faces and alarms, and users navigate by using the three buttons on its right side.\n\nEarly Winner: Draw. The Apple Watch's UI is more engaging and innovative, but the Pebble Steel's is more straightforward and has less of a learning curve.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 3,000 apps available for the Pebble Steel, which include everything from Runkeeper to ESPN to Yelp. Plus, the Pebble works with both Android and iOS devices, whereas the Apple Watch only works with iPhones. However, the Pebble can store only a max of 8 apps and watchfaces at once.\n\nAs it's still in development, the number of apps for the Apple Watch is limited to a handful, but we expect Apple to start boasting about the number of watch apps closer to launch. For now, Apple's own Activity and Exercise apps, as well as its Maps, Music and Remote Camera, look solid.\n\nThe Pebble's most defining feature is that it can be submerged in water up to 165 feet deep before breaking. Apple, on the other hand, packed its Watch with NFC, which will let you pay for things and check into hotel rooms from your wrist. You also get a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer to measure how far you've moved. Also, the Apple Watch has a microphone and speaker, so you can use it with Siri and make calls (if you wish).\n\nIn our testing, we found that the Pebble Steel lasted between 5-7 days on a charge, which is still the best we've seen from any smartwatch. Apple hasn't said how long its Watch would last, which doesn't give us much confidence. Other smartwatches with color displays, such as the Samsung Gear Live and Moto 360, run out of juice after only one day.\n\nEarly Winner: Pebble Steel. If the Apple Watch lasted a week, we would have heard about it.\n\nThe Pebble Steel costs $229, a full $120 less than the starting price for the Apple Watch. Apple has yet to announce pricing for additional bands and models.\n\nEarly Winner: Pebble Steel. The Apple Watch does more, but $349 is a lot to pay for a smartphone accessory.\n\nFor now, the contest between the Apple Watch and the Pebble Steel is a draw. The Steel is less expensive, lasts longer on a charge, works with Android and iOS and has more apps, but the Apple Watch has a snazzier design, better display, and more features.\n\nWe'll have to see how many apps the Apple Watch has at launch, which would tip the scales in its favor. Still, this is a preliminary and cursory look at both devices, and a lot could--and will--change between now and when the Apple Watch is released in early 2015. By that time, Pebble could have its own new device, too.", "Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle.

With Android, depending on what smartphone you purchase, you could be unable to install the latest version of Android just a few months after you purchased your fancy new smartphone, rendering it obsolete.\n\nThis is because apart from Google's Nexus line of smartphones and tablets, built with cooperation from LG and now likely Motorola, the company doesn't play a role on the hardware side of the smartphone equation. Unlike Apple, Google is solely a smartphone software creator.\n\nThis means it's often up to the smartphone's manufacturer when it comes to deciding what phone models have access to the latest Android update, whether it be Samsung, Sony, Asus, Amazon, or various other companies.\n\nOn top of this, certain smartphone carriers, like Rogers, Bell and Telus, sometimes block updates from making their way to specific Android phone models, in order to try to encourage their customers to buy a newer smartphone in order to get access to the latest version of Android. The world of Android is filled with smartphones incompatible with more recent versions of Google's operating system.\n\nAccording to Google's latest statistics, only 24.5 per cent of Android owners are using KitKat, the company's latest operating system. There are a variety of reasons for this, including that many people's Android smartphones might not be powerful enough to run the latest operating system - but the issue mainly comes down to a lack of access to KitKat.\n\nWhile the Apple hasn't released statistics in a little under a year, last December the company revealed 74 per cent of Apple users are running iOS 7, the company's latest version of iOS. There's a significant difference between the number of people using Android's KitKat and those on Apple's iOS 7, and this is one of the biggest issues facing Google's operating system.\n\nApproximately 75 per cent of Android users aren't using the platform's latest operating system. This means they won't have access to the newest Android OS and also won't be able to run more recent apps that are only compatible with recent versions of Android.\n\nThis becomes even more of an issue with lower-end budget Android phones carriers often sell at discounted rates, which are frequently locked to increasingly old versions of Android's operating system.\n\nAndroid operating system segmentation even changes the way developers create apps, limiting their audience and playing to the lowest common denominator when deciding how powerful a smartphone needs to be in order to run the application they're creating.\n\nMany Android smartphone manufacturers also \"skin\" Google's operating system, adding their own features, look and permanently installed apps to the platform. Some of these features are often great and very useful. For example the multi-tasking ability Samsung added to Android is useful, but other features are frustrating and only complicate the Android experience, often slowing down the user's smartphone to a crawl.\n\nIf you've purchased a bloatware-filled phone or tablet, the only way around this issue it to hack the Android device by \"rooting\" it. People who root their Android devices often install custom operating systems like Cyanogen Mod, although the process of installing a custom OS and rooting an Android device is complicated and varies between smartphone manufacturers and operating systems.\n\nPurchasing a Nexus or an upcoming Google Silver branded smartphone from another manufacturer, is really the only way to avoid this issue. These \"vanilla Android devices\" remove the burden of having to worry about whether or not Google will push its latest update out to your Android smartphone, but this issue is something many Android users likely aren't aware of.\n\nThe same can be said about Google's Android marketplace and the company's open nature to policing its app store. Almost anything can make it to the Google Play Store, regardless of how poorly the app operates and whether or not it drains your smartphone's precious battery life and data.\n\nThere are a variety of great Android apps, some exclusive to the platform, but there is also a wash of horrible applications that don't work very well, and because of how Google positions Android, they don't have to do anything about this and actually can't, given Android is an open operating system.\n\nIn Apple world, the company approves every single application before it's released on the iOS App store. This means that at the very least Apple users know the app they're downloading won't ruin their experience with the iPhone or iPad. On the downside, a more closed approach to managing apps also means popular Android applications like emulators won't get released on Apple devices, so there are a few drawbacks to Apple's gated technology.\n\nAndroid devices are great and build-quality, one of the deciding factors between Android and iOS for years, is slowly becoming less of an issue as higher-end premium Android devices like the HTC One M8 are released. But in many ways Android's biggest enemy is actually itself.\n\nThere's also no clear solution to this issue given the open nature of Google's Android operating system and this is far from a new problem, segmentation has been the main issue holding Android back since it was launched back in 2008.", "CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nRelated: Microsoft to buy Minecraft maker for $2.5 billion\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "As the amount of data companies are interested in collecting grows, life becomes all the more difficult for IT staff at all levels within an organization. SAS Enterprise storage devices that were once considered giants are now being phased out in favor of SSD Arrays with features such as de-duplication, tape storage has pretty much been abandoned and the same goes without saying for database engines.\n\nFor many customers just storing data is not enough because of the CAPEX and OPEX that is involved, smarter ways of storing the same data are required and since databases generally account for the greatest portion of storage requirements across an application stack. Lately they are used not only for storing data but also for storing logs in many cases. IT managers, developers and system administrators very often turn to the DBA and pose the time old question \"is there a way we can cut down on the space the database is taking up?\" and this question seems to be asked all the more frequently as time goes by.\n\nThis is a dilemma that cannot easily be solved for a MySQL DBA. What would the best way to resolve this issue be? Should I cut down on binary logging? Hmm... I need the binary logs in case I need to track down the transactions that have been executed and perform point in time recovery. Perhaps I should have a look at archiving data to disk and then compress this using tar and gzip? Heck if I do that I'll have to manage and track multiple files and perform countless imports to re-generate the dataset when a report is needed from historical data. Maybe, just maybe, I should look into compressing the data files? This seems like a good idea... that way I can keep all my data, and I can just take advantage of a few extra CPU cycles to keep my data to a reasonable size - or does it?\n\nInspired by the time old dilemma I decided to take the latest version of TokuDB for test run and compare it to InnoDB compression which has been around a while. Both technologies promise a great reduction in disk usage and even performance benefits - naturally if data resides on a smaller portion of the disk access time and seek time will decrease, however this isn't applicable to SSD disks that are generally used in the industry today. So I put together a test system using an HP Gen8 Proliant Server with 4x Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae E3 Processors, 4GB ECC RAM & the Samsung EVO SATA III SSD rated at 6G/s and installed the latest version of Ubuntu 14.04 to run some benchmarks. I used the standard innodb-heavy configuration from the support-files directory adding one change - innodb_file_per_table = ON. The reason for this is that TokuDB will not compress the shared tablespace hence this would affect the results of the benchmarks. To be objective I ran the benchmarks both on MySQL and MariaDB using 5.5.38 which is the latest bundled version for TokuDB.\n\nThe databases were benchmarked for speed and also for the space consumed by the tpcc-mysql dataset generated with 20 warehouses. So lets first have a look at how much space was needed by TokuDB vs. InnoDB (using both compressed and uncompressed tables):\n\nConfiguration GB TokuDB 2,7 InnoDB Compressed Tables 4,2 InnoDB Regular Tables 4,8\n\nTokuDB was a clear winner here, of course the space savings depend on the type of data stored in the database however with the same dataset it seems TokuDB is in the lead. Seeing such a gain in storage requirements of course will make you wonder how much overhead is incurred in reading and writing this data, so lets have a look at the \"tpm-C\" to understand how many orders can be processed per minute on each. Here I have also included results for MariaDB vs. MySQL. The first graph shows the amount of orders that were processed per 10 second interval and the second graph shows the total \"tpm-C\" after the tests were run for 120 seconds:\n\nFigure 1 - Orders processed @ 10 sec interval\n\nInterval MariaDB 5.5.38 MariaDB 5.5.38 InnoDB Compressed TokuDB on MariaDB 5.5.38 MySQL 5.5.38 MySQL 5.5.38 InnoDB Compressed TokuDB on MySQL 5.5.38 10 5300 529 5140 5667 83 5477 20 5743 590 5112 5513 767 5935 30 5322 596 4784 5267 792 5931 40 4536 616 4215 5627 774 6107 50 5206 724 5472 5770 489 6020 60 5827 584 5527 5956 402 6211 70 5588 464 5450 6061 761 5999 80 5679 424 5474 5775 789 6029 90 5759 649 5490 6258 788 5998 100 5288 611 5584 6044 765 6026 110 4637 575 4948 5753 720 5314 120 3696 512 4459 930 472 292\n\nFigure 2 - \"tpm-C\" for 120 test run\n\nMySQL Edition \"tpm-C\" TokuDB on MySQL 5.5.38 32669.5 MySQL 5.5.38 32310.5 MariaDB 5.5.38 31290.5 TokuDB on MariaDB 5.5.38 30827.5 MySQL 5.5.38 InnoDB Compressed Tables 4151 MariaDB 5.5.38 InnoDB Compressed Tables 3437\n\nSurprisingly enough however, the InnoDB table compression results were very low - perhaps this may have shown better results on regular SAS / SATA disks with traditional rotating disks. The impact on performance was incredibly high and the savings on disk space were marginal compared to those of TokuDB so once again again it seems we have a clear winner! TokuDB on MySQL outperformed both MySQL and MariaDB with uncompressed tables. The findings are interesting because in previous benchmarks for older versions of MariaDB and MySQL, MariaDB would generally outperform MySQL however there are many factors should be considered.\n\nThese tests were performed on Ubuntu 14.04 while the previous tests I mentioned were performed on CentOS 6.5 and also the hardware was slightly different (Corsair SSD 128GB vs. Samsung EVO 256GB). Please keep in mind these benchmarks reflect the performance on a specific configurations and there are many factors that should be considered when choosing the MySQL / MariaDB edition to use in production.\n\nAs per this benchmark, the results for TokuDB were nothing less than impressive and it will be very interesting to see the results on the newer versions of MySQL (5.6) and MariaDB (10)!", "Stanford and Duke Universities will use Apple's HealthKit in medical trials, according to a Reuters report.\n\nDoctors at Stanford are working with Apple to let physicians track blood sugar levels for children with diabetes, while Duke is developing a pilot program to track blood pressure, weight and other measurements for patients with cancer or heart disease, Reuters said.\n\nThe hospitals are expected to roll out the programs in a few weeks.\n\n\"Mobile devices can increase healthcare effectiveness and lower healthcare costs,\" Ezra Gottheil, a principal analyst at Technology Business Research, told TechNewsWorld. \"Leaving aside the fancy stuff like diagnosis and early warning, just improving medication compliance could contribute significantly.\"\n\nApple previously announced that Duke and Stanford would be using the MyChart app from Epic, one of its partners.\n\nStanford reportedly has selected children with Type 1 diabetes to participate in its initial trial; it hopes to extend the pilot to teens and infants.\n\nMeasurements of the children's glucose levels will be taken using equipment from DexCom, Reuters reported. Those measurements will be transmitted to iPod touch devices sent home with the children for the trial.\n\nData can be uploaded into Epic's \"MyChart\" application, and healthcare providers will be able to access the data through HealthKit.\n\nDuke reportedly is looking into automatic uploading of patient monitoring data to eliminate mistakes made by manual reporting.\n\nType 1 diabetes projects make up more than 40 percent of the American Diabetes Association's research, although it accounts for only 5 percent of diabetics.\n\nFormerly known as \"juvenile diabetes,\" this variant of the disease usually is diagnosed in children and young adults.\n\n\"Apple appears ready to transform healthcare, a complex and fragmented industry, [and] slowest to technology adoption,\" Harry Wang, a research director at Parks Associates, told TechNewsWorld.\n\nThe connected health market, based on Parks' narrow focus encompassing specific health applications and services, \"will be US$30 billion in five years in the United States alone,\" he said.\n\nNearly 100 million wearable remote patient monitoring devices will ship over the next five years, ABI Research predicted.

And ironically, the designers behind it were trying to sell customers on something it had helped make somewhat redundant.\n\nWhat does make sense though about the Apple Watch is the Apple's courtship of the fashion crowd. If the tech brand wants to make an item people that's part of people's everyday wardrobe, it needs to look good. And elsewhere last week competitor tech companies were taking their relationships with fashion even further. At Diesel Black Gold the brand debuted a collaboration with Samsung Gear S wearables in different shapes, colors and details, \"inspired by highly stylized New Wave rock stars and tough rockabilly heroines.\" Rebecca Minkoff released a five-piece tech range in collaboration with Case-Mate. On Thursday Christian Siriano and Verizon will unveil a \"social imprint\" garment which tracks the social conversation around music and fashion to create a graphic motif on the fabric.\n\nBut other designers were less concerned with trying to conceal LED lights and USB ports with monogrammed wristbands, and more with answering a different question: \"Does this look awesome?\"\n\nWith the spawn of tech and fashion often falling into the luxury category, want is a no less legitimate consideration than whether it'll make our lives easier.\n\nOn the first day of New York Fashion Week CuteCircuit, the brand behind Katy Perry's LED Met Gala dress, showed skirts, dresses, bags, and pantsuits that could be programmed with different patterns and designs via the brand's own app. Not only does this give you an iTunes library of wardrobe options, but also caters to the increasingly growing number of people dedicated to building a uniform wardrobe, or what fashion people call \"investment pieces.\" However you want to look at it, it's helping signify the end of fast fashion, environmental destruction, and sweatshops.\n\nOne brand we've had our eye on for a while is Bushwick designer and NYFW feather ruffler Becca McCharen's Chromat. McCharen frequently works with LED and programmable, wearable tech. For her Spring 2015 show, she teamed up with two equally future-focused brands: Misfit Wearables, and Sydney Rogers of SYRO handbags. Health trackers were actually embedded into some of the pieces, while models carried Rogers' tote bags displaying iPads programmed with the looping graphics.\n\nSydney Rogers also makes quilted chain handbags that display iPad screens. Tell us this digital jab at Jeremy Scott isn't worth a thousand Kate Moss #TBTs?\n\nSamsung also hosted a fashion x wearable tech panel at the Park Hyatt last Sunday, which we attended along with Vanessa Friedman and Suzy Menkes (in the crowd) and Carine Roitfeld and Stephen Gan (on the stage.) The most amusing part was when Roitfeld basically told Samsung's Howard Nuk that his Gear S smartwatch was ugly. Sorry, \"not chic.\" \"The problem with technology is it's a bit cold,\" she explained. \"It's a bit sharp.\"\n\nPerhaps, for wearable tech to succeed, designers have to think about aesthetic value even before function. I'm not saying Roitfeld would describe a Tweet-displaying minidress as \"chic,\" but I'd love to get her opinion on a SYRO iPad tote.", "The rap battle royale of the year took over Sleep Country Amphitheater this Saturday, and everybody won.\n\nWhen two of the biggest names in modern rap history embark on a cross-country stadium tour together, one of two things will happen. I know this because it's only happened twice. It will either be lavishly indulgent like Kanye West and Jay Z's 2011 \"Watch The Throne\" tour or playfully humanizing like Lil' Wayne and Drake's battle royale that transfixed the Sleep Country Amphitheatre audience Saturday night.\n\nNow, I know how ridiculous that sounds -- the self-proclaimed \"greatest rapper alive\" and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, rap's messiah, actually appearing candid for once, but that's why it works -- that's the brilliance behind the corny, Street Fighter-era cartoon skits incorporates in the set. Anytime Wayne hits the stage, powerful and adrenaline-inducing as ever, Drake's right behind him, primed to crack jokes in attempts to diminish Wayne's undeniable prowess. He's the little brother encroaching on his elder's heels. And vice-versa: when Drake floats through his latest radio hit with the Toronto skyline proudly displayed behind him, Wayne's there to quip at his teen drama days on Degrassi, calling him Jimmy, or boasting \"I've been doing this shit since he was in the wheelchair.\"\n\nNobody gets to play the role of wildly acclaimed, internationally revered rap god -- shoes both of them can rightfully fill -- because one is always there to humiliate the other. They humble one another on stage. It's charming, and downright rare for a stadium rap show.\n\nThe show began as the lights dimmed and smoke engulfed the crowd. The jumbotron behind the stage showed a boy putting quarters into an old arcade game and pressing play. Then the narrator introduced the history, \"Our story begins, thousands of years ago, with a legendary tournament, fought through the centuries by the greatest performers in the world. The cost of winning holds great. The sacrifice is many. But the prize is far more valuable than any mere object. The prize is immortality.\"\n\nThe screen then asked us to take out our phones, open the Drake vs. Lil' Wayne application, and button mash on our favorite rapper's cartoon image to decide who will hit the stage first. The whole intro graphic and back-story is tacky, but it kept the crowd engaged and interacting with the performers. It gave everyone (well, everyone with a smartphone) some agency. While most stadium crowds are at the complete mercy of their performer, Drake and Lil' Wayne allowed their fans to play an active role. And, honestly, in a music world where pop artists are increasingly teaming with corporate sponsors and creating digital components to their artwork, the Drake vs. Wayne Street Fighter app is goofy and unthreatening in comparison to Jay Z's tawdry Samsung deal or U2's recent Apple association.\n\nWayne won the pre-performance battle and rose from below the stage first, muscling through \"Blunt Blowin'\" and \"John,\" two stand-outs from 2011's Tha Carter IV. And then, without hesitation, the intro beat to the Lauryn Hill-sampled \"Draft Day\" blasted, and the 27-year-old Canadian Drake draped in a Marcus Mariota Oregon Ducks jersey -- the first of two he'd wear throughout the night -- grabbed the mic. The back-and-forth was seamless: as a Drake hit ended a Wayne hit started, and the only reminder that they were battling was a light-hearted jab or two in passing.\n\nAs the weathered veteran of the two, Wayne comfortably gloated, \"I can do something he can't: take it back.\" And Drake couldn't rebut, because Weezy's catalogue of classics reach back over a decade. He can tap into his bag of mixtape jams like \"Swag Surf\" or, simply, exploit his 2008 magnum opus Tha Carter III, firing out \"A Milli,\" \"Mr. Carter,\" \"Mrs. Officer,\" and \"Lollipop.\"\n\nDrake, of course, can pull from his high-quality discographer too, but even timelier are his singles. Since his latest, Nothing Was The Same, was released a year ago this month, Drake has posted \"Trophies,\" \"0-100,\" and \"Draft Day\" on his octobersveryown Soundcloud page, as well as traded verses with Soulja Boy on \"We Made It.\"\n\nThe two YMCMB rappers compliment each other's style surprisingly well. Drake's presence and music is infectious: it makes you want to dance, to make eye contact and smile at the stranger standing next to you. He's on stage partying with you, seemingly as thrilled to play his hits as you are to hear them. Comparably Lil' Wayne is the rock star. He's there to floor the crowd, to render you speechless as you gawk in awe as he cavorts around the stage.\n\nAbout half way through the set the duo started showing up on stage during each other's songs. It was after Drake levitated above the crowd on a \"stripper pole,\" as Lil' Wayne affectionately called it, that their relationship was aptly represented. The stunt, though, is so quintessential Drake, as he didn't rap while suspended above his cronies, rather, he gazed into the crowd of hypebeasts and hip-hop heads, shouting out specific concertgoers by their shirt color, or hat brand, or any worthy signifier. All that to intro into his blush-inducing crooner \"Hold On, We're Going Home,\" which Wayne stole by imitating Drake's falsetto, earning him a worthy, \"y'all better make some mother-f*ckin' noise for this angelic-sounding ass,\" from Drizzy himself. It was the perfect signifier of their relationship: brotherly, competitive, and ultimately blithe.\n\nThe concert's finale came when both rappers ran through a slew of their joint chart toppers. It started with the duo trading boastful verses on Drake's \"The Motto.\" Then \"Believe Me,\" the lead single off Wayne's forthcoming album Tha Carter V (slated for October 28), in which Drake declares, \"It's been me and Young Tune off the rip/that's the man who put me in this shit.\" It's a line that shines through the whole performance, because between all the digs and quips, Drake is forever indebted to Wayne for helping him jumpstart his career on Young Money Entertainment. The final installment of their collaborative set comes in \"HYFR,\" a 2013 Grammy nominee for Best Rap Performance, which has both spitters at the top of their game, weaving between one another's lyrical acrobatics.\n\nAccording to the scoreboard, Wayne \"technically\" won Portland, the 13th round of their 31-city, two-month-long bout, but they both conceded that neither truly wins a battle. Their partnership is duly dependent on one another as Drake owes Lil' Wayne for his come-up but Wayne now owes Drake for his sustained relevance. So in reality, as cheesy as the root of their \"battle\" is, at the Drake vs. Lil' Wayne tour everybody wins.", "South Korean forces have installed a team of robots along the border with North Korea.\n\nThe machine-gun wielding robots, built by a subsidiary of Samsung, have heat and motion detectors to identify potential targets more than 2 miles away.\n\nThe SGR-1 has a 5.5mm machine gun and a 40mm grenade launcher - although needs a human operator to give it the go ahead to fire.\n\n'Human soldiers can easily fall asleep or allow for the depreciation of their concentration over time,' Samsung Techwin spokesman Huh Kwang-hak said at the time.\n\n'But these robots have automatic surveillance, which doesn't leave room for anything resembling human laziness.\n\n'They also won't have any fear (of) enemy attackers on the front lines.'\n\n'The SGR-1 can and will prevent wars.'\n\nThe robots work side-by-side with soldiers in the Demilitarised Zone (referred to as the 'DMZ'), the 160 mile long, 2.5-mile wide strip of land separating South Korea from North Korea.\n\nIt is believed each unit costs $200,000 - although it has not been revealed how many are in use.\n\nWhen it detects a potential threat, it notifies the command centre.\n\nThe operator can then use the robot's video and audio devices to communicate remotely before deciding to open fire.", "Samsung has demanded an investigation after it accused senior executives at LG Electronics of deliberately \"destroying\" high-end washing machines at stores in Germany. The company claims its rival vandalised machines in Berlin, with one of the alleged incidents taking place before the massive IFA consumer electronics show earlier this month. \"The people in question have been implicated in deliberately destroying Samsung washing machines displayed at retail stores in Berlin, Germany,\" said a statement from the company. Samsung has asked the prosecutor's office in Seoul to investiga...", "Technology is an ever changing, always evolving thing. There are new technologies coming out every year and there is always something on the brink of becoming mainstream. Take the smartwatch for instance. Two years ago it was a prototype and now there will be at least four different high quality smartwatches by the end of 2014. Let's take a look at other new technologies that are about to become mainstream soon.\n\nWe've seen this already a little bit with Google Glass but that's just the beginning. Despite getting a lot of press and controversy, Google Glass is a very young product. In fact, all the pairs that are out now are beta test units. Sometime in the next couple of years Google will be releasing a consumer level version for a much cheaper price. It's also very likely that there will be competitors releasing smart glasses right alongside Google Glass. There will be some who don't like it at first but eventually the kinks will be worked out and this is a thing that will happen.\n\nMore and more things are becoming automated these days but there are things we still have to do manually. Like adding someone to your contacts list on your phone or in your email. Things like this are probably coming to an end soon. In the video above, a company called RelateIQ is already working on turning your relationship management into an automated thing by building a contacts list automatically based on things like your email inbox and your current contacts list, messages, etc. There will come a point where you just need to ask for someone's name and you can create a contact profile immediately without any work on your part.\n\nWith the aforementioned Google Glass and smartwatches, we're already seeing this to a degree but it's going to get way more crazy than that. Smart glasses and smart watches are social devices that connect you to the outside world. There are other wearable electronics in the works that connect you to your body. We're talking ear buds that measure heart rate, contact lenses that can measure your blood sugar, temporary tattoos that can unlock doors via NFC technology, and all sorts of cool stuff. Once they work this out for consumer use, it wont' be long until you start getting options for implants that'll track your vitals in real time so you'll know you're having a heart attack before your heart does. It's going to save lives.\n\nOnce again, this is a thing that is right on the brink of being a real thing. We already have smart appliances such as refrigerators that will tell you when you're low on a certain food item or an oven you can control with your smartphone. Sometime in the near future these things will be aggregated into an entire home unit that you'll be able to control with your smartphone, tablet, or computer. We're talking changing the thermostat, changing the channel on TV, and getting notifications that your laundry is ready all without leaving your couch. You can preheat the oven for dinner as you leave work so it's ready to cook when you get home. It won't be too much longer before your house talks to you and you can talk to it. The tech is already there, it's just a matter of putting it all together in a stable enough manner for consumers.\n\nYou game nerds out there prepare yourselves. Many gaming fans already know of the Oculus Rift which is a VR headset that plays video games. It was recently bought by Facebook that is actively working on turning it into a social device as well as a gaming device. Samsung is reportedly working on their own as well. There will come a point where you'll be able to go buy one of these headsets, take them anywhere, and watch, play, or view anything. It's already almost there.\n\nScreenless displays are pretty much what they sound like. Displays that display things but without a screen. This technology has apparently come a long way in the last two years and is expected to make even more strides in the coming years. Things like holograms won't be science fiction anymore. There may even be contact lenses that shoot images straight into your eye. This won't just be a breakthrough for entertainment mediums, but people who can't see well will be able to enjoy things for the first time without laser eye surgery.\n\nThese actually already exist to a degree. Quadriplegics have been using them for years to talk through a computer. The technology isn't as refined as it could be but it's well on its way. That means there could be a point in the future where you don't need a mouse or a keyboard anymore. You can just think things and they happen on screen. This is great for people who have disabilities, people who want to be productive, and for gamers.\n\nThis may sound complicated but it's really not because services like this exist. You may have heard of Uber. Uber is a taxi service that you can access pretty much anywhere where Uber has drivers. It's in the U.S. and Europe with more places being planned. What makes Uber unique is its ability to be a universal service. There will come a time where you can call an Uber driver no matter where you are. These kind of services that transcend borders and continents by using the magic of the internet will continue to pop up. It doesn't matter what language you speak or what country you're in, you'll be able to use the same service everywhere. Mark my words, there will be more services like Uber (but for other things aside from transportation) popping up once people have more ideas!\n\nThe end of owning physical copies of a video game are upon us. Popular computer gaming platforms like Steam and Origins have already begun distributing video games digitally without a disc or a cartridge. With the plummeting prices of flash storage (like you find on smartphones) and the increasing stability and speed of the internet, it's absolutely certain that all video games (and media for that matter) will one day be only distributed digitally. That means no more CDs, game discs, DVDs, Blue-Ray, etc. It'll all be files that you download directly to your TV, phone, MP3 player, or video game system. Music has pretty much done this already and movies are well on their way. Soon, it'll be everything. It's hard to imagine but streamlined and mainstream media and game downloads have only been a thing for about half a decade now and they still have a long way to go.\n\nHuge strides have been made in robotics in the last ten years and more are expected to be made in the coming decade. We're not talking fully intelligent robots (yet) but definitely ones that are stable and reliable enough to start working. It'll likely start with places like assembly lines and work their way into other facets of manual labor that humans don't want to do. We're even seriously talking about robots performing surgery on humans while being controlled by a doctor and a technician. You can find demos of robots doing things like shooting wads of paper into trash cans or ones that pour coffee. If those are prototypes, then the finish products can't be all that far behind.\n\nThe people alive right now know one thing for certain. We will be the last living creatures who considered fossil fuels as the only source of energy available on this planet. Within the next few decades, huge strides are expected to be made in solar and wind energy. People are exploring potential fuel sources from everything from wheat to algae. Our dependence on oil and coal is still pretty steadfast but it's beginning to loosen its grip. In the next ten years, expect a huge push for electric cars, solar panels on houses, and lots of complaining from oil company executives.\n\nThere are already examples of this out in the wild. The Qi Wireless charging dock allows people with some smartphones (generally newer ones) to charge their devices without the use of cables. This is a big deal because wireless energy transferring has a lot of applications. When electric cars are a bigger deal, you'll be able to just park on top of a charging center and your car will charge. They may even build solar-powered roads that charges your car as you drive (how cool would that be, really?). The applications are limited only by one's imagination and wireless cell phone charging is just the tip of a very large ice berg.\n\nYes, I know we just now got 4G under control here in the United States and many places in the world are still stuck on 3G. Technology doesn't stop just because we're behind on our infrastructure. Currently 5G is in the research phase but the phrase has been increasingly tossed around. Keep in mind it only took a decade or two to go from 3G to 4G. Don't expect it to take any longer going from 4G to 5G.\n\nYou've seen the movies about it but could it actually exist in our lifetime? The answer is yes, it very well may. If you've seen the famous robot designed by IBM that schooled everyone in Jeopardy then you've already seen the kind of progress we've made in artificial intelligence. There is still a long way to go but thanks to things like contextual technology (Siri, Google Now, Cortana, etc), we're getting a lot better at drawing up software that can predict and react like a real person can. It won't be much longer until it's all integrated together to create a robot that can think.\n\nBack in 2004, the first sheet of graphene was produced. Ever since, scientists have been trying to figure out a way to mass produce it. Why? Because it's going to make everything better. It could give us much faster internet. It's 100 times stronger than steel so naturally it's going to be awesome for building anything. We could use it as a filter for water and scrub the oceans clean of toxic waste. It could be used on smartphones to make them virtually indestructible. It would make batteries obsolete. Truth be told, we're not going to list all the things graphene could be useful for because its applications are practically limitless. Sooner or later we'll figure out how to mass produce it. Prepare for the second industrial revolution where everything is made from graphene. I mean everything. Not kidding.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that most of this stuff was science fiction. To many (including myself) it still seems like something you saw in an episode of Star Trek or read in an HG Wells book. It's almost frightening how far we've come but we're almost there and in a few more decades, it's going to be amazing to see how far we've come.", "(WAVE/CONSUMER REPORTS) - The next big thing in high definition television is here, but is it worth the money? The new technology is making its way to store shelves and maybe your living room ... if people can afford it.\n\nTV manufacturers are phasing out plasma televisions. So we're left mainly with LCD televisions. They're very popular, but Consumer Reports says an emerging technology is really going to shake up the television industry.\n\nThe latest in television technology is called OLED. In Consumer Reports labs, the head of TV testing says it's the best display technology out there, combining the best features of plasmas and LCDs.\n\n\"What we like about OLED is that it delivers on the deep black levels and unlimited viewing angles that we've come to expect from the best plasmas,\" said Claudio Ciacci, Consumer Reports. \"At the same time it delivers on the power efficiency, super-thin bezel design and also the bright picture that we've come to expect from LCD TVs.\"\n\nOLED stands for organic light emitting diodes. Organic refers to the layer of carbon film, which emits light when hit with an electric current.\n\n\"We're running the LG through our usual battery of tests and so far it's delivering on the core performance we're really expecting from this technology,\" said Ciacci. \"But we're also looking at color accuracy, the reproduction of fine detail and the ability to reproduce shades of grey, especially the near black ones. And there we're seeing some subtle issues. But overall the picture is really terrific.\"\n\nOLED TVs started out very expensive. For example, one Samsung model was priced at $10,000 last year. Others were even more. But prices are coming down. The LG now in Consumer Reports' lab is $3,500.\n\n\"We expect to see continued improvements in OLED technology, more manufacturers to enter the OLED TV business in the next year or so and prices to continue to fall,\" said Jim Willcox of Consumer Reports.\n\nAlso coming soon, the marriage of OLED and ultra high-def television that Consumer Reports expects will make a great picture even better.\n\nLG expects to start selling ultra high-def OLED sets this fall. But at this point, prices are still more than a lot of us can pay. LG's 65-inch set costs $10,000 and its 77-inch set will be $25,000.", "PhoneDog Media ExclusiveDownload iM5, now available in the App Store and Google Play. iM5 is a PhoneDog Media backed Social Platform to inspire real-life action through the crowdsourcing of ideas. See the video\n\nCameras have become a major point of differentiation for smartphone manufacturers, with each company trying to make its products stand out by offering unique optics. Samsung's got the Galaxy K Zoom with an optical zoom, HTC has the One (M8) and its Duo Camera with UltraPixel setup and Nokia's Lumia 1020 offers a 41-megapixel PureView shooter. Now Panasonic has unwrapped its own entry into the cameraphone competition.\n\nThe Panasonic Lumix CM1 boasts a 20-megapixel rear camera with a 1-inch sensor and an f/2.8 Leica lens. Also included is a manual control ring, mechanical shutter and 4K UltraHD video capture, making the Lumix CM1 a serious pocket shooter.\n\nOf course, the Lumix CM1 also happens to be a smartphone, and so I'm sure you're interested in finding out how its other specs compare to its rear camera. Answer: pretty well. Panasonic has given its Lumix CM1 a 4.7-inch 1920x1080 display, 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, a microSD slot with support for cards up to 128GB in size and a 2600mAh battery. The phone is powered by Android 4.4 KitKat.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, well, the Panasonic Lumix CM1 and all of its camera goodies won't come cheap. The handset is set to launch in France and Germany for \u20ac900 ($1,150 USD). Panasonic says that it'll see how the Lumix CM1 performs in those two countries and then decide where else it might launch its new cameraphone.\n\nObviously the main draw of the Lumix CM1 is its rear camera, but the rest of its feature set is pretty respectable. You'll pay a pretty penny to call the Lumix CM1 your own, but if you're big on mobile photography, this could be a device worth keeping an eye on.\n\nWould you use the Panasonic Lumix CM1 as your daily driver?", "Samsung's camera division is on a mission: to convince shutterbugs everywhere that mirrorless cameras can be just as powerful and versatile as DSLRs. They made this point a few months ago when they invited New Yorkers to their Ditch the DSLR event and trade it in for a Samsung NX30. Now they're pressing the issue with the new Samsung NX1, a new 28MP flagship camera with fast auto focus and 4K video recording capability.\n\nThough this camera is being pitched as a tool that can satisfy the needs of professional photographers, there are features that make it attractive to people who want great shots in their everyday lives to share with their friends and family. The NX1 is a camera that can capture everything from baby's first smile to the exact moment your Little Leaguer hits her first home run.\n\nAdvanced auto-focus features\n\nSamsung is duly proud of the NX1's speedy auto-focus system which makes it possible to to take perfectly in-focus shots continuously, even if you or your subject moves around. A phase detection system inside tracks moving subjects and even predicts motion, so the camera can put the focus exactly where it needs to be the moment you press the shutter button.\n\nUsing this technology Samsung developed an Auto Shot feature that can automatically capture the moment when a baseball player's bat connects with a pitch. While this might seem like a pretty limited function, Samsung is still developing other scenarios where the tech will be useful.\n\nThe fast auto focus and tracking is available in video mode as well. Want video of a soccer game or just the kids running around and playing? With the NX1 the footage won't just be a blur of motion. And you'll be able to watch it on your Ultra HD or 4K resolution TV with all available pixels intact. The NX1 can record video at both resolutions and can both record and stream to an external source at UHD resolution.\n\nSmart design and comfortable feel\n\nThe NX1's design is more compact than a DSLR but still substantial. It feels solid in the hand with a comfortable, stable grip that gives you a firm hold, even if you attach a heavy lens. The magnesium body is dust and water resistant; when combined with a similarly robust lens you have a camera that can deal with a little rain or a day at the beach without danger of damage.\n\nThe LCD in back is bright and colorful enough to see in direct sunlight and tilts up to 90 degrees for framing shots at difficult angles. There's also an electronic viewfinder that has a seriously short delay--milliseconds--which means no discernible lag between what you see there and what's actually happening in front of you.\n\nIn addition to the usual dials and buttons you'd expect on a high-end camera, the NX1 also has a small LCD on the top showing key settings and battery life, easily read at a glance.\n\nEasy photo transfer functions\n\nThis is a Samsung SMART Camera, so it has Wi-Fi connectivity (b/g/n/ac), NFC, and Bluetooth 3.0. The Bluetooth is for faster pairing with smartphones and tablets for transferring pictures or turning them into remote viewfinders via Samsung's app. With Wi-Fi connectivity you can backup directly to the cloud or even stream pictures or video to a wireless TV set.\n\nThe NX1 is coming in mid-October and will cost $1499 for just the body. As I said, this is primarily aimed at serious photographers, folks who tend to have compatible lenses already. However, you can buy the Pro Bundle, which includes a very nice 16-50 mm lens, a battery grip (for easy portrait orientation shots), an extra battery and a charger for $2799.\n\nIf you've already invested in a Samsung NX series camera but want to up your game and take great pictures in any situation, the NX1 is definitely worth a look. It's a high-end camera in a relatively compact body that is so easy to use and hold. It will inspire you to learn how to take better pictures and explore the world outside of the Auto setting.", "Panasonic has just announced what is allegedly the best cameraphone yet. The Lumix CM1 is a smartphone that looks and acts much like a higher-end compact camera, and it comes with a 1-inch sensor (much like Sony's RX100 camera), which also happens to be the largest sensor on a smartphone or \"cameraphone\" you can find. (Nokia's Lumia 1020 used a 1/1.5\" sensor, while Samsung's Galaxy K Zoom uses a 1/2.3\" sensor).\n\nThe sensor also has 20 MP resolution, which should be more than enough to offer a high-level of detail while also delivering relatively high-performance. To wit, the device comes with a 2.3 GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal storage and microSD support up to 128 GB. The device can shoot 4k video, so going for the maximum microSD storage would be a good idea, as 4k video tends to fill up \"standard\" 32 GB or even 64 GB microSDs pretty quickly.\n\nThe Lumix CM1 cameraphone also comes with an f/2.8 Leica DC Elmarit lens for some extra-sharp image quality, a hardware shutter button and a slider to switch between camera and smartphone modes. The screen is 4.7\" and has a 1080p resolution, which should be crisp enough to preview images before taking them.\n\nThe device appears well-designed, but it seems Panasonic tried to make it look as much as possible like a regular camera. It's unclear why the company would do this, and whether it was intentional or just the result of putting the camera division in charge of designing a cameraphone. While the device still looks beautiful overall, it would likely be much more appealing if it tried to look more like a smartphone.\n\nThe Lumix CM1 is also quite thick at 21 mm, which is more than twice as thick as most smartphones. It's even thicker than Samsung's Galaxy K Zoom, which measures 16.6 mm. This could be another disadvantage of a hardware division that doesn't have much experience with manufacturing slim smartphones, but is instead used to making much thicker cameras. A good strategy for camera companies in the future could be to partner with smartphone companies to create a great-looking and high-performance camera phone together.\n\nThe price of 900 euro for the Lumix CM1 seems a little high even for this type of device, but it could interest photographers or those really passionate about taking pictures with their smartphones. The device will be available only in France and Germany for now and will launch during the holiday season.", "It would appear that the pre-order systems at Apple and their carrier partners were struggling for a very good reason. Apple has announced that pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have crossed the 4 million mark, with a full week before actual retail sales begin.\n\nThere should be no surprise that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are already popular phones. Apple is doing a lot of good things with iOS 8, and the increase in screen size for this next generation of hardware has a lot of people willing to make the upgrade. We usually see significant pre-order numbers for iOS products, but the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has broken all previous pre-order records for Apple.\n\nTo put this into context, Samsung shipped 11 Million Galaxy S5 units to retail partners in the first month their flagship was available to purchase. While Samsung never released pre-order numbers for that phone, Market Research firm Counterpoint claimed Samsung only sold 5 million units in the US during that first month. Samsung is without a doubt the biggest competitor to Apple when it comes to hardware manufacturers, which goes a long way to applying some scope to just how big Apple's pre-order announcement is.\n\nAs is often the case with Apple product launches, keeping up with the demand as people line up to purchase the phone at retail locations is going to be next to impossible. We know that some of the larger Apple stores already have lines forming outside of them, but for many others it is going to be a long Thursday night if they expect to grab a phone on launch day.", "Galaxy Note 4 has more raw powerSamsung's phone has better display specs\n\nIf you can't beat them join them. Then beat them. That seems to be Apple's response to the proliferation of large-screen Android and Windows Phone handsets. After years of holding out as the only important phone manufacturer without a phablet, Apple has gone all in. And how.\n\nThe iPhone 6 Plus is not just big, it is huge. Bringing a 5.5in display into the iOS world for the first time. It's an iPhone, so it is almost duty bound to be awesome. But it is entering a fiercely competitive world. (See also: iPhone 6 review.)\n\nThe iPhone 6 Plus was unveiled just a few days after Samsung announced its own new large-screen smartphone: the Galaxy Note 4. The Galaxy Note range is the undisputed king of the large-screen phablet world. So how does Apple's entry compare to the best of the rest?\n\nWe compared the Galaxy Note 4 with the iPhone 6 Plus. This iPhone 6 Plus vs Galaxy Note 4 comparison is based on the hands on time with both devices, and a good look at the specs and pricing data for each handset. (Related articles you might like: iPhone 6 review | iPhone 6 release date | iPhone 6 Plus release date | iPhone reviews.)\n\nThe Galaxy Note 4 is a premium high-end smartphone so it's no surprise to see it with a price tag of around \u00a3550 inc VAT for the 32GB edition. The iPhone 6 Plus costs a bit more. There are three models which start at \u00a3619 for the 16GB model. This scales up to \u00a3699 for 64GB, and \u00a3789 for 128GB. You will pay a premium for the iPhone phablet, so let's see what you get for the money.\n\nWith the Galaxy Note 4 you get a 2.7 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor or Exynos 5433 octa-core processor, and 3GB of RAM. We found it to be extremely smooth and snappy when launching and switching apps.\n\nThe iPhone 6 Plus comes with a new processor, known as the A8. This is a 20-nanometer 64-bit CPU with 2 billion transistors. Early benchmarking using the Geekbench application suggests that the processor is dual core, and has a frequency of 1.4 GHz. It's paired with 2GB RAM. The iPhone 6 Plus is consummately slick and zippy in use\n\nDon't take this to mean that the iPhone 6 Plus will be appreciably slower than is the Galaxy Note 4. iOS is more tightly coded than is Android, and so typically iPhones feel every bit as zippy as Android handsets with nominally superior specs.\n\nBut given the price differential we would like to see the iPhone 6 Plus be noticably faster than the Galaxy Note 4, and that is almost certainly not the case. And if you are getting a big-screen handset to run multiple tasks at the same time, the lack of cores will eventually tell in terms of pure performance. (See also: iPhone 5s v Galaxy S5 comparison review.)\n\nThe screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is stunning. It's a 5.7in Quad-HD Super AMOLED display. That's a resolution of 2560 x 1440, which means a whopping 515ppi pixel density. The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD screen, which means in this case a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a pixel density of 401 ppi. So again lagging behind in terms of pure specs, but will you notice the difference? Apple says it offers wider viewing angles because of its dual-domain pixels, after all.\n\nWhile using the Note 4, we found that the screen had an incredible sense of depth, and we can imagine that it'll be difficult to go back to full-HD once you've used a smartphone or tablet with a Quad HD screen like this one. Which is not to say the the iPhone 6 Plus display is in any way a bad screen, just that the Note 4's is quantifiably better.\n\nWhen you buy a smartphone, we're sure that which colour you choose is an important decision - unless you always opt for black no matter what the device. For those who care about it, the Galaxy Note 4 a choice of black, white, gold and pink. The iPhone 6 Plus looks gorgeous. The design is roughly similar to that of the iPhone 5s, only on a grander scale, and with a generally more rounded chassis. As with all iPhones, build quality is excellent. Buttons and switches are uniformly firm and responsive, and the Ring/Silent switch produced a satisfying click.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 4 is 8.5 mm thick and weighs and 176 g. These are impressive specs but they can't compete with the only just 7.1mm thick iPhone 6 Plus, and just 172 g. Overall dimensions see the 153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5 mm Galaxy Note 4 largely match the profile of the taller but thinner 158.1 x 77.8 x 7.1 mm iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nOne small concern about the iPhone is the rear-facing camera, which sticks out a little bit and marginally spoils the integrity of the iPhone 6 Plus's profile. Laying the iPhone 6 Plus down on its back on a hard, flat surface may cause it to sit unevenly.\n\nThe key thing here is that both are big handsets, but Apple claims its is usable with one hand, the Note 4 comes with the S Pen stylus and is designed for two-handed use. It's also worth considering the fact that the iPhone may well require a case, but the Galaxy Note 4 will live without.\n\nOverall, however, we'd say that design and build is a win for the iPhone.\n\nThe 32GB Galaxy Note 4 comes with a microSD card slot which can take up to 128GB cards. The iPhone 6 Plus comes in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB flavourns, but has no expandable storage. Onboard storage is always better for performance, but it is reflected in the price. None the less, with the exception of the next to useless 16GB model, we prefer the iPhone's storage options.\n\nAndroid vs iOS is a conundrum. Android isn't like it used to be: if you are new to the smartphone game there's no obvious winner. These are the two most popular and best mobile operating systems around so it's about picking which one is right for you.\n\nIn essence, if you are a long-term iOS user you are probably best off sticking with what you know. You have after all almost certainly spent a lot of cash on apps that you'll have to spend again in Android. But it is worth considering that your iTunes music files will work in Android, and Android offers the opportunity of shopping around for music, movies, books and TV shows.\n\nThe iPhone 6 Plus has the same top-line megapixel numbers as the iPhone 5s: 8Mp on the rear, and 1.2Mp on the front. But some things are more important than megapixel count. Apple assures us that the new iSight camera is better than its predecessor in many ways: optical image stabilisation, is an impressive addition; as is continuous-autofocus when shooting video. We like the option of 240fps slo-mo video as well as 120fps. Improved panorama shots, face detection and low-light performance, round out Apple's claimed improvements. And burst mode has been added to the front-facing camera as well the rear one.\n\nSamsung has improved the camera in the Galaxy Note 4, and we found the results to be quite impressive. The rear-facing camera is 16Mp, with auto focus and Smart OIS (optical image stabilisation). HDR on the Galaxy Note 4 offers a live preview, so you can see exactly what your image will look like before you capture it.\n\nOn the front is a 3.7Mp camera with an aperture of f1.9. Samsung has introduced a fun Wide Selfie mode with the Note 4, so you can capture more of the environment around you when taking those all-important and extremely popular selfies with the front-facing camera.\n\nOne thing we did find is that the size of the Note 4 means taking photographs is not an exceptionally easy task. It can get a bit clumsy, particularly if you are trying to take a photo with one hand.\n\nOn the face of it we prefer the Galaxy Note's more impressive spec. But we haven't yet properly tested either camera. So for now we'll call it a close-run thing.

However, the report suggests that the old generation Windows Phone devices might not receive all the new features.\n\nOne of the biggest purported Windows Phone 9 features being highlighted by the report is the split-screen multitasking; though, it does not specify any minimum screen size requirement for the feature. It speculates that the minimum size might be 4.9-inch or higher.\n\nIt's worth noting that Microsoft introduced the split-screen feature in its Windows 8.1 update, where users were able to snap apps in variable sizes. The feature allows users to run three apps simultaneously on one screen and run different apps on different displays if connected, while keeping the Start screen on one display. The split-screen feature has already been introduced by Android handset OEMs like Samsung (Multi Window feature).\n\nReports have been tipping that Microsoft has plans to remove the Nokia branding from its upcoming devices this holiday season, alongside plans to drop the 'Phone' from the Windows Phone name and logo as part of the transition to the unifying 'Threshold' Windows 9 update.\n\nMicrosoft on Monday started sending invitations that read \"Join us to hear what's next for Windows and the enterprise,\" to a September 30 event where the company is expected to reveal the next version of its Windows operating system.\n\nThe next iteration of Windows, likely to be called Windows 9, is internally codenamed as the 'Threshold' update - one that is said to unify operating systems across different device form factors.\n\nMultiple reports, apart from a more touch-friendly interface for smartphones and tablets, have been tipping that Windows 9 will bring an optimised interface for keyboard and mouse users on desktops, laptops, and hybrid tablets.", "COLOGNE, Germany -- Smartphones have largely replaced compact cameras, but Panasonic launched a new product called the CM1 to bring the two product categories together.\n\nDepending on how you look at it, it's either a very slim camera or a somewhat bulky Android phone. Its standout feature is a large f2.8 28mm-equivalent lens made by Leica and an accompanying 1-inch, 20-megapixel sensor.\n\nIf you like the idea, you'll probably just have to sigh wistfully, because Panasonic only will sell it in Germany and France, at least for starts when it goes on sale in the fourth quarter. The company unveiled the product at the Photokina show here this week, but didn't reveal pricing.\n\nThe usual difficulties of global sales -- language support, foreign exchange rates, and so on -- are even more complicated for phones. Different countries and different network operators use different wireless radio frequencies, a problem called spectrum fragmentation that afflicts device makers.\n\nThe hybrid approach is classically difficult: it's hard to be as good at two things compared to more specialized equipment tailored for just one or the the other. Smartphones are general-purpose already, including a lesser camera than the CM1's, and it seems likely the bulk of the market will stick with more conventional designs. But the premium smartphone market is a tough place to stand out, and Panasonic's certainly does do that.\n\nIt's hard to beat a mainstream giant like a Samsung Galaxy S5 or an Apple iPhone, but the battle for the smartphone niches is more open. That's how phablets got their start -- and now look at the 5.5-inch screen on the coming Apple iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nPanasonic's CM1 Android-camera hybrid (pictures) See full gallery 1 - 4 of 11 Next Prev\n\nPanasonic isn't the first to try the hybrid approach. Samsung has done a reasonable job with its Galaxy Camera, though initial products that tried to act as a mobile phone didn't fare as well as customers gravitated toward the Wi-Fi-only option. Few people want a second mobile phone service contract, it appears. Panasonic clearly is hoping the CM1 will be people's actual phone, not just a compact camera that happens to run Android.\n\nAnother hybrid approach came with the Nikon Coolpix S810c in April, which don't have any phone aspirations. Nikon hasn't had much success with the first-generation S800c that arrived in 2012, though. And more from the phone side of the business, Nokia's smartphone team (now part of Microsoft) has pushed its higher-end PureView line of phone cameras.\n\nThe CM1's lens protrudes a bit, but when you push a manual camera button on top to switch the camera on, the lens extends a little more. Surrounding the lens is a manual adjustment ring, but plenty of the controls are reached using the 4.7-inch 1,920x1,080-pixel touch screen.\n\nThe camera also will shoot 4K video, Panasonic said.\n\nThe device will come with Android 4.4 KitKat and use LTE networks. It's got 16GB internal storage, 2GB of memory, a microSDXC slot for expandable storage up to 128GB, and uses a 2.3GHz Qualcomm quad-core processor complemented by Panasonic's Venus Engine image processor.\n\nThe camera measures about the width and height of a premium smartphone, 135.4x68mm, but it's thicker at 15.2mm. At its thickest part, with the lens pulled in, it measures 21.1mm. It weighs 204 grams.", "In the pursuit of higher quality, there's often a disconnect between what top executives think about a company's performance and how those with the word \"quality\" in their job title view it.\n\nThat's one of the conclusions from a survey of 1,010 senior leaders and 1,281 quality professionals done by ASQ, formerly known as the American Society for Quality.\n\nIn the new research from Milwaukee-based ASQ and Forbes Insights, the research arm of Forbes Media, 72% of senior executives rated their quality-management programs as among the best in the world, while 40% of midlevel, quality-focused professionals viewed their company's programs that way.\n\nThe further from the top-level positions, the less favorable the view of a company's culture of quality, according to the research.\n\nIn some cases, senior management is given a \"prettied up\" picture of what's going on in their organization.\n\n\"I think the deeper you dive into an organization's chart, the closer those people are to the detail of what is happening. If you're close to the challenge, you see the precise changes still needing to be made. Whereas from the top, you see great progress,\" Dan Afseth, software development leader at Intuit Inc., a publisher of business and accounting software, said in the ASQ research.\n\nThe survey revealed some disturbing trends, according to ASQ, which interviewed top executives and others at U.S. and foreign companies.\n\nOnly 47% of the respondents said their leaders lead by example or \"live\" the company values. Only 50% said support for the quality vision is apparent among middle management.\n\nAlthough 48% said customer needs are the key driver of their quality programs, only 24% said their organizations were highly effective in identifying customer needs and expectations for quality.\n\n\"There's a gap there as well,\" ASQ spokesman Kevin Braley said.\n\nBusinesses range from those where quality is just a slogan to those where it's a deep focus for everyone from the chief executive officer on down, Bruce Rogers, chief insights officer at Forbes Media, said in the research.\n\nSenior leaders with \"chief\" in their title tended to view quality performance more favorably than other survey respondents.\n\nThe disparity is likely due to filtered, big-picture material that has been prepared for management, while other employees use a \"classic score card\" for their views, said Laurel Nelson-Rowe, ASQ managing director.\n\nOne way to close the gap between perception and reality is to poll an organization on quality performance, according to ASQ.\n\n\"Being left in the dark is not the culture that senior management wants to embody,\" Nelson-Rowe said.\n\nThe research included examples of companies challenging the status quo and attempting to be more open in their communication. For example, Tata Group, an India-based consortium of more than 100 companies, has instituted a \"Dare to Try\" award for individuals or company teams that made a daring attempt to accomplish something but failed.\n\nThe point of the award, from Tata's group chairman, is to reward risk-taking even if it sometimes means failure.\n\nA healthy quality-of-culture operates even in the face of fear, Nelson-Rowe said. It can mean stopping a production line and bringing a problem to the attention of senior management, even if it involves the chief executive.\n\nASQ has membership in more than 150 countries. The research from ASQ and Forbes has examples of culture-of-quality at companies including Samsung, FedEx, Hewlett-Packard and Tata.\n\nBraley said he hopes it fosters discussions at all levels of companies, but changes have to be driven by senior leadership.\n\nChanges also have to be driven by economics. FedEx said it realized hundreds of millions of dollars in savings through a quality-management program.\n\n\"If these are ideas that could be implemented in other organizations, worldwide, the level of savings could be astronomical,\" Braley said.", "Samsung released XXUGNH4 Android 4.4.2 for Samsung Galaxy S4 i9500.

In the wake of store listings and government filings, Thegioididong has managed to get its hands on the unannounced Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime (aka G530), a 5-inch budget Android phone that's seemingly tailor-made for self-portraits. Its centerpiece is undoubtedly its 5-megapixel front-facing camera; while that's certainly not the highest resolution we've seen, it's unusually powerful for a device that's likely to be cheap off-contract. The rest of the phone won't be much to write home about, although it shouldn't be a slouch as far as low-cost phones go. While the 960 x 540 screen is disappointing, there will also be a respectable 1.2GHz quad-core processor (likely a Snapdragon 400 or", "Why is the Apple Watch a bit, well, boring? Because the next set of problems Apple has to solve is so much less fun than the last.\n\nThe Macintosh made you a painter. The iPod put 1,000 songs in your pocket. The iPhone turned us all into amateur photographers. Then the iPad offered up a blank canvas limited only by imagination.\n\nNow what does the Apple Watch do? Functionally, its biggest breakthrough is that it can pay for things very conveniently, with just a tap of the wrist. Its biggest advertised feature is by all measures and accounts, boring.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple's success can be attributed to, as Steve Jobs put it, design innovations that live specifically at the intersection between technology and liberal arts. To be fair, the Apple Watch doesn't solve these types of problems, in part, because Apple has already solved so many of them. They already made the connected world accessible from your pocket. They already gave us a portable screen that we could draw pretty well on. The world will never be blown away by an MP3 player again. That moment came and went.\n\nI was disappointed by the Apple Watch announcement for the same reasons you may have been. Its industrial design, while featuring thoughtful elements like a magnetic clasp, easily swappable bands, and that clever \"digital crown\" navigation system, ostensibly resembled the smartwatches we've already seen from companies like Samsung and Motorola--as if Apple showed up casually late to a party they were too cool for, only to realize, everybody else there was wearing its same shoes. I mean, the iPhone floored you the first time you saw it, as if Apple had traveled to the future and stolen it back for all of us to share. The Apple Watch was a Samsung Galaxy Gear dipped in rose gold, the blush wine of the precious metal world.\n\nBut the bigger reason to be disappointed--the one that matters beyond my personal taste or our insatiable thirst for the new--is that the Apple Watch isn't connected to anything particularly beautiful or fun. Think about it: Every major Apple release has been grounded in some landmark support of multimedia, helpfully enabled by a breakthrough in user interaction. The Macintosh let you paint because it made your hand feel like a natural extension of the cursor on-screen. The iPod paired a deeply organized music collection with a wheel that could explore artists, albums, genres, and individual tracks with equal grace.\n\nWhether it was the iPad's touchscreen, or the iPod's music library, Apple devices either made you an artist, or gave you a better way to consume art. But the closest the Apple Watch comes to this idea is allowing you control your music from your wrist or scribble a doodle to beam to a friend. Nothing about the Apple Watch will fundamentally shift the way we experience TV, movies, photos or music. The Apple Watch has little appreciation for art or creativity.\n\nSo what design challenges lay ahead for Apple? Boring ones. Taking a cue from the Apple Watch, you see two highly lucrative, infrastructure-level problems: payments and health. They're certainly important problems worthy of Apple's attention, but that doesn't make them fun.\n\nPayments is the ultimate snoozefest. Yes, our credit card infrastructure is decades old. No, it's probably not secure enough to protect our accounts in the digital age. Yes, there is a better way. And Apple, by making deals with the likes of Visa and Mastercard, will be giving it to us because it will make them a whole lot of money, and the logical point of, why shouldn't your phone double as your wallet? We'll all use it, but nobody will be amazed because payments are boring.\n\nThe second big solution is health tracking. Health is really important. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. And maybe, just maybe, Apple can manage to exchange and combine my vitals with the data my health provider has to offer some kind of realtime analytics. I can barely begin to comprehend how important that could be. Building the right digital health is one of the biggest design, political, and infrastructural challenges of the modern era. But health data is boring. And when it isn't boring, it's worse; it's depressing or even devastating.\n\nDesign has evolved at breakneck speeds in the last decade, and we largely have Apple to thank for that, for lighting a fire under the entire industry of electronics manufacturers to think of their esoteric gadgets as fun, approachable experiences that can bring new moments of joy to our lives.\n\nHowever, Apple will have a tougher time standing out to consumers over the next decade because so many of the fun problems have already been solved. And the problems that remain are just as much, if not more, about solving boring infrastructural issues than they are about designing experiences that are truly new.\n\nWhy doesn't the Apple Watch truly revolutionize payments? Why doesn't it let us buy a can of Campbell's soup just by removing it from the shelf at a Walmart? The technology is capable. Apple's designers are more than clever enough to think up that idea, too.\n\nBut even if Apple has the innovative ideas, the infrastructure won't allow it yet. Walmart hasn't lined its shelves with NFC receivers, and who knows, maybe it would upset Visa for some reason, too. As a result of infrastructure, Apple's new shiny wallet on your wrist ends up looking just like Google's old tattered thing in your pocket.\n\nAnd after payments and health, consider what future issues are next: education, finances, environmental footprint, governmental communications, data security, and personal safety.\n\nThese ideas aren't fun. No silhouetted model wearing earbuds will ever be spotted dancing to the beat of your heart. But sometimes even the cool kids should stop having fun and tackle some of the world's real problems. And this begs the question: will the masses keep buying Apple products along the way?", "Recently I have returned from IFA in Berlin and I have felt the need to report on one device in particular that really impressed me to no end. This year we saw some very interesting products from Samsung, Sony and even Phillips, however there was one device that, in my opinion, really stole the show if everything I was told is correct.\n\nWeighing it at a possible \u00a3275-\u00a3300 is the Alcatel Hero 2. This little known French company grabs the bull by the horns this year and produced a phone that is, on the one hand budget friendly, yet on the other it manages to capture almost everything that every other manufacturer has injected into their latest and greatest. We have no affiliated with Alcatal, and to my knowledge never have, how this Hero 2 handset impressed the sock off me.\n\nCase and point.\n\nYes, the Hero 2 features a 6'' TFT LCD display. The TFT technology is a little off putting these days, however at the 1080p resolution (367 ppi), and with Dragontrail glass for protection and oleophobic coating this phone almost looks just as good at a Note III. Certainly setting it next to the Note 4, the difference will be night and day however the average user will be looking for something that is easily passable for usage and this is will certainly meets the challenge.\n\nInside the Hero 2 is a MediaTek MT6592 chipset with an octa-core 1.7GHz Cortex-A7 CPU and 2G of RAM. Internal storage is 16GB expandable by up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. Things run smoothly and with a refreshingly sparse overlay. There are still additions from Alcatel however no where near that we see on the Samsung and Sony devices shown. It was nice to go back to a more familiar interface having spent time with the likes of the Sony Xperia Z3.\n\nYou also get Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.0, NFC and 4G. The battery of the Hero 2 is a hefty 3,100mAh rated at a 10hours of 3G talk time (4.5h in 4G mode) and stand-by time of 380 hours. A rather decent 13MP OIS camera sits on the back with a single LED flash and recording video of up to 1080p@30fps. There is a stylus in the Hero 2 and it's very similar to the Samsung S Pen. Alongside this are a couple of peripherals. For example a game pad, touch screen game controller that click onto the Hero 2 providing protection and simple interaction.\n\nOf all the phones on display in Berlin, this is the one that made the biggest impression on me, and I have thought most about since. Certainly, Lenovo, Samsung and Sony all had strong offerings featuring revolutionary technologies, however it was Alcatel who produced a simple, elegant, well made and modestly priced road warrior. Provided the price translates when crossing the channel...", "11 CONNECT 34 TWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nAt Reviewed.com this week, we wrapped up our coverage of IFA, Europe's largest electronics show. We also reported on a story that could have a seismic impact on the appliance industry: Electrolux bought GE Appliances for $3.3 billion. Speaking of appliances, our team tested out a slew this week, including two notable TVs -- a 50-inch LG TV that also won our Editor's Choice award, and a curved LED TV from Samsung.\n\nIn our news and features department, we covered a simple idea that might help to end wasteful food packaging: yogurt pearls. We also looked at a new device that could be the holy grail for cord-cutters -- plus, an ingenious fridge that responds to your texts by sending a selfie, and a scientific experiment that shows we can rewire our brains to crave healthy food.\n\nCould yogurt pearls spell the end of overdone food packaging?\n\nNeedless waste is a growing global concern, and much of U.S. packaging waste comes from cardboard and plastic food containers. A start-up is trying to change that, using something called yogurt pearls. WikiFoods has created edible food packaging called WikiPearls that replicates fruit and vegetable skins, and will soon be available in 35 Whole Foods locations.\n\nLG LED TV emphasizes simplicity\n\n4K has quickly become the new standard in ultra high-definition TVs, but not everyone wants -- or can afford -- to adopt the tech just yet. For those who want a solid non-4K TV, there aren't many better options than LG's 50LB5900 LED TV. It might lack bells and whistles like 3-D functionality and smart features, but it does produce a great image at a reasonable price.\n\nNew device wants to be the nail in cable's coffin\n\nMore and more people are ditching cable, but online alternatives like Netflix and Roku still fall short when it comes to live television. Simple.TV is the latest device seeking to fill this void. It works by letting you save over-the-air broadcasts to an external hard drive, and from there you can stream content to a variety of devices. It could be the holy grail for cord-cutters -- if it isn't outlawed, that is.\n\nKenmore vacuum cleaner is perfect for pet owners\n\nThis vacuum from Kenmore might not have fancy design, but it still excels at what it's supposed to do: clean up nearly any surface it touches. In fact, it cleans on carpets and bare floors almost as effectively as pricier models. In addition, it comes with special attachments specifically designed to deal with animal hair, making it an ideal choice for cleaning up after your furry friends.\n\nNew Panasonic TV commits to picture quality\n\nWe recently had a chance to check out Panasonic's latest 4K TV gem. On display at the IFA show in Berlin, it may be the next big thing. Featuring a new kind of display called full-array backlighting, the Panasonic AX900 offers excellent image quality, in addition to Ultra HD compatibility with Netflix and Amazon.\n\nOlympus' newest superzoom camera has its sights set on you\n\nThe superzoom market has proved difficult to figure out for many camera makers. Consumers have been clamoring for more zoom, but after a certain point image quality seriously suffers. Olympus is the latest company to enter the superzoom fray, but unfortunately its Stylus SP-100EE, like many similar cameras, sacrifices image quality at its higher zoom levels.\n\nText this fridge, and it will send you a selfie\n\nAn innovation from LG might be the most ingenious implementation of smart technology in the kitchen yet. The company's new RF874SBSS refrigerator features a camera that can take pictures of its insides. What's more, if you send it a text using LG's smartphone app, it will send you a selfie -- allowing you to easily keep track of what's in your fridge, no matter where you are. (The jury's still out on whether \"fridge selfie\" will take off as a hashtag.)\n\nSamsung curved LED TV stays ahead of the curve\n\nThe debate rages on among AV enthusiasts about whether curved displays actually enhance a TV's picture quality or level of immersion, but one thing is clear: Curved TVs are more expensive than non-curved TVs. This curved model from Samsung is no exception, but fortunately it backs up its price tag with great picture quality, excellent smart features and several useful accessories.\n\nGE Appliances sold to Electrolux for $3.3 billion\n\nNews broke early Monday morning that GE was selling its Appliance brand to Electrolux for $3.3 billion. Pending regulatory approval, the move would put one of America's most iconic brands in the hands of a Swedish company, and would have huge implications for the appliance industry. It might also lead to factories closing and job losses. Consumers probably won't notice any changes in the short term, however.\n\nGE electric range offers lots of features, but can't bake a cake\n\nThe new GE Profile electric range offers a bevy of fancy features, which sort of explain its hefty price tag (it retails for more than $2,500). Some of these options, especially its smart design choices, are useful. Unfortunately, when it comes to basic performance, it feels like a much cheaper appliance. If you plan to bake a cake, you might want to stay away from this oven.\n\nScience: We can rewire our brains to crave healthy foods\n\nGetting ourselves to eat healthy foods is always a struggle, but what if our brains could be trained to actually crave vegetables? Well, a study from a Tufts University scientist suggests we can do just that -- and it's not as sinister as it sounds. The study's participants changed their diet and behavior, and over time they began to associate the healthy foods with feeling good. This finding could be an important step toward maintaining sustainable weight control.\n\n11 CONNECT 34 TWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1rZGSCV", "15 CONNECT 72 TWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Interested in a fitness band but not sure where to jump in? Misfit Wearables, maker of the distinctive-looking Shine fitness tracker, is hoping to lure consumers with a $50 take on its distinctive-looking fitness disc.\n\nThe new Shine tracker is made of soft plastic instead of aluminum. Like Shine, you can use it to track movement and sleep. It syncs with a companion app for Android, Apple and Windows Phone devices.\n\nFlash is one big button. An LED display shines through to show you your progress, or the time.\n\nWith smartwatches hitting the market from tech heavyweights including Samsung, LG, Motorola, Sony and soon Apple, fitness band makers will be jockeying for a place on consumers' bodies.\n\n\"Flash is the only fully featured activity and sleep tracker in the world for under $50, making it an incredible value,\" Tim Golnik, Misfit's VP of Product and Design, said in a release.\n\nMisfit's Shine, and now Flash, has several things going for it: It's waterproof, and doesn't require charging. Its internal battery can last up to a year, the company says. In addition to automatically registering steps and distance you can use it to track things like cycling and swimming.\n\nFlash is not quite as water-resistant as Shine -- 30 meters for Flash compared to 50 meters for Shine. You can wear it on your wrist, lapel, shoes or wherever. It comes with a clasp and sport band.\n\nIt's coming starting later this month to retailers including Best Buy, Target and Walmart and can be pre-ordered now at misfit.com/flash.\n\nFollow Nancy Blair on Twitter: @nansanfran.\n\n15 CONNECT 72 TWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1u25B67", "8 CONNECT 14 TWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nSamsung bolstered its mirrorless camera lineup in a big way by unveiling the new NX1 at the massive Photokina 2014 photography show. The company's new flagship far outstrips any camera it has ever made, with a bevy of pro-ready features and enough horsepower to out-muscle a DSLR.\n\nFor starters, the NX1 looks just like a DSLR. It has some Samsung-standard design elements (like a dedicated Wi-Fi button), but it also has a chunky grip, a sizable magnesium alloy body and weather sealing. There are three control dials, customizable buttons and a mode dial with two user-savable custom modes included.\n\nThe new 28-megapixel backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS image sensor is the first ever BSI APS-C sensor. It can handle bursts at up to 15 frames per second, and can shoot 4K video. Crucially, it can do this with standard Class 10 SDHC cards, meaning you won't have to pick up new, ridiculously expensive high-speed cards.\n\nThe sensor itself might be the star of the show. Samsung specifically called out the shallow well depth of the individual pixels, which have the same pixel pitch as the NX30's sensor. While \"shallow\" sounds like it'd be a negative when it comes to collecting light, it actually allows more light to hit the photosensitive areas from acute angles, making high ISO shooting more efficient.\n\nOnce you get past the pro-ready features, it's clear that the NX1 is still a Samsung camera. There's a huge emphasis on wireless connectivity, with Wi-Fi, NFC and bluetooth for simple wireless pairing with the camera. For wired connectivity there's an HDMI 1.4 port and a USB 3.0 power that can be used to charge the camera at up to 2 amps. Mike and headphone jacks are onboard, as well.\n\nThe viewfinder is paired with a 3-inch articulated touch FVGA (720x480) AMOLED rear display. The LCD screen doesn't swing out from the body, but instead tilts and angles upward 90 degrees and downward 45 degrees.\n\nThe NX1 also has some new modes to help get the shot you want. One that sounds especially intriguing is a new baseball \"Auto Shot\" mode. In this setting you can frame up a hitter and specify from what side the ball will enter the frame. The camera tracks the ball at up to 240 frames per second and triggers the shutter when it thinks the bat will hit the ball.\n\nAlongside the NX1, Samsung also announced another S-series lens at Photokina. Like the existing 16-50mm f/2.8 S lens, the new 50-150mm f/2.8 S is water-resistant, dustproof and has a durable metal mount.\n\nIf you're eager to pick up the NX1, you'll likely be able to get your hands on one this fall for $1,499.99 body-only. There will also be a \"pro\" kit, which will include a 16-50mm f/2.8 S lens, a battery grip, an additional battery, and an external charger for a grand total of $2,799.99.\n\nTo stay up to date with all of the news, hands-on impressions, and videos from Cologne, Germany's 2014 photography show head over to Reviewed.com's Photokina 2014 page.\n\n8 CONNECT 14 TWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1tXFc9p", "The newly announced iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may have received more than 4 million pre-orders in 24 hours, but the two devices are facing a delayed launch in China.\n\nAt this point it's really unclear when the iPhone 6 will arrive in the world's biggest smartphone market. Not even China Mobile knows. And that's the country's biggest carrier, with around 800 million customers.\n\nAccording to an unconfirmed report, Apple has yet to get its new iPhones certified for sale in China by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which has apparently failed to reach an agreement with the Cupertino-based company on the matter. Without this certification, you simply can't legally sell phones in China, so the situation isn't looking good for Apple.\n\nIn fact, it may have to wait until next year to receive said certification and hence be able to launch the iPhone 6 in China. This could come as a pretty big blow in terms of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nIn the meantime, China Mobile will focus on selling unsubsidized 4G capable smartphones for the remainder of this year. Company execs have predicted that by the end of the year, 70% of the 4G smartphones it sells will cost less than 1,000 yuan ($162). But there will also be handsets priced at less than 600 yuan ($97).\n\nAs it starts focusing more and more on such mass-market offerings, China Mobile plans to cut around $2 billion in subsidies for mobile phones, a move which will affect sales of high-end devices made by the likes of Apple and Samsung.\n\nTo get an idea of how big these subsidies are right now, let's consider the iPhone 5S. It currently has a list price of 5,288 yuan ($860) when purchased with a contract. China Mobile will subsidise up to 88% of that value (bringing the upfront cost down to 635 yuan, or $103), but in that case you need a plan that will set you back 388 yuan ($63) per month.", "Analyst company Juniper Research estimates that global smartphone shipments for 2014 will reach 1.2 billion units. That's a 19% increase compared to 2013 when global smartphone shipments were estimated at 985 million.\n\nThe growth in smartphone shipments comes primarily from emerging markets. There, the sub-$150 offerings are selling like hot cakes and this trend is expected to continue. Smartphones below the $75 mark are expected to bring further growth to the market.\n\nJR points out that Apple and Samsung are dominating the premium end of the market, which leaves other companies feel the pressure from local players with cheap alternatives. Most notably, Xiaomi is enjoying an enormous success in China, while Google is pushing its Android One initiative in India.\n\nThe company reckons the iPhone 6 Plus has the potential to \"change the dynamics\" of the phablet market and give the Galaxy Note 4 a run for its money. Surely, both will enjoy a solid first weeks of sales, but it's yet to be seen how users will adopt the grown-up Apple smartphone offerings.\n\nIt's interesting to note that according to the research, Apple and Samsung are currently responsible for 45% of the global smartphone shipments. That might change though as the analysts expect the average price of a smartphone to decline globally to $274 by 2019.", "BGR reviewed the new Moto X earlier on Tuesday and to say that we were impressed is an understatement. In fact, we not only called the Moto X the best Android phone in the world but we also said that \"when it comes to the user experience, no phone we've come across can match Motorola's brand new Moto X.\" This is indeed high praise and now Motorola is giving the world its own take on why you should pick up its newest flagship phone in a series of new ads flagged by Droid Life.\n\nREAD OUR REVIEW OF THE NEW MOTO X: Say hello to the best Android phone in the world\n\nWhat these ads do effectively is to show off some of the unique new features that Motorola has added to its new smartphone and show how they aren't Samsung-style gimmicks that you'll never use. The ad showing off Moto Assist, for instance, shows how you can do voice-enabled hands-free text messaging on your phone while driving your car. Other ads show off the new Moto X's unique new camera features and how the Moto Voice feature gives you voice-enabled commands that are deeply woven into the phone's user experience and not just add-ons that you'll find inconvenient.", "In one of its boldest moves of the year, Samsung released a commercial explaining that the iPhone 6 isn't exactly a fresh idea. In fact, the Galaxy Note 4, Samsung's fourth flagship phablet, is heading to store shelves next month, but Apple wasn't going to let the snark slide by without some form of retaliation. On Tuesday, Apple published a new page on its support site which detailed something many smartphone users are going to need to know this weekend: how to move content from an Android phone to an iPhone 6.\n\nFROM EARLIER: Diehard Android fan explains how Apple convinced him to buy the iPhone 6\n\nFor your email, your contacts and your calendars, there are several ways to transport the data without much hassle.

Photographer Alastair Philip Wiper got the chance to visit Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, the South Korean port where nine of these behemoths are currently being build. These are his amazing photos, originally published on Wired.\n\nAs commissioned by Danish shipping company Maersk lines, a total of 20 of these ships will be made by 2015 in Okpo, South Korea. But that's not the only floating giant under construction at the shipping yard -- in fact, 46,000 people are working on 100 ships right now, which, per Wiper, is an incredible sight to behold! He writes on his blog:\n\nThe Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea is the second largest shipbuilder in the world and one of the \"Big Three\" shipyards of South Korea, along with the Hyundai and Samsung shipyards. The shipyard, about an hour from Busan in the south of the country, employs about 46,000 people, and could reasonably be described as the worlds biggest Legoland. Smiling workers cycle around the huge shipyard as massive, abstractly over proportioned chunks of ships are craned around and set into place: the Triple E is just one small part of the output of the shipyard, as around 100 other vessels including oil rigs are in various stages of completion at the any time.\n\nIt must have been amazing to see in person. It must have been even more amazing to wander around the 18,000 container-capacity ship, which is exactly what Wiper was given permission to do. Check out some of the pics below, or over on Wiper's blog. I feel small. [Alastair Philip Wiper for Wired h/t Gizmodo Es]", "With the launch of Apple's new iPhone 6 and the announcement of the forthcoming Apple Watch, the company signaled its intention to play a major role in how we manage our health. Apple has presented the watch as a fancy fitness tracker and has plugged the iPhone's Health app, which serves as a dashboard for all the user's health and fitness data. The company also created the HealthKit API to allow developers to build apps that share data with the phone's health app.\n\nBut all the buzz hasn't answered the real questions: What will consumers do with all that data? What will iPhone-enabled health care look like?\n\nIt might look a lot like the forthcoming app RevUp, from the San Diego startup MD Revolution. The company's founder, cardiologist Samir Damani, told Spectrum that the app has the potential to really change people's behavior because it combines the data with personalized coaching. \"The data is only as good as what you do with it,\" he says.\n\nRevUp will work with the iPhone's Health app, which pools data from whatever trackers or at-home health devices the customer has synched with it: pedometers, heart rate trackers, blood pressure monitors, and so forth. Based on that data, each RevUp user will receive automated health coaching messages, as well as feedback from a fitness coach, a nutritionist, and a nurse practitioner. Damani says the company has spent three years developing a \"predictive engine\" that correlates data with health outcomes. \"Our platform is geared toward chronic illness prevention and reversal,\" he says.\n\nNext year, the company aims to add genetic data to the mix. MD Revolution is working with a genomics company to provide users with partial genome scans, and will add information about users' genetic variants and possible health vulnerabilities to RevUp. It's unclear how helpful such data will be, however, since medical science is still struggling to understand the role that our genes play in our health.\n\nThe intended customers for RevUp are health care systems that will sign up their patients, and corporations that will use the app in wellness programs for employees. It seems possible, though, that such organizations could get all the health data and management functions they need directly from the iPhone's Health App. It remains to be seen whether RevUp's coaching features will entice institutional customers.\n\nThe company has submitted the app to Apple for approval, but it's also developing an Android version. It's probably a good idea to cover one's bets in this area, since Google and Samsung have both announced platforms that compete directly with Apple's HealthKit. Google Fit offers developers a way to collect and use data from a variety of monitoring devices. Samsung created the SAMI platform to do the same, and is also coming out with a biometric-tracking watch called SimBand. May the best tech giant win!", "You'd think that the next tier above mid tier, is a high-end smartphone, but that's really only the case if you're not talking about Samsung. We've seen the company launch watered down variants of certain smartphones, or new variants of the same phone with higher specs. If the amount of Galaxy phones in the market confuses you, we'll admit it confuses us too, but that won't stop Sammy from bringing on more.\n\nWe have some leaked specifications of the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime, which is definitely not a high-end phone, but will be a tad more powerful than the basic Samsung Galaxy Grand that we already know. We see a 5-inch display with undisclosed resolution, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage according to the specs leaked. Perhaps the only interesting aspect of this phone when compared to its predecessor is that this one sports a 5-megapixel front facing camera, something that could land it into \"selfie phone\" territory.\n\nMost smartphone makers are launching \"selfie phones\" with mid range specifications in order to cater to the teenage market. It seems Samsung's plan is to join the crowd with this device as well.\n\nSource: thegioididong.com\n\nVia: Android Central", "Microsoft has worked hard to ensure that its note taking application stands out from the crowd which is why its the company's priority to be available on every possible platform out there.

Taking notes with this app is very simple. Just download it and start dictating the notes. Users will have to stick with dictation for now as there's no native keyboard in Android Wear.\n\nIn order to take a note on an Android Wear smartwatch simply say out loud \"OK Google, take a note\"and the app will spring up in action to record whatever little flash of genius has crossed your mind.\n\nDo keep in mind though that OneNote for Android Wear requires a smartphone that's powered by Android 4.3 or higher. Popular Android Wear smartwatches available in the market include Motorola Moto 360, Samsung Gear Live and the LG G Watch.", "Last year it was rumored that Samsung's Mobile division was not only cooking up a new Exynos processor for the Galaxy S5 but it was also working on a graphics processor for those chips in-house. The company's new Exynos SoC was launched but it didn't come with Samsung's own GPU. Today the rumor about in-house GPU development has resurfaced. Apparently the company has continued working on those graphics processors and has even been able to bring over engineers from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA and other companies to aid development.\n\nFor mobile graphics Samsung has to rely upon ARM's Mali series of graphics processors which are coupled with its own Exynos series processors. Finally being able to make its own graphics processors would free Samsung from the burden of having to license mobile GPUs from other companies, also eliminating the need to pay a licensing fee.\n\nWith onboard LTE now a feature on Exynos chips the next logical step does seem to be Samsung's own GPU. When that happens the company's power package will be fully homemade. However before Samsung switches to its own GPUs it will ensure that the chip is able to match, if not better, GPUs from other chip makers.\n\nSo it would be unfair to assume right now that Samsung will soon be shifting to in-house designed GPUs in the very near future.

Many users will likely not mind the camera ring, especially considering Apple has gone to great lengths to further improve the camera performance in iPhones, but that doesn't mean Apple is necessarily happy about the compromise it had to make to achieve its new designs.\n\nFROM EARLIER: Here's one important area where some people think the iPhone 6 Plus falls short\n\nIn fact, it turns out that Apple is actively trying to hide the ring as much as possible on its website, Ben Brooks has observed, as the company is suggesting the ring is hardly visible in most marketing images it posted on its iPhone 6 pages. Looking at Apple's design section for the iPhone, you'll notice that all profile pictures of the iPhone 6 do not show the protruding camera lens at all, and there are very few instances where the ring is visible in the other pictures.\n\nFor what it's worth, the iPhone 6 models aren't the first smartphones with protruding cameras.\n\nIn fact, there are many smartphone users old enough to remember that the iPhone 4 (measuring 9.3mm) was declared to be the slimmest smartphone in the United Kingdom in September 2011, not the Galaxy S2, which was slimmer-but-not-quite. While the Galaxy S2 was mostly 8.71mm thin, the device had a protruding rear camera and a bulkier antenna section at the bottom that measured 9.91 mm. Those design \"flaws\" were enough for the U.K. ad authority to rule the iPhone 4 is thinner, but they never stopped Samsung from announcing the handset as the slimmest handset in the world that February.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are Apple's thinnest devices to date, measuring 6.9mm and 7.1mm thick, respectively.\n\nApple has yet to explain (or replace) the marketing images it used on its website.\n\nImages from Apple's website that make the new iPhones' camera ring disappear follow below, with more available on Apple's website.", "The new Apple iOS 8 is seen in this screen grab from the Apple home page.\n\nMonths after Apple first teased iOS 8, the software refresh will be released to iPhone and iPad users on Wednesday.\n\nApple's iOS 8 is being hailed as the biggest operating system release ever because it comes with updates to popular apps, such as messages, photos and the keyboard.\n\nWhile Apple's new gadgets sucked up much of the attention last week, the company also revealed it would release the shiny new iOS update on Wednesday.

It's equal to the capacity of most smartphones.\n\nWho needs it?\n\niPhone 6 Plus and other large screen smartphones and tablets use more power but their batteries remain small and thin for better aesthetics and weight. Users trading up from smaller phones will be surprised by how fast the bigger phones run out of power. The ONE CARD is a must-have for extended use and enjoyment of the new generation phones.\n\nNo Other solutions?\n\niPhones and many other smartphones do not have removable batteries. Cases with batteries add weight and bulk, while changing the design aesthetics. External batteries have long cables and are bulky. Other card chargers have as little as 25% power of the ONE CARD.\n\nOnly ONE CARD has:\n\n-Up to 2-4X the power of other card size chargers, and can charge up to 1% per minute;\n\n-Built-in micro USB (Android) charging cable and Lightning (Apple) adapter;\n\n-Auto on/off, and simultaneous charging of the phone and ONE CARD internal battery;\n\nSpecial Get 2 for $39.99 offer will coincide with the iPhone 6 launch and will end September 30th.\n\nA deal is being finalized to have the ONE CARD in select 7/11 stores before Christmas.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.smartqipower.com/ONECARD.html or Email info@smartqipower.com.\n\n###\n\nAbout Smart Qi Power\n\nSmart Qi Power is an innovator of wireless chargers for Apple and Samsung phones.

Apple's great strength is connecting the dots between several different domains of expertise and then making its technology either beautiful or invisible.\n\nRelated: Why Apple Pay Could Be a Game Changer for Businesses\n\nApple already has the strong backing of the credit-card industry. Credit-card firms want to convert the United States to using chip-on-card readers. So the development of Apple's mobile-payment system may serve as the impetus to help scale the growth of near-field communication (NFC) readers at the same time.\n\nCEO Tim Cook did a great job, showing how easy it is to use Apple Pay as he demonstrated the payment system, saying, \"That's it.\" Apple Pay looks really well designed and the partners Apple has put together are really impressive.\n\nApple has 200,000 retail stores ready to adopt Apple Pay, but there are 2.9 million retail stores in the United States.\n\nDon't confuse vision and aspiration with near-term reality. It's going to take time to fully deploy Apple Pay on a large scale. Apple Pay is a play for the long game and lots of infrastructure must be created before it becomes the game changer that the iPhone became.\n\nApple Pay requires an iPhone 6 with built-in NFC capability. For Apple Pay to work, Apple needs retailers to buy NFC readers. And it will be a while for the iPhone 6's installed customer base to grow large. Apple's worldwide iPhone market share is about 12 percent so how will mobile payments be made by smartphone users without an iPhone 6?\n\nSo great job, Apple, but Samsung and others still have some time to come up with an alternative. Right now there are more Android users (including those relying on Samsung phones) than iPhone users.\n\nWhat can Samsung, or for that matter any other player not in the Apple mobile-payment ecosystem, like PayPal or Google do?\n\nSamsung needs to do something because mobile payments and mobile-oyalty programs offer a huge opportunity.\n\nFor years Samsung expanded its worldwide market share at Apple's expense. Now Apple is changing the ground rules of competition: Apple found a chink in Samsung's armor and is exploiting it.\n\nSo the question now is, Has the Samsung giant become a victim of its own success? Apple didn't blink as Samsung swept up market share. Instead, Apple doubled down on developing its core competence, which lies in shaping new industries by designing beautifully integrated end-to-end systems that rely on a combination of software and hardware trade-offs.\n\nApple is upping its game in a way that may be hard for Samsung to follow. Apple is using the expertise that it's well-known for (in horizontal platforms) to build vertical market platforms that can offer features such as NFC payments, iBeacon customer-loyalty programs, fitness services, streaming music and smart-home technology. (Android and iOS 8 are general purpose horizontal platforms. A vertical platform sits on top of the horizontal platform and has additional special-purpose capabilities specific to a domain like mobile payments.) Horizontal platforms may yet become a commodity technology.\n\nBut it's still the early days of manufacturers' trying to realize big-data vertical platforms on mobile devices.\n\nRelated: Samsung Unveils Next Generation Gear Smartwatches Ahead of Mobile Conference\n\nIn February when Samsung launched its mobile digital watch called Gear 2, many concluded that this admired company may be an emperor with no clothes. Then Samsung made big news while setting high expectations in announcing its Silicon Valley R&D campus. Innovative Silicon Valley firms brag about their technology and services but Samsung chose to boast about its new campus. Hmmm?\n\nHas Samsung been outmaneuvered without a path forward in mobile payments and mobile customer-loyalty services?\n\nNot if Samsung decides to change the rules of competition and take advantage of the millions of retailers still using bar-code and magnetic-striped credit-card readers.\n\nWhen I was Pepsi-Cola's CEO (before serving as Apple's chief), I learned in my \"cola war\" days that the # 2 brand should not compete against the # 1 brand using its rules of the game. That's why in the 1970s Pepsi's managers and I created the Pepsi Challenge, a blind taste test, which helped Pepsi outmaneuver Coca-Cola Co. Then a distant second-tier brand, Pepsi was able to pass Coke to become the largest-selling consumer-packaged goods brand in the States.\n\nSamsung already has Mobeam technology preloaded in millions of Galaxy smartphones. Mobeam is easy to use for electronic coupons.\n\nMobeam is a Silicon Valley company that has commercialized a really simple customer experience that is shaking up the mobile electronic-coupon world. (Full disclosure: I'm a Mobeam investor.) Mobeam technology converts bar-code data into the red pulsing LED light found at the front of most Samsung Galaxy smartphones.\n\nThis simple idea has enabled major consumer-product firms to instantly electronically offer special discounts and coupons to their most loyal customers. All these consumers need to do is aim their smartphone at the checkout scanner.\n\nNote that Mobeam has not implemented mobile payments yet but the technology could be adapted to do payments. Retailers already have optical scanners that can read bar codes. Mobeam can work with the existing installed base of one-dimensional optical scanners.\n\nAs marketers know, the most important goal is keeping customers in an ecosystem and make them very, very happy.", "This is an increasing important and not fully resolved legal issue which should logically be addressed in the pending Fed. Cir. appeal of the nearly $1 billion infringement damages award in Apple v. Samsung, re the Apple design patents held infringed. That award seems to have inspired increased design patent assertions and design application filings. In that case Judge Koh had even called the application of the Supreme Courts controlling KSR decision on \u00a7103 an \"open question\" as to design patents! Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Case No.: II-CV-01846-LHK, Slip Op. at 19 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2011). These issues could also arise soon in PTO IPR PTAB decision appeals to the Fed. Cir. The PTAB has already issued a final written decision in the first IPR against a design patent. Munchkin, Inc. and Toys \"R\" US, Inc. v. Luv N' Care, Ltd, IPR 2013-00072 (Paper No. 28) (April 21, 2014).\n\nIn contrast to utility patent litigation, in design patent litigation summary judgments for non-infringement are relatively rare, while summary judgments for \u00a7103 obviousness are more common. This is so even though they have the very same \u00a7103. Yet the Supreme Court's controlling \u00a7103 guidelines in KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc, 550 U. S. 398 (2007) have been strangely totally ignored or not applied in many subsequent design cases. Instead, unique old Fed. Cir. case law is still being applied in making \u00a7103 design prior art comparisons and combinations, as discussed below. Perhaps this reportedly high rate of design patent \u00a7103 summary judgments logically correlates with the prior study and report on this blog at: http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2010/01/design-patent-rejections.html showing that design patent applications are issued with only rare \u00a7103 rejections by PTO design patent application examiners? That is, prior art is rarely being applied at the examination stage. Again, this is opposite from PTO utility patent application examination, even though under the very same \u00a7103 standard. A recent example of a Fed. Cir. sustained \u00a7103 summary judgment of two design patents in suit isMRC Innovations v. Hunter Mfg. (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n\nIs another reason for relatively less non-infringement than \u00a7103 summary judgments in design patent cases due in part to the usual absence of any verbal claim distinctions, plus the Egyptian Goddess \"ordinary observer\" test? The \"ordinary observer\" test for designpatent infringement must also be contrasted with the traditional judicial view of design patent \"claims scope\" as narrow - see, e.g., cases cited in the article \"Functionality and Design Patent Validity and Infringement\", 91 Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office Society (JPTOS) 313, May, 2009, by Perry J. Saidman of the DesignLaw Group. But is the scope of design patents now being treated consistently with the black-letter case law that claims in litigation must have the same scope for infringement and validity? Is there a problem with lack of legal guidance of how prior art is to be treated in defining a design patent's claim scope for, or before, an \"ordinary observer\" infringement test? [It has been argued that this was a jury instruction defect in the above Apple decision.]\n\nIn what seems like a remarkably begrudging semi-admission [which may be due to its particular panel members], the panel in Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland, Inc. 566 F.3d 1372, (Fed. Cir. 2009) said that \"it is not obvious that the Supreme Court necessarily intended to exclude design patents from the reach of KSR.\" However even this Fed. Cir. panel held that: \"Our precedents teach that 'the ultimate inquiry under section 103 is whether the claimed design would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill who designs articles of the type involved.' Durling v. Spectrum Furniture Co., 101 F.3d 100, 103 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citing In re Rosen, 673 F.2d 388, 390 (CCPA 1982)).\"\n\nYet the patent statute at \u00a7171 is perfectly clear that design patents have the very same \u00a7103 as other patents. \u00a7103 requires \"..that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious .. to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains\" [emphasis supplied]. For design patents that has to be a person having ordinary skill in the art of industrial product design, not the non-skill level of any lay person, such as a jury member. [This \u00a7103 requirement should, of course, not be confused with a \u00a7102 novelty test.]\n\nThe prior en banc Federal Circuit \"Egyptian Goddess\" decision on design patent infringement, Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v. Swisa, Inc. 543 F.3d 665 (Fed. Cir. 2008), notes, just after referring to \"the hypothetical ordinary observer who is conversant with the prior art\" test fordesign patent infringement, that: \"We emphasize that although the approach we adopt will frequently involve comparisons between the claimed design and the prior art, it is not a test for determining validity, but is designed solely as a test of infringement.\" Unfortunately this en banc Egyptian Goddess decision did not clarify that statement further.\n\nIn High Point Design LLC v. Buyers Direct, Inc., (Fed. Cir. 2013) a Fed. Cir. panel had to face up to the District Court below having been mislead by one of the Court's own prior design patent decisions, and had to re-clarify its \u00a7103 \"obvious to whom\" case law. Key text in this High Point Design decision includes:\n\nThe use of an \"ordinary observer\" standard to assess the potential obviousness of a design patent runs contrary to the precedent of this court and our predecessor court, under which the obviousness of a design patent must, instead, be assessed from the viewpoint of an ordinary designer. See Apple, 678 F.3d at 1329 (\"In addressing a claim of obviousness in a design patent, 'the ultimate inquiry . is whether the claimed design would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill who designs articles of the type involved.'\") (quoting Durling, 101 F.3d at 103); Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland, Inc., 566 F.3d 1372, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (same); In re Borden, 90 F.3d 1570, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\"The central inquiry in analyzing an ornamental design for obviousness is whether the design would have been obvious to 'a designer of ordinary skill who designs articles of the type involved.'\") ..\n\nAlthough High Point Design cites prior Fed. Cir. decisions which note \u00a7103, its does not base the decision directly on this controlling statute, as it could and should have! Instead, this High Point Design footnote 2 below unsuccessfully attempts to explain-away a priorconflicting, erroneous \"ordinary observer\" invalidity test decision, but ends up by noting that it cannot, in any event, overrule even earlier Fed. Cir. decisions:\n\nWe do not believe our decision in International Seaway Trading Corp. v. Walgreens Corp., 589 F.3d 1233, 1240 (Fed. Cir. 2009), cited by the district court, compelsa contrary conclusion. The International Seaway court may in fact have had the \"designer of ordinary skill\" standard in mind when it used the term \"ordinary observer.\" In any event, the court could not rewrite precedent setting forth the designer of ordinary skill standard. See Vas Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Newell Cos., Inc. v. Kenney Mfg. Co., 864 F.3d 757, 765 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n\nHowever, High Point Design still leaves another important unresolved \u00a7103 issue for design patents, one serious enough that it may end up in another Supreme Court challenge if the Fed. Cir. does not address it. I have labeled this the \"as compared to what\"? question. Because High Point Design does not even mention KSR and instead continues to apply an additional and unique \"obviousness\" analysis requirement for design patents from old pre-KSR case law. An additional requirement that is not in \u00a7103 and does not seem consistent with KSR or even some other \u00a7103 combination of references case law. Specifically, High Point Design states:\n\nWhen assessing the potential obviousness of a design patent, a finder of fact employs two distinct steps: first, \"one must find a single reference, a something in existence, the design characteristics of which are basically the same as the claimed design\"; second, \"[o]nce this primary reference is found, other references may be used to modify it to create a design that has the same overall visual appearance as the claimed design.\" Durling v. Spectrum Furniture Co., 101 F.3d 100, 103 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (internal quotations omitted); see also Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 678 F.3d 1314, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Under the first step, a court must both \"(1) discern the correct visual impression created by the patented design as a whole; and (2) determine whether there is a single reference that creates 'basically the same' visual impression.\" Durling, 101 F.3d at 103.\"\n\nAnother way in which this above unique old special \u00a7103 test for design patents is sometimes expressed is a requirement to \"first find a Rosen reference\" (In re Leon Rosen, 673 F.2d 388, 391 (CCPA 1982)). [That may be quite difficult in some cases.] Note particularly the above High Point requirements for first finding a single reference that has \"basically the same\" design characteristics and visual impression, and only modifying it with other references to create \"the same overall visual appearance.\" Does that seem appropriate for a normal \u00a7103 analysis? Does this old judicially created \u00a7103 analysis for design patents not significantly reduce \u00a7103-usable or combinable prior art? How is that consistent with the controlling Sup. Ct. KSR \u00a7103 guidance for combining references, completely ignored in High Point Design? Has anyone suggested any reason why KSR does not apply to design patent \u00a7103 analysis?\n\nIn this respect, here are some specific \u00a7103-KSR issues to consider. Is not the designing of costly consumer products intended to be sold by the millions [like smart phones] an \"art\" in which the \u00a7103 \"ordinary skill\" level of product designers would be expected to be especially high? Furthermore, do not professional product designers normally work on many different products and use product appearance design ideas from many different fields and products, far more than for utililty patents? To express that another way, should not \"non-analogous art\" arguments against combining art for a 103 rejection be even less effective for design patents after KSR than for utility patents?\n\n* * * * *\n\nI have no stake in any of these interesting legal issues. I simply think members and professional organizations of the patent bar as well as legal academics should be doing more pro bono thinking about them. Hopefully the Federal Circuit will provide clearer guidance in future decisions.", "PhoneDog Media ExclusiveDownload iM5, now available in the App Store and Google Play. iM5 is a PhoneDog Media backed Social Platform to inspire real-life action through the crowdsourcing of ideas. See the video\n\nThere are days when I miss when it took manufacturers a healthy stretch of time to create a proper sequel to a device. Sure, they released other handsets, sometimes just as good as what came before, but the sequel to a handset that you loved usually always stood out. And, sometimes, the release corresponded with your two-year upgrade date, if you were lucky. Release dates may not have been so obvious back then, but at least you had time with a device because the successor wasn't potentially coming out six months later.\n\nNow that we're firmly in the years where the yearly refresh is an actual thing, and seeing successors to devices come out sometimes even before that yearly target, keeping a phone for a shorter length of time is now more common than ever. Of course, it helps that carriers are bending to the idea of monthly installment plans for devices. With these, it's easier than ever to trade in a device that you've been paying monthly payments for, and get a new handset and pay monthly installments on that device moving forward.\n\nNot including T-Mobile, the carriers are still likely to try and get you to pick up a two-year contract if you're on the fence between the two options, but at least there are options now.\n\nAnd it isn't like there aren't devices to upgrade to every year. The manufacturers out there are never satisfied with what they have on the market for too long, so the next great thing is always on the horizon. And why shouldn't it be? With devices like LG's G3, HTC's One (M8), Motorola's new Moto X, Apple's iPhone 6, and Samsung's Galaxy Note 4, the list is still growing of great handsets you can buy in 2014 (or will be able to soon).\n\nBut, as many have caught on to over the years, sometimes upgrading every year isn't all that worth it, especially if you're still a fan of the device you've been using for months already. Or, perhaps more accurately, the older device isn't breaking on you.\n\nMore than that, I've seen so many times recently people asking, \"Is it worth the upgrade?\" These folks usually point out that they've got the previous year's version, and looking at the new handset just doesn't spring to life any real desire or need to upgrade just yet.\n\nThere are people out there that buy a phone just because it's new, and they want it. And I'm not even talking about early adopters. With the option to easily upgrade every year now, they're going to take advantage of it. And, let's face it, neither option is wrong. If you want to wait, or if you want to get all the phones every year, whatever works for you is the right way to go.\n\nI'm just curious: Do you upgrade every year? Specifically, do you often upgrade from one version of a device to the next year's successor? Or do you wait an extra year to make sure you get the best bang for your buck? Let me know!", "The Hawks -- and Atlanta at large -- face big questions that have little to do with the on-court product.\n\nYou think the Clippers had some work to do with their community after the Sterling business?\n\nYou think the Minnesota Vikings had to make amends with their fans and ticket base after several of their players were discovered on what soon became known as \"The Love Boat?\"\n\nYou think it was easy for (insert Major League team here) to explain to a skeptical audience that the games they won weren't because the majority -- or at least a plurality -- of their players were juicing?\n\nIf you aren't in crisis mode at one time or another as a pro sports franchise, you aren't trying.\n\nAnd so the Atlanta Hawks begin this morning the long climb back to respectability, after a week of increasingly awful tales involving ownership and the team's general manager, now on a leave of absence that was as voluntary as the Army was back in 1942.\n\nThe damage done by Bruce Levenson's e-mail and Danny Ferry's conference call could take years to repair. The Hawks were already an enigma, a team in a Top 10 market, with a strong African-American middle class and numerous Fortune 400 companies within blocks of Philips Arena (including former owner Time Warner, which owns Turner Sports), yet unable to put a product on the floor that was entertaining and/or elite level. Good and occasionally very good players have come through Atlanta, but the truth is, the Hawks haven't had a superstar player on their roster since Dominique Wilkins.\n\nThe past two summers have been a major bust for the Hawks, who've watched as superstar after superstar hasn't even come close to sniffing the big dollars that Ferry loosened up by sending Joe Johnson's Enormo-Contract to Brooklyn two summers ago. Now, the task of luring difference-making free agents is that much harder.\n\nEven Carmelo Anthony, who famously said a couple of years ago that modern day players were reluctant to make \"Ali-type statements\" for fear of alienating sponsors, had a clear voice last week when he said that prominent free agents would be reluctant to sign with Atlanta in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt was all so avoidable.\n\nNo, GMs don't read or edit every scouting report that comes their way before putting it in their respective Draft/Free Agency books. But for Ferry to not think enough to adlib around a passage so odious before uttering it boggles the mind.\n\n\"You know how much you wash those reports before you go to the owners?\" a longtime NBA executive said over the weekend. \"Ownership never gets all the unfiltered information. And never on a conference call, when you don't know who's on the other end. And you don't know who's on there. They could have their friends in there.\"\n\nSpeaking of which: I hate to be the skunk in the flower garden, or the traffic cop slowing the parade down East 9th Street. But it's obvious by reading the infamous report that Ferry read from (take a look for yourself) that the infamous phrase in question was written by someone who used to be in the Cavaliers' organization. I say used to be because the subhead in front of the redacted name says \"Former\" before the report begins.\n\nNote the key sentence in the paragraph before the \"African\" sentence: \"From a physical when we got him [emphasis mine], Chicago had run him into the ground.\" The Bulls traded Deng to the Cavaliers for Andrew Bynum on Jan. 6, 2014. Deng hadn't played for anyone other than Chicago since being acquired by the Bulls in a Draft night deal with Phoenix in 2004. The report is dated June 6, well before the start of free agency (Deng subsequently signed with Miami). That report has to be from someone who, until recently (if the \"former\" subhead is accurate), worked with the Cavs.\n\nAnd thus, if true, one wonders what LeBron James and all the other folks who have come to Cleveland in that city's otherwise glorious summer believe about the organization they are joining, where someone who just finished working there feels comfortable writing of Deng, \"He's a good guy on the cover but he's an African.\" There is another shoe yet to drop here, and it is likely to drop soon.\n\nIn the interim, there remain unanswered questions in Atlanta:\n\n* CEO Steve Koonin said Friday that coach Mike Budenholzer will run the player personnel side during Ferry's absence. But who will approve/disapprove Budenholzer's requests? Will it be Koonin, who just got to the team from Time Warner? Will it be one of the team's minority owners, including Michael Gearon, Jr., who disclosed the Ferry conference call? A combination of them?\n\nThe Hawks have positioned themselves to be major players next summer in free agency if they choose. All-Star Paul Millsap's two-year, $19 million deal expires then, as does swingman DeMarre Carroll's contract. Atlanta has no guaranteed money on its books past the 2016-17 season; the Hawks, literally, have a clean slate. Who will paint it in?\n\n* How long will Koonin take before deciding whether Ferry's leave of absence will end, or become permanent? Ferry will be meeting with African-American leaders in the community during his leave and undergo sensitivity training. But given the anger felt by so many in the African-American community in Atlanta, how can Ferry be welcomed back, no matter how productive the leave of absence?\n\nThe shame of it is that Ferry had put together a first-class coaching staff.\n\nBudenholzer's bona fides were beyond reproach, having been as intimately involved in the San Antonio Spurs' philosophy and talent acquisition over the last two decades as anyone not named Gregg Popovich or R.C. Buford. Budenholzer carried the Spurs' development genes with him to Atlanta. The Hawks have outstanding assistant coaches in Darvin Ham and Kenny Atkinson, who helped transform guys like Millsap into multi-dimensional players.\n\nThe Hawks hired former Austin Toros head coach Taylor Jenkins last year as an assistant, brought in a young up-and-comer named Charles Lee from Bucknell University this summer and last month hired Neven Spahlja, a Croatian coach with 25 years of coaching experience.\n\nIt will be imperative, of course, that the Hawks' next ownership and management group be more like the coaching staff in terms of diversity. It doesn't mean the owner has to be a woman or African-American, or the GM (if Ferry weren't to return) be a person of color. But something has to give.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported over the weekend that Doug Davis, a music industry attorney and the son of legendary record producer Clive Davis, wants to put a group together to make a bid for the team. He won't be alone: Koonin will have to beat the hedge fund guys off with a stick.\n\nAnd these names could certainly come up in the weeks to come:\n\nLarry Ellison. Mr. Oracle is always on the lookout for an NBA team, having bid on the Golden State Warriors and New Orleans Pelicans (nee Hornets) in recent years. He passed on getting involved with the L.A. Clippers, and he's always looking to move a team to the Sacramento-Bay Area corridor. A new owner would have to pay a reported $75 million in early termination fees if he wanted to move the team before the 2018-19 season, along with $120 million the team borrowed from the NBA's loan program in 2010.\n\nDoes Ellison -- currently worth $50.3 billion, and the fifth-richest person in the world, according to Forbes, have that kind of scratch? Most certainly. But Ellison has never been one to overpay just to have a team. He didn't try to top Joe Lacob and Peter Guber at Golden State once they bid $450 million for the Warriors. It's likely Gearon and the other minority owners can match any offer from any prospective owner who would want to move the team. And it's unlikely the NBA would sign off on a deal that allows the Hawks to leave a city where Coca Cola, among other behemoths, and its kajillion dollars are so close by.\n\nArthur Blank. The Home Depot co-founder already owns the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, where he has shown a willingness to spend to build a contending team. This would follow the Tom Benson model. He rescued the New Orleans Pelicans, buying them from the NBA for $338 million two years ago while owning the NFL's Saints.\n\nTony Ressler, Bruce Karsh and Grant Hill. The trio teamed up to make a real bid for the Clippers -- $1.2 billion -- before Steve Ballmer blew everyone away with his $2 billion offer. But the league was impressed with the work. Ressler and Karsh already have toes in the pro sports water -- Ressler is a minority owner of the Milwaukee Brewers; Karsh has a small stake in the Golden State Warriors -- and Hill knows Karsh from Karsh's serving on the Board of Trustees at Duke. (Ressler brings his own star power to the group, being married to the actress Jami Gertz.)\n\nThe league couldn't have a more contrasting, uplifting group to the Hawks' current mess of ownership than to show Atlanta a new group with Hill out front in a managerial capacity.\n\nJim Kennedy. An heir to the Atlanta-based Cox media empire, the 66-year-old Kennedy is worth a cool $8 billion, according to Forbes. The chairman of Cox Enterprises is getting even richer as the family owns a large stake of AutoTrader.com. And Cox already has an ancillary business arrangement with the Hawks ... something called Experience. It is a live events ticket company that allows patrons to upgrade seats while at an arena using their phone. The company is used by the Hawks and several other NBA teams and was founded by Tripp Rackley, a member of Cox's Board of Trustees.\n\nMost of us thought it would take months, if not a year or more, for the league to get the Clippers out of the Sterling family. Ballmer made it easier by offering so much money that even Donald Sterling had to slow his complaints and conspiracies to a whisper. You'd think it shouldn't take that long to find a buyer in Atlanta that can start to stabilize a franchise shook to its foundations.\n\n\"We've been corroded from within,\" a source said over the weekend.\n\nThe mind, as always, was willing. The flesh, as ever, had its own thoughts.\n\nAnd thus one of the great playing careers in recent memory ended last week, with Chauncey Billups announcing his retirement at age 37 (he will turn 38 on Sept. 25).\n\n\"Mr. Big Shot\" is healthier than he's been in years, and mentally, he was game to try an 18th season. But his body is telling him it's time. He wanted to get out when he was healthy enough to live long and productively long after he was done playing.\n\n\"It's been tough these last three years, pretty much after the Achilles',\" Billups said late Sunday night, referring to the Achilles' tear he suffered early in the 2011-12 season with the Clippers, just weeks after the end of the lockout.\n\n\"You fight back hard, you grind and grind, and I got back to a point where I thought I was good,\" he said. \"But then something else came up that wasn't related to the Achilles' came up, but maybe it was. It was just tough. The competitor in me, it's kind of hard to just sit there when you know what you can really do. You sit there in a suit and do what you can, but it's not really fulfilling.\"\n\nSo Billups will have to make do with his 2004 NBA championship and NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award, his five All-Star appearances and his seven straight appearances in the Eastern Conference finals with the Pistons.\n\n\"I don't know how his career will be viewed in total, by the Hall of Fame and people like that,\" his former Pistons coach, Rick Carlisle, said Saturday. \"But having coached him, and coached against him, he was a great player. And I don't use that term great loosely. He was tremendous.\"\n\nWhat is most amazing about the career of the man who became synonymous with clutch shooting and leadership is that it was so close to not blossoming at all. But for chance and a handful of people who saw something in him when others didn't, Billups may have well wound up a journeyman, always lamenting what didn't happen.\n\nThe first five years of Billups' career were marred by injuries and uncertainty.\n\nHe was part of Boston's consolation prize when, despite having the league's second-worst record in 1996-97, and with two lottery picks in hand, it didn't get the top pick in '97 and lost out on Tim Duncan. Boston instead got the third and sixth picks, and took Billups third overall (Ron Mercer went sixth).\n\n\"Most third picks in the draft, at that stage, they're going to be with that team six, seven, eight years,\" Billups said. \"I didn't think nothing different. Going to the Boston Celtics, a storied franchise like that, I'm thinking I'm going to play, learn, play through my mistakes and be allowed to learn from my mistakes and get better. I learned quickly that that wasn't the case. It was a humbling experience.\"\n\nWhat should have been a star turn with a star coach, Rick Pitino, lasted just 51 games into Billups' rookie season. Pitino, who had full control over personnel in Boston, traded Billups to Toronto in a seven-player deal featuring Kenny Anderson. It was the first of many times that teams were uncertain about Billups' ideal position. In addition, Pitino told Billups he was under tremendous pressure to win right away.\n\nBut Billups saw the silver lining in the trade. Anderson, at the time, was viewed as a top talent and one of the better point guards in the league (he had gotten $49 million over seven years in 1996 from Portland). Somebody saw Billups had some value.\n\n\"I simply wasn't quite wasn't ready yet,\" Billups said. \"But that doesn't mean I wouldn't be.\"\n\nToronto was no better for Billups; the Raptors had just changed coaches when he arrived, replacing Darrell Walker with Butch Carter, and were in the midst of running 24 players through town that season -- from an 18-year-old Tracy McGrady to 33-year-old Bob McCann. The Raptors then got Vince Carter in a Draft night trade with Golden State, and opted to build around Carter and McGrady.\n\nCarter let Billups bump his head a few times and get some experience at the point. Billups was still superfluous, though, and was sent to his next stop, Denver, in January of 1999 -- the day after the lockout ended. It should have been a glorious time for Billups, who had starred in Denver at George Washington High and been second team AP All-America at Colorado.\n\nBut Billups didn't really want to go home; he liked it in Toronto, and the Nuggets had the worst record in the league. He made it through the lockout-shortened season for a young, first-year head coach named Mike D'Antoni. But the Nuggets had brought in a still-productive Nick Van Exel to run the point, and Antonio McDyess at power forward. Those two were going to have the ball most of the time.\n\nD'Antoni started Billups at shooting guard, but 13 games into his second season with the Nuggets, he separated his shoulder after the Kings' Peja Stojakovic fell on it. Billups missed the rest of the season. The Nuggets didn't wait for him to get healthy and traded him in February of 2000 to Orlando in a multi-player deal featuring Chris Gatling and Tariq Abdul-Wahad.\n\nThat deal shook Billups. He decided that he could no longer depend on the letters on the front of the jersey, as that had proven to be somewhat malleable, depending on the whims of people he could not control. What he could control was how the name on the back of the jersey performed. So that became his task. He never played a second for the Magic, which moved that summer to sign McGrady and Grant Hill as its new one-two punch, renouncing Billups to help create the cap room necessary for the two max contracts.\n\n\"I can't help Orlando or Denver,\" he recalled thinking. \"That was probably rock bottom at the time. I can't play for neither one of y'all, nobody. All I can do is rehab, and you still throw me to the wolves?\"\n\nThe Wolves, though, wound up saving Billups' career. The Minnesota wing.\n\nKevin Garnett, one of Billups' best friends, chirped in his ear all summer to come up to the Twin Cities. The Timberwolves had a young superstar in KG, and crafty vets like Sam Mitchell as mentors. Terrell Brandon was running the point, and Anthony Peeler was starting at shooting guard, but Minnesota wanted someone who could spell both of them. So Billups signed with the Timberwolves in the summer of 2000.\n\nDuring his first season in Minnesota, he primarily came off the bench. But the following season, he became the Wolves' starter.\n\n\"We brought him in and he was initially our third guard,\" the Wolves past and present coach, Flip Saunders, said. \"We had TB at the time and TB always had a tendency to get hurt. We played him at both the one and the two and we started surviving and playing better. And then, Terrell got hurt. We started starting [Billups] at the one.\"\n\nThe Timberwolves made the playoffs a second straight season with Billups in 2002. The previous year, he played a total of 26 minutes in three playoff games. In '02, he averaged 22 points per game against the Mavericks in the postseason, shooting 40 percent on 3-pointers. It was a turning point, even though Minnesota went out in three straight games to Dallas in the first round.\n\n\"All year long I had some big, big stretches, played well against the best point guards in the league,\" Billups said. \"Overall, we wasn't on TV all that much. People seen the numbers, but they didn't see what I was really doing. But that playoff series, of course, that series was big, playing against Steve Nash, one of the best point guards in the league at that time, I played well, I held my own. We got swept, but people were like, OK, here he comes. That's him.\"\n\nAfter his second season in Minnesota, Billups was, again, a free agent. The Wolves had committed $60 million to Brandon through 2005. There wasn't much choice. Billups signed as a free agent with the Pistons.\n\n\"Chauncey, it was one of those things,\" Saunders says now. \"I told him, I can't guarantee you that you'll start or not start. It didn't really surprise me that Detroit came after him, based on the way he'd played against Dallas.\"\n\nIt wasn't surprising that the Pistons signed Billups. It was shocking to many around the league that the Pistons gave Billups the full mid-level exception at the time: six years and $35 million.\n\n\"I was happy to get that mid-level,\" he said. \"I was going back and forth with my agent the whole time. He wanted me to go four years, get out after three. I was like 'No. The way my career's been going, I don't want to take any chances. I want to get all the years I can get.'\"\n\nThe Pistons had no doubt they'd make the right call. General Manager Joe Dumars and Carlisle were in sync. The Pistons had acquired Ben Wallace from Orlando as part of the sign-and-trade deal that sent Hill to the Magic -- which had to renounce Billups in order to make the deal work. They took a quiet, ridiculously long small forward in the first round of the 2002 Draft named Tayshaun Prince, and they were about to get a young Rip Hamilton from Washington for Jerry Stackhouse. They just needed someone to make it all fit together.\n\n\"Joe and I did a lot of homework, and we just really believed this guy was really untapped as a player, that had a real chance he could grow to great heights, and he didn't disappoint,\" Carlisle said. \"If you watched enough film on him, he had a quarterback's mentality. Even though he could score, he could definitely run a team, definitely be an aggressive scorer and a guy that could keep a real pulse on keeping everybody else involved.\"\n\nThey didn't believe Billups' past problems with injuries were the issue holding him back.\n\n\"Moreso than the injuries, it just seemed like Chauncey was always splitting the position with someone else,\" Dumars said Saturday. \"OK, you know, if you just hand him the ball and allow him to run his own team, how much more can you get out of him? That's what I was looking at, more than the injuries ... I think if you give this kid the ball and just give him the ball and let him run the team, I think he could be really, really good.\"\n\nCarlisle met with Billups the first day of free agency and offered him the full boat.\n\n\"Rick flew out the first day, and he was honest with me,\" Billups recalled. \"He said, 'We need a point guard. We won 50 games last year. We had the Defensive Player of the Year in Ben Wallace and the Sixth Man of the Year in Corliss Williamson.' The point guard we had at the time, Chucky Atkins, they loved Chucky.\n\n\"But Rick was honest. There was three guys they were interested in: Travis Best, myself and Jeff McInnis. He said, 'I like those guys, too. I'm not telling you you're the best thing since airplanes. But I think you're ready, and I promise you, you'll get an opportunity if you come to Detroit.' That's all I needed to hear; that somebody believed in me the way I believed in me.\"\n\nSaid Dumars: \"When he came in with us, I said a couple of things. One, we're going to give you the ball. It's your team. Second, you're a point guard. We're not going to play you at the two, and we're not going to play you as a combo.' He said, 'That's all I need.' \"\n\nIt was a huge gamble. But the Pistons jelled quickly with their new point guard, who averaged 16.2 points per game his first season in Detroit.\n\n\"Nobody had given that responsibility and privilege to him,\" Carlisle said. \"When we did, he understood the responsibility involved. He took to it very quickly. He proved a lot of people wrong. There were a heck of a lot more people that didn't think he could do it than did.\"\n\nDetroit made the Eastern finals, but got swept by a powerful New Jersey team led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin. If Billups hadn't severely sprained an ankle in the conference semis against the Philadelphia 76ers ... who knows? But the Pistons had made their mark as the heir apparent in the East.\n\n\"I didn't know we would win a 'chip that first year, but I did think we had a lot of like-minded guys who liked to play both ends of the court,\" Billups said. \"Ain't nobody that was too old. We had some aging veterans like Cliff Robinson and Corliss, but they didn't have to carry the team. I knew, two, three days into training camp, that this was it. I was blessed to be in that position.\"\n\nThat season is also how Billups got his nickname.\n\n\"We start off the season, and we're playing good,\" he said. \"What Carlisle's doing is, he's splitting time with myself and Chucky. I'm playing first and third, and he's playing Chucky in the second and fourth. About 20 games go by and I'm saying, this isn't really what we're talking about. I go to him and talk. I said, don't know any starters who start the game and don't play in the fourth. He said, 'I understand, Chauncey. But I have so much history with Chucky, and he makes so many big shots at the end of the game.' I said, 'Well, you only know me from last year, but that's what I do, too.' And at the time, Chucky was clutch. And he was like, 'Chauncey, you're absolutely right. I'm gonna get better at that.' \"\n\n\"And for the next two weeks, we have all these close games. And I hit four buzzer beaters. Four. And after one of them, the next morning, I close the door and I'm like, 'I told you.' And you know Rick, he don't never get too crazy.' He said, 'You're right, I apologize.' I said, 'I don't want your apology, I just wanted the opportunity.'\"\n\nAfter the conference finals defeat, the Pistons stunned everyone again. They fired Carlisle, who'd just gone 50-32 in back-to-back seasons and won NBA Coach of the Year honors in 2002. They brought in the mercurial Larry Brown to replace him, to get the team over the hump -- and, to refine Billups. No one had a better -- or, worse, depending on who you talked with -- reputation for improving (or, again, messing with, depending on who you talked with) point guards than Brown.\n\nBillups, though, had an open mind.\n\n\"In college, I played for David Moe, Doug Moe's son,\" Billups said. \"He always told me, 'Chaunce, you really need to play for Larry Brown one day.' I would always say, 'Why?' So I would go and look him up. You always hear how hard he was on point guards, and so I was like, maybe this is somebody I can learn from. When they brought him in I called Coach Moe [whose father played with Brown at North Carolina] and said, 'You better be right.'\n\nHe was.\n\nThe first day of training camp, Brown stopped the play, if not every time, every other time down the floor. It was his MO. In Philly, Allen Iverson had railed at Brown's attempts to reshape and mold his game. Billups took to it easier.\n\nThere were growing pains, to be sure. Brown had had pass-first point guards like Mark Jackson, Best and Eric Snow in recent years. Billups was a scoring point. Brown hated point guards taking 3-pointers. Billups loved shooting them. But they agreed a lot more than they disagreed.\n\n\"The team, at some point, is going to take on the personality of that coach,\" Billups said. \"Larry was very businesslike. He wasn't rah-rah. He coached me and Rip and Ben harder than anybody else on the team, from the preseason on. That never changed. I appreciated that. And not only is his personality like that, so is mine. And that's why our team's personality was the same way.\"\n\nRiding the same cast, the Pistons were rolling through the regular season when Dumars took a chance on what he thought would be the final piece: the up-to-that-point-seemingly-off-center Rasheed Wallace. Wallace had run afoul of referees and most of his coaches during his days in Portland. But he was the exact right piece in Detroit: a guy who desperately wanted to be one of the guys, who could space the floor with his shooting and give Billups and Hamilton room, and who would defend multiple positions.\n\nWith Ben and Rasheed Wallace commanding the paint, Prince wreaking havoc on the perimeter and Billups and backup point guard Lindsey Hunter ballhawking for 48 minutes, Detroit became a historically stingy defense, becoming the first team in league history to hold five straight opponents under 70 points.\n\nDetroit rolled through the East, only to face a L.A. Lakers team going for a fourth title in five years. With Karl Malone and Gary Payton having joined Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles looked invincible most of the season. The Lakers made quick work of Houston, San Antonio and Minnesota in the playoffs, and were prohibitive favorites against Detroit.\n\nBut the Pistons were supremely confident. Before Game 1 of The Finals, Brown echoed in practice what Billups already knew: The Lakers were imploding, the civil war between Shaq and Kobe at its worst.\n\n\"I told everybody before the series, we're going to win this series, and it ain't even gonna be that hard,\" Billups said. \"I watched the way they played. I watched the selfishness they played with. And we were the polar opposite. We're gonna be locked in on defense, and we're gonna be locked in every single time. And offensively, you don't know who it's going to be every night. You can't just guard Rip on a pindown.\"\n\nThe idea was to put O'Neal in pick and rolls throughout the series, to get him out of the paint. The only way to pull that off was for Billups to attack all game.\n\nHe never took more than 15 shots in any of the five Finals games. But Billups lived at the foul line, shooting 39 of 42 (92.9 percent). He averaged 21 points and 5.2 assists and was the easy choice for Finals MVP, raising the roof at the Palace of Auburn Hills on a hot, hot July night. It was Shaq's last game as a Laker. It was Billups' moment of a lifetime -- a moment that, so many times, was close to never happening.\n\n\"Five years, five different teams, basically traded five times, and you see something in a guy like that and he makes it happen,\" Dumars said. \"That's the ultimate in these positions of running teams, to find that untapped guy that hasn't done it yet. And he certainly was that guy for us.\"\n\nThe rest, you probably know: another Finals appearance, a seven-game loss to the Spurs in '05, three more Eastern finals through 2008 for Saunders, who replaced Brown, and then, the falling action. He was traded back to Denver in 2008 for Iverson as the Pistons' reign was ending, and led the Nuggets to two strong seasons and a West finals berth in 2009. He went to New York in 2011 in the Carmelo Anthony deal, got amnestied by the Knicks so they could sign Tyson Chandler, and, lastly, played 42 games over two seasons with the Clippers and 19 games with the Pistons last season.\n\nAll of a sudden, you're 37 with a bad wheel.\n\nBut Billups goes out with no regrets. He will have his pick of announcing jobs if he so chooses, and the Wolves tried hard this summer to lure him as an assistant. Billups also has front office aspirations. The basketball world is his oyster, a man who can talk with anybody (\"I guarantee you he's probably got more numbers of players in his phone than anybody in the NBA,\" Saunders said) and be forceful without being a jerk.\n\nWhat a long, strange trip it's been.\n\n\"The MVP thing never crossed my mind,\" Billups said. \"I never shot for that. I was never going to for that. Just the fact that I was a point guard and I was leading my team to the championship of the NBA, that was what was big for me. Just what I had been through, everybody throwing me in the trash, saying he's not going to be this or that, all of that was going through my mind. I was going to thank so many people up there, but I thought, I'm gonna keep it classy tonight. I was just happy to validate to the world what I thought about myself.\"\n\nDoes the NBA have anything to learn from the Janay Palmer tragedy?\n\nThat is the exact right word, by the way. It's a tragedy, what happened to Janay Palmer, now Janay Palmer Rice, at the hands of her then-fiance, the then-Baltimore Ravens running back, Ray Rice, in an elevator at Revel Casino in Atlantic City last February -- when Ray Rice, as the couple was arguing, knocked Janay Palmer out cold with a punch to her head.\n\nIt is not a tragedy that, all these months later, after all the obfuscating and excuse making, Ray Rice was finally indefinitely suspended by the NFL and released from his contract by the Ravens. He did that to himself, the minute he decided to use the woman he loves for target practice.\n\nBut no league is immune, and while the NFL is in the spotlight today, that hasn't always been the case. Several NBA players have been involved in domestic violence incidents in recent years. The latest involved former No. 1 overall pick Greg Oden, who was arrested last month in Indianapolis after allegedly punching his ex-girlfriend in the face three times. He faces one felony count of battery and two misdemeanor counts.\n\nAnd the NBA, like everyone else, has to deal with employees who still struggle to get it, as the Pacers' Paul George demonstrated last week with a series of tweets that seemed to hold Palmer Rice at fault for the incident.\n\nThe league has no specific new initiatives regarding domestic violence that it is implementing in the wake of the Palmer incident. But it has programs already in place to try to educate incoming and returning players about domestic abuse.\n\nThose programs begin at the NBA Pre Draft Camp in Chicago, and continue through the mandatory Rookie Transition Program for all first-year players in late summer. Once the rookie begins playing with his team, there are additional initiatives during Team Awareness meetings during the season (players are required to attend at least two sessions) and from the league's Player Programs department. They are all designed to increase the player's understanding of what the league calls \"relationship management and safety;\" that is, getting it right with your spouse or significant other.\n\nEach of those sessions discusses the importance of knowing whom to include in a player's inner circle, and assessing the state of the player's relationships with his family, including his significant other. Players are told the exact legal definition of domestic violence and the ramifications of misconduct.\n\nThe outreach is not limited to players. The league sent out a memo last week reminding each team that all team employees, from the ownership group on down, are required to complete a sensitivity training course before the start of the season.\n\nTeams can, to varying degrees, also insist employees attend workshops detailing what constitutes anti-discrimination use of language, and how to respect the workplace. The league office shares best practices with teams and teams are supposed to have human resources meetings every month.\n\nThe RTP features speakers who detail the gruesome statistics about domestic violence. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, more than 42 million women in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner within their lifetime. One in three women have experienced physical violence by an intimate partner. (By the way: one in 10 men have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner.) The rest of the horrible numbers are here if you want them.\n\nAt RTP, speakers detail both incidents and preventative measures to stop domestic violence before it starts. In recent years, the rookies have heard from Glenda Hatchett, whose syndication courtroom show, Judge Hatchett, ran from 2000-08. This year, Kamilah Johnson, founder of the SASHA Center -- which helps educate and advise survivors of sexual assault in Detroit -- was the speaker.\n\nThe players, by all accounts, are engaged and take the discussions seriously. And yet, people fall through the cracks and fail to work out disagreements peacefully.\n\nLast summer, three players -- the Nuggets' Ty Lawson, the Celtics' Jared Sullinger and guard DeAndre Liggins, then with Oklahoma City -- were involved in incidents with women.\n\nLawson, along with his girlfriend, Ashley Pettiford, were arrested in August, 2013, after the couple had a verbal argument at his home. He was charged with physical harassment and criminal mischief; Pettiford was also charged in the incident, during which in two broke each other's cell phones. The charges against each were dismissed last October.\n\nSullinger was charged with assault and battery, destruction of property and intimidation of a witness after getting in an argument with his then live-in girlfriend, Deann Smith, in August of 2013. But the charges were dropped last October after Smith requested the charges be dismissed, and indicated she would not testify against Sullinger if called to the witness stand. Smith moved out of the couples' home, and the two sought counseling.\n\nLiggins was charged with three counts of domestic abuse, two counts of domestic assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, one count of kidnapping and one count of violating a protective order after hitting his girlfriend, Jasmine Horton, in August, 2013. Horton ultimately dropped all felony charges against Liggins stemming from the incident, though Liggins still has a misdemeanor domestic abuse charge pending. The couple has reconciled.\n\nThe Thunder released Liggins soon after the incident last September. He was taken by Miami's D-League affiliate in Sioux Falls in the D-League Draft last November, and was named the D-League Defensive Player of the Year, earning two 10-day contracts with the Heat. Liggins was signed by Detroit this summer and played well in the Samsung Vegas Summer League.\n\nIn 2007, Metta World Peace, then in Sacramento, was suspended by the league for seven games after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge of corporal injury to a spouse against his wife, Kimsha Artest. He was accused of grabbing, pushing and slapping her during an argument, and not allowing her to call 911. Other misdemeanor charges were dropped, and World Peace had to perform 100 hours of community service and attend violence treatment programs and parenting classes on the effects of domestic violence on children.\n\nAnd Jason Kidd, now the Bucks' head coach, admitted in 2001 that he'd struck his then-wife, Joumana, during an argument. When the couple divorced in 2007, each accused the other of domestic violence, with Joumana's lawsuit accusing Jason Kidd of striking her on several occasions.\n\nPenalties for conviction, pleading guilty or no contest to domestic violence charges were strengthened during the last collective bargaining negotiations.\n\nUnder Article VI of the current Agreement, any player who is convicted of or pleads guilty or no contest to a violent felony will be suspended for a minimum of 10 games. If the league and Players Association concur that a player has engaged in violent off-court conduct (the umbrella term under which domestic violence currently is defined), the player has to undergo a clinical evaluation by a neutral expert. That expert may then recommend counseling. (As we've seen in recent cases, though -- World Peace's role in the Brawl at Auburn Hills in 2004, and Gilbert Arenas bringing guns into the Wizards' locker room in 2010 -- the league has exercised its discretion to hand out significantly higher punishments for egregious activities.)\n\nAny player convicted of or who pleads guilty or no contest to a crime involving violent conduct must attend a minimum five counseling sessions with a therapist or counselor jointly selected by the NBA and the union. The counseling sessions are in addition to any penalties imposed by the league for the violent conduct.\n\nDespite all of the protocols, there should be no doubting that the NBA is likely to be in the same position as the NFL is right now in the near future -- unless men decide amongst themselves that this has to stop. CBS' James Brown had it pitch perfect in his pregame remarks last Thursday: this is about what men do from here on. This is what about what I do. The numbers bear it out: I am, and men are, failing women, and failing them terribly.\n\nI feel that your article's partial focus on whether Danny Ferry should be labeled with the term \"racist\" is missing the point. These weren't private comments made in confidence to a friend or family member that have been somehow been found, but statements in an actual staff meeting. This is how Ferry was actually doing his job, as it was in the context of a evaluating a player that the Hawks were considering signing.\n\nPublic perception shouldn't be the main issue here. I've managed teaching assistants in the past. If a TA made a statement suggesting that the race or sex of the students affected how they were being evaluated, I would feel immensely uncomfortable with trusting any of that TA's grades from that point forward.\n\nObviously, all of us are prejudiced in some way or another and that has to feed into what we do or think somehow, but openly presenting that in the context of work isn't something that should be tolerated. Of course this is happening in other places in the league, but those people should be nervous also!\n\nI understand this is your lived experience, and you have a much better sense for what the real environment surrounding an NBA franchise is like. But in the aftermath of the Sterling debacle, it's important to send the message that this sort of (milder) behavior also shouldn't be tolerated by the league. I want executives in the future to feel actively nervous because of this Ferry situation; there's plenty of room to be abrasive or insulting without explicitly speaking to racist stereotypes like Ferry did.\n\nWhile it's unrealistic to expect these attitudes or comments to vanish, allowing Ferry to stay in his position with some unspecified disciplinary action is sending a different message: it is okay to make these sort of statements as a part of your player evaluations as long as you're otherwise doing a good job. I believe that management should be held to a higher standard than players, because of the power relationship involved and the increased ability to contribute to an unsafe work environment.\n\nFair points, Ian. The main point of the column, though, was to address the central question so many had: Was/is Danny Ferry a racist? The work environment issue, certainly valid, was not part of that specific discussion. But the Hawks, like every other team, can address that quickly in the future, by having a more diverse front office. What was unsaid during this whole thing is Ferry's remarks were in a room full of white guys. I guarantee you he wouldn't have said that if there was a person of color on the call or in that office.\n\nThe Hawks, Part II. From Fabian Jennings:\n\nFunny, but despite your extensive analysis in the article in which you insist Ferry is not a racist, but Levenson is, I would tend to think something like the reverse. Ferry's comments seem closer to racism to me. Levenson's are more like the sheer ignorance of a capitalist businessman. It reflects a total, total absence of social understanding and conscience, but this particular expression of thick-headed stupidity -- of crude money-grubbing -- is not racism. It has quite another odious smell.\n\nThe best I can do for Ferry is remember my own days in the locker room -- a place where males, whether black or white, do not often distinguish themselves with respect to sensitivity. You can take the boy out of the locker room; but it's harder to take the locker room out of the boy.\n\nMany share your sentiment that Levenson was just talking business when he lamented the lack of prosperous whites attending Hawks games, Fabian. If he had just left it at that, I might have agreed. But when an owner of a team says he wants that team to hire more white cheerleaders, and he doesn't want to see as many black faces on the KissCam, that's not marketing -- that's racism. To me.\n\nThe Hawks, Part III. From David Theiss:\n\nJust one question: Do you believe the fundamental premise behind this quote from your article --\n\n\"... Levenson's e-mail also asks some fair questions. Why, indeed, are so many white people uncomfortable being around lots of black people?\"\n\n-- to be accurate?\n\nYes. I wouldn't have said so otherwise. I don't know that this is debatable, David. We are close to as segregated as a society as we've always been. The vast majority of whites continue to show, through their migrating patterns in housing, choices of schools, patronage of churches and a dozen other examples, that they would rather not be around people of color. That doesn't necessarily make them prejudiced or bigoted. But I don't know that it's something that can be argued.\n\nSend your questions, comments, criticisms and your solemn, solemn promise to never, ever put this into your mouth to daldridgetnt@gmail.com.

Not that any of the big three had a great time of it, with the Orioles losing Chris Davis for 25 games for taking a banned substance, and the Hawks/Ferry horror show in Atlanta. But the NFL has, for decades, been able to squash any issues that come up with the public. This week was different. It's too early to say there's been a sea change, but that league has never had to play defense like this.\n\n2) RIP, Marvin Barnes.

That was probably the highlight of Barnes's career, though, as he struggled with life as a pro -- mainly in the ABA -- and with life, generally.\n\n3) Great read here by ESPN.com's Tom Haberstroh on how the extended All-Star break the NBA is giving its players has a hidden but real cost for them.\n\n\"Danny's mistake will remain tied to him for a long time.

The answer is still unclear. Apple has not released official download rates for \"Songs of Innocence\" and U2's manager, Guy Oseary, also said he didn't know how many people had actually downloaded the album.\n\nBut that really wasn't the point: The album will live on in users' iCloud, and the band envisions new listeners accessing it for the first time for years to come.\n\n\"We're quite happy that 7 per cent of the planet has this album, and they can enjoy it at their leisure,\" Oseary said.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famers' move was hotly debated within the industry as people tried to assess whether it was another stroke of genius from a band that has been a top-selling juggernaut for decades or a ploy by an aging group trying to make a splash in a landscape that has vastly changed since it released its last album in 2009. Even though that album went platinum, its sales were a bit of a disappointment for the band.\n\nBack then, frontman Bono told The Associated Press, \"We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we (tried to) create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging for people who have grown up on a diet of pop stars.\"\n\nThat diet has gotten even more extreme since then, with album sales continuing to plummet industrywide, singles dominating and streaming services including Spotify and even iTunes helping to diminish the impact of a cohesive art form album.\n\nSo what is U2 trying to achieve with its latest Apple alliance? Oseary said the band achieved one goal: keeping the integrity of \"Songs\" intact by releasing it as an album. As far as U2's larger business goals?\n\n\"I don't expect everyone to get everything now,\" Oseary said. \"Maybe in a few years things will start making sense or they won't. But that's not our job. Our job is to make sure the music is in as many hands as possible. This was an incredible opportunity to do that.\"\n\nU2 joined Jay Z, Beyonce and a growing number of artists who are working out exclusive corporate deals and employing guerrilla ad campaigns rather than moving the album through the typical marketing plan of singles release and slow build to launch date.\n\nLike Jay Z and his Samsung partnership to launch \"Magna Carta ...

Of course, as we've seen time and time again, this often doesn't work out very well for Apple's rivals. In recent history, Samsung is the only company that has managed to build an Apple-bashing campaign into real commercial success, and it literally took tens of billions of dollars worth of marketing and advertising campaigns to make it happen.\n\nUnfortunately for most of Apple's rivals, they don't have tens of billions of dollars to back up their anti-Apple ads.\n\nWith Paypal having recently used \"Nudegate\" -- the recent scandal in which hundreds of nude celebrity photos were leaked due to iCloud breaches -- as an opportunity to take a shot at Apple, \"veteran design and management surgeon\" and well-known Apple pundit Kontra took the opportunity to look back very briefly at a couple other campaigns that took similar swipes at Apple.\n\nIncluded in the post are RealNetworks' poke at the iPod in 2004 that focused on iTunes DRM (remember RealNetworks?) and Nokia's 2007 claim that \"phones should be open to anything\" (after failing to react to the iPhone, Nokia collapsed and now it doesn't even make phones anymore).\n\nWill Paypal suffer a similar fate?

No two people are alike and different users have different priorities. There are so many factors to consider, it's obviously impossible to determine the \"best\" phone for everyone.\n\nBut it's BGR's job to try.\n\nWhile we obviously can't say which phone will be the personal favorite of each and every person out there, we can consider users' most common needs and wants in an effort to determine which smartphone might be most suited to the widest range of people.\n\nSince we handle so many phones here at BGR, we're also able to tell you which handsets offer unique and innovative features that other devices do not. More than that, we're well equipped to say which smartphones' unique features might be more widely appreciated than others.\n\nIt might seem like each and every new flagship Android phone that comes out is automatically the \"best\" until the next flagship phone comes along, but we can assure you that's simply not the case. Impressive specs stuffed into a slim housing do not make a smartphone great -- the user experience is what makes a smartphone great.\n\nRight from the get-go, it's beyond obvious that Motorola sought to offer the best possible user experience when it created the second-generation Moto X.\n\nLike its predecessor, users can order the new Moto X through Motorola's Moto Maker website, where people can build a Moto X to suit their taste. Beyond a black or white face, various accent colors and 16 different colors for the plastic back, users may also choose from one of four real wood backs or four genuine leather backs.\n\nThe result is a beautiful handset that is a direct reflection of the user's taste.\n\nIn terms of the hardware itself, the Moto X looks and feels like a premium smartphone, regardless of which material the user chooses. The aluminum bezel surrounding the outer edges of the phone play a big role there, as does the fact that the design, fit and finish on the Moto X are fantastic.\n\nMotorola's second-generation Moto X is a fixed battery phone, so the back is not removable. Some might suggest that this is bad news for heavy users who like to carry a second battery, but I strongly disagree. For the same price as a second OEM battery -- and you'll want to be sure to buy an authentic OEM battery -- users can choose from a wide range of compact portable chargers that hold even more juice than a second battery.\n\nThe benefit of not including a removable battery in the new Moto X is that the phone feels fantastic. There is not a single rattle, creak, wobble or mismatched line to be found. The build is perfect.\n\nAlso of note, the bamboo wood back on my Moto X review unit from Motorola is fantastic. It looks great, if feels good and it gives the phone some unique flare that no rival device can offer. The leather-backed phones I tried during my meetings with Motorola felt great as well.\n\nPremium backs made of wood or leather cost an additional $50 on the Moto Maker website.\n\nInside, the new Moto X is every bit as impressive as it is on the outside.\n\nMotorola's first Moto X was a nice phone but much of its appeal came from its rock bottom price tag. The display was low resolution compared to other leading phones, the specs were lackluster and performance was a bit behind the times.\n\nThe new Moto X changes all that.\n\nMotorola's second-generation X is still surprisingly affordable, with a price tag that starts at $499 compared to $649 for comparable rival handsets. This time, however, the phone's performance can absolutely keep pace with other flagship phones.\n\nThe 5.2-inch full HD OLED display on the new Moto X is absolutely gorgeous. In fact, each and every person I have shown the phone to has immediately commented about how stunning the screen is.\n\nSamsung and LG are typically the first names that come to mind when people discuss smartphone screens, and Apple is also still among the leaders as well. Thanks to the Moto X, we can definitely add Motorola's name to the list.\n\nMoving inside the phone, a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor powers the new Moto X.\n\nThis is not a bleeding-edge chipset since the Snapdragon 805 is now making its way into flagship phones, but the money Motorola saved by using an 801 -- and the savings it is passing along to end users -- does not come at the expense of performance. I have yet to come across any hiccups or bogging while testing this phone.\n\nAt first glance, the Moto X's software appears to be stock Android 4.4.4 KitKat, and for users looking for a great phone that runs stock Android, the X is a terrific option. The Moto X's version of Android does include some special additional features though, and these new features play a huge role in making the new Moto X so great.\n\nMotorola has put a great deal of effort not into creating software that acts as a virtual personal assistant. No, that's been done before. Instead, Motorola has created a phone that acts as a virtual personal assistant.\n\nIt's an important distinction.\n\nSolutions like Siri pack so much functionality that it's impossible to remember everything they can do for you. As a result, people end up using Siri to perform a few regular tasks, but mostly just to perform simple web searches.\n\nWith the new Moto X, voice and gesture controls aren't just features, they're part of the experience.\n\nIt starts right when you wake up, when a simple command wakes the Moto X from its nighttime do not disturb mode and prompts the phone to remind you of the day's first meeting. From there, the sky is the limit.\n\nYes, the Moto X uses Google Now to do just about anything Siri can do, but it's much, much more than that.\n\nThe phone knows when you're driving, and it can automatically read new messages aloud. When you're in a meeting, it will automatically silence notifications. Afraid you missed something important? No problem; simply reaching toward the phone will activate \"Moto Display,\" a smart and simple lock screen notification system that gives you instant previews only when you want them.\n\nThat's all barely the tip of the iceberg. With the Moto X's combination of voice and gesture commands, the sky is the limit -- but it's not overwhelming. Core functions are explained well so that users can take full advantage of these special features instead of forgetting about them and letting them sit idle, as is often the case with many of Siri's best features.\n\nAlso of note, Motorola says that the sensors and software that enable all of this great functionality have been optimized so there is barely any drain on the battery, despite the fact that the phone is always listening for zero-touch voice commands and gestures.\n\nWhere battery life is concerned, Motorola says you should expect a day of use out of the Moto X. In my usage, the phone indeed lasted through the day, though there wasn't always much juice left by nightfall.\n\nHeavy users who stream a lot of video and constantly use other power-hungry features may have trouble making it through a full day. Thankfully, Motorola offers a \"turbo charger\" for the Moto X, which can add eight hours of juice to the phone's battery in just 15 minutes.\n\nA final note for owners of the original Moto X: The camera on the new version of Motorola's flagship phone is improved. Images I captured with the new Moto X's 13-megapixel camera were nice and vivid, though there is still plenty of noise upon full zoom. The phone's camera can't compare to market leaders from the likes of Nokia, Apple and Samsung, but it's pretty good.\n\nThe hardware is beautiful, with a curved back that fits perfectly in hands both small and large. It feels great to hold; the phone is 9.9mm thick directly in the center, but as thin as just 3.8mm in certain areas thanks to the convex design.\n\nThe size is also just right, striking a balance by fitting a large 5.2-inch screen onto the device but curving the back so that it feels much more manageable than other phones with similarly sized screens.\n\nMotorola's software is also fantastic. The Moto X's various enhancements on top of stock Android 4.4.4 are tremendous, and the company has promised a speedy upgrade to Android L once Google finally releases it this fall.\n\nThe second-generation Moto X won't be the best phone for everyone but all things considered, it hits all the right notes and is a clear leader among currently available Android smartphones.", "Soon after Apple launched its larger-screen iPhones last week, rivals in Asia sent out mocking messages on Twitter, taunting the US company for being slow to catch up with the industry trend.\n\n\"No one is going to buy a big phone,\" Samsung Electronics teased, quoting a 2010 remark by Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs. \"Guess who surprised themselves and changed their minds?\"\n\nFrom Taipei and Tokyo, smartphone rivals HTC and Sony sent out similarly irreverent tweets.\n\nThe light-hearted tone of the messages concealed a serious headache for Apple's Asian competitors. While they have often moved into new product areas such as large-screen phones, smartwatches and payment technology before the US tech group, they have consistently been unable to match the excitement generated by Apple product launches - or its success in monetising and globalising their usage.\n\nApple's two new iPhones have larger screens than their predecessors, taking the company into \"phablet\" territory pioneered by Samsung, which launched the fourth version of its Galaxy Note at the beginning of September.\n\n\"When the Note was announced, I couldn't understand it,\" said Ben Wood at the research group CCS Insight, referring to the 2011 launch of Samsung's first phablet. \"It looked ridiculous. And now it's become a legitimate category.\"\n\nSamsung declined to reveal how many Notes it has sold since the new launch, but said it shipped 10m units of the previous model in the first two months after its launch last year.\n\nStill, analysts believe that Apple's lead in the brand stakes - in spite of Samsung's huge outlays on marketing, on which it spent $14bn last year - will eat into the Korean group's first-mover advantage. \"Consumers have an incredible emotional engagement with the Apple brand,\" said Mr Wood. \"Samsung hasn't achieved that.\"\n\nIf Samsung's advertising campaigns have at least helped it narrow the popularity gap with Apple, Taiwan's HTC shows the challenges facing smaller Asian smartphone producers seeking to compete at the high end of the market.\n\nWhile its One series of phones have been praised by some reviewers as the most attractively designed smartphone to date, the lack of marketing clout to support it has left the company floundering commercially. HTC has predicted a 12th consecutive quarter of declining revenues in the third quarter of this year.\n\nA similar tale is told in the smartwatch sector.\n\nSamsung is the global leader by volume sales, having released five different smartwatch models since the first Galaxy Gear was unveiled a year ago.\n\nThe company \"is ahead on technology\", said Mark Newman, analyst at Bernstein, arguing that the group has \"positioned itself well for the next decade of growth\" in wearable electronics.\n\nIts South Korean rival LG Electronics launched its G Watch in July with an improved version to follow by the end of this year.\n\nYet neither of these launches came close to matching the hype around the Apple Watch.\n\n\"Apple understands the watch business better than Samsung,\" said Daniel Kim, an analyst at Macquarie, noting Apple's poaching of executives from the fashion industry such as Angela Ahrendts, former chief executive of Burberry.\"Samsung's smartwatches look ugly and there is a lack of useful apps.\"\n\nCorporate Japan abounds with innovations that failed to become global hits. The Japanese call this \"Gal\u00e1pagos syndrome\", whereby companies forge ahead into new technological territory but fail to find a market outside of the country - only for foreign rivals to take the idea global.\n\nIn 1999, Kyocera introduced the world's first mobile phone with a built-in camera and sparked the cameraphone boom in Japan, years before this function became commonplace outside Japan.\n\nIn 2004, Sony came out with an ebook reader three years before Amazon's Kindle but lost out in global sales due to higher pricing and a fewer number of offerings. The company also launched the LiveView smartwatch in 2010, beating both Samsung and Apple to the market.\n\nAnalysts said Japanese companies are often content with being the first to market the latest technology but are less successful at showing consumers how those technologies will make their lives easier. \"The obsession with technology overlooks what is really needed to convince the consumer to buy: the ease to use. And that's what Apple has capitalised on,\" said Atul Goyal, analyst at Jefferies.\n\nMobile payments are the latest example.\n\nTen years ago, NTT DoCoMo introduced phones dubbed osaifu-keitai, or mobile wallets, running on Sony's patented Felica technology, an early form of the near-field communication technology that will be used by Apple Pay. Nearly half of Japan's mobile phone owners now use the FeliCa system, which has become embedded in daily routines from using public transport to unlocking doors.\n\nYet NTT DoCoMo and Sony, through their joint venture FeliCa Networks, have struggled to export the concept of using mobile phones as electronic wallets. Only in Hong Kong, where Sony's FeliCa chips were used to create Octopus smart cards in 1997 and for mobile payments from last year, has it had any success.\n\n\"We went in too early and the environment wasn't ripe,\" an executive at FeliCa Networks said earlier this year.\n\nCritics say Japanese companies focus too much on perfecting their technologies in their home market, leading to a system or standard that is unique to Japan. In the US and Europe, Sony was unable to convince carriers, transportation operators and other partners to adopt the FeliCa system since the overseas markets use differing types of contactless pay technology.\n\nYasutoshi Kikuchi, partner at Roland Berger, the consultants, added that Sony needs to shift away from gadget-making and focus on where it can generate revenue. Apple's success, for example, stems from its ability to tap into existing users by offering not only new devices but added services such as the iTunes store.\n\nIn the same way, Sony is now trying to build the PlayStation gaming console into a subscription-based platform, bringing together users of various gadgets from mobile phones, televisions, tablets to portable game players with a wide ranging of offerings from games and movies to live TV programs.", "Note: This article was first published May 8, 2014. It has been updated to reflect the timing of new refrigerator efficiency standards established by the U.S. Department of Energy, which go into effect this week.\n\nYou've probably heard of Energy Star -- the program launched by the U.S. government to incentivize efficiency in product development. Created by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1992, the voluntary program awards attention-grabbing blue \"badges\" to products that meet certain efficiency standards.\n\nThe Energy Star badge goes one step beyond the federal minimum efficiency standards established by the Department of Energy in 1975. And while it's considered voluntary, the marketing advantage Energy Star provides ensures that the vast majority of products meet the program's requirements.\n\nThe marketing advantage Energy Star provides ensures that the vast majority of products meet the program's requirements.\n\nAlong with the federal minimum standards, Energy Star has helped improve efficiency performance across more than 60 product categories. In 1993, the year after the program launched, American homes consumed an average of 103.6 million BTUs of energy, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. By 2009, that figure had dropped to 89.6 million BTUs -- a 14 percent decrease in energy consumption per household.\n\nOf course, there are more housing units today than there were in 1993 -- about 17 million more. So that surge in housing forced a 2 percent net increase in residential energy consumption. However, if household energy consumption remained at its 1993 levels, there would have been an 18 percent increase in total residential energy usage.\n\nClearly, these numbers support the existence of both federal efficiency standards and the Energy Star program. The marketing advantage for manufacturers is also clear. Among fridges, roughly 80 percent are now Energy Star qualified.\n\nAmong fridges, roughly 80 percent are now Energy Star qualified.\n\nHowever, there has always been some back-and-forth between the industry, the government, and private efficiency advocates over the proper specifications for these programs.\n\nStarting this week, residential refrigerators will have to meet a new set of efficiency requirements for both Energy Star and the Department of Energy's federal minimums -- the latter of which is obligatory. This has sent manufacturers scrambling to bring more efficient fridges to market, causing confusion among producers and consumers alike.\n\nWhy refrigerators?\n\nFridges are a unique category: They run 24 hours a day, and are generally considered an indispensable part of the modern home. They're also one of the most energy-intensive products in the home. And over the past few decades, their efficiency has skyrocketed.\n\nSo why is the EPA upgrading fridge standards now? Why not focus on more wasteful products like ovens and dryers? Aren't fridges efficient enough? Are these new rules... excessive?\n\nIt's certainly true that modern refrigerators are staggeringly more efficient than models produced in the 1970's and 80's -- in some cases by up to 75 percent. The Energy Star requirements that go into effect this week stipulate that a 28-cubic-foot fridge may not exceed 403.82 kWh per year. If you compare that with the average annual energy consumption of a fridge in 1980 -- roughly 1,250 kWh/year -- you can see how great the improvement has been.\n\nEven a new Energy Star-labeled fridge consumes more energy per year than the average citizen of Ghana.\n\nBut these statistics are a bit misleading, if only because of how darn wasteful older machines were. Even with the new Energy Star requirements, the refrigerator itself is one of the most energy-intensive products in the home, perhaps second only to the air conditioner.\n\nFridges make up roughly 5 percent of an average U.S. home's total energy consumption, according to EIA data, and even a new Energy Star-labeled fridge -- which improves 10 percent on previous generations -- consumes more energy per year than the average citizen of Ghana.\n\n\"Ten percent may not seem like a big number,\" says Ann Bailey, product labeling branch chief for Energy Star. \"But when you look at what that means across all of the sales, when all refrigerators have met those requirements, the difference amounts to the equivalent of taking one million cars off the road -- and $890 million in energy savings.\"\n\n\"The difference amounts to the equivalent of taking one million cars off the road -- and $890 million in energy savings.\"\n\nEarl F. Jones, senior counsel for GE Appliance and Lighting, agrees. While acknowledging that Energy Star is hardly a \"voluntary\" program due to the economic realities of the market, Jones points out that the average increase in efficiency from the 2001 standards to 2014 is 30 percent. And that's just the DOE-regulated minimum requirements.\n\n\"Thirty percent savings in a refrigerator is very significant,\" he says. \"Plus, remember this is a product that's on 24/7. The potential for savings is more significant than [...] products where you're also getting new standards next year, but your use of them is intermittent.\"\n\nWhy now?\n\nSo despite being considerably more efficient than in the past, fridges are among the most important of household appliances. But the question remains: Why now? Why implement new DOE standards and Energy Star requirements at the same time? According to Bailey, the changes have more to do with seizing an opportunity than foisting regulations on an unprepared industry.\n\n\"We've heard very strong encouragement from the industry to align the timing, because the federal test procedure was also changing,\" Bailey says. \"So there was an opportunity to minimize confusion about which test procedure was being used for which program.\"\n\nBut what about consumers? Surely the frantic need to upgrade fridge technology is going to result in higher retail prices. One also has to ask how much fridge performance is being sacrificed in favor of efficiency.\n\nGE's Jones acknowledges this question and raises a few others.\n\n\"The government is supposed to take into consideration a few issues,\" he says. \"One: Can consumers get their money back [as a result of] the increased cost of product? Two: Can the manufacturers afford the investment that's going to be required to make these changes? And three: Is the solution that we're coming up with technologically feasible?\"\n\nAccording to Bailey, the government is not simply looking at what's possible and establishing that as the goal. Nor is it neglectful of performance considerations when establishing standards.\n\n\"The way we operate is we look at what's currently available on the market, or shortly going to be available, and then we set our levels so that the ones that earn the Energy Star [...] will get a competitive advantage,\" she points out.\n\n\"It is expressly an intention of our program not to set the levels so aggressively that it would result in performance problems,\" she adds. \"And this is part of the back-and-forth when we're considering different levels that we engage the industry on.\"\n\nPart of that back-and-forth means providing manufacturers with ample time to upgrade their products. The new Energy Star requirements, for example, were announced in April of last year, yet don't go into effect until this month. Accordingly, fridge makers like Samsung and GE have already brought 2014 Energy Star-eligible fridges to market. Two of those models (the GE Profile PFE29PSDSS and GE Cafe CFE29TSDSS) won Reviewed.com Best of Year Awards for 2013.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nJones insists that efficiency is never prioritized over performance, if only for the fact that consumers would reject such a product. Efficiency just isn't as important to consumers as whether or not the darn thing works.\n\nEfficiency just isn't as important to consumers as whether or not the darn thing works.\n\n\"Even if you were going to be challenged that way,\" Jones says, \"you'd go the extra mile in your technology development to figure out a way to overcome that problem.\"\n\nAnd this ties into the original intent of programs like Energy Star. While efficiency standards provide a great deal of energy savings on the large scale, the amount of money saved by consumers is relatively insignificant. A 10 percent increase in refrigerator efficiency equates to roughly $6 saved on the average utility bill per year. So why should anyone care about these new requirements?\n\nThe answer, according to GE's Jones, is in the long term. Even a fridge that was built to meet the 2006 minimum standards, he says, would consume at least 20 percent more energy than one bought in 2014. \"And the lifetime savings would be much more significant,\" he adds.\n\nThat said, it's a tough sell to claim that these savings are alone worth the investment in a new fridge, and more importantly, this pitch sidesteps the real reason Energy Star and federal minimum standards were established in the first place: to save energy on a national scale.\n\nIt's one of those situations where the interests of the average consumer don't necessarily align with the interests of the public as a whole -- something both the industry and the government understand, even if they don't use those terms to describe it.", "As if there weren't enough Galaxy variations, Samsung appears to be readying a made-for-selfies version of its Galaxy Grand phone.\n\nNoted by Android Authority, pictures and specs of the Galaxy Grand Prime appeared on Vietnamese site TheGioididong. The 5-inch smartphone will supposedly boast a 5-megapixel front camera, making it the sharpest selfie shooter from Samsung yet. The Galaxy S5 carries a 2.1-megapixel front camera, while the Galaxy Note 4 has a 3.7-MP sensor. The latter has a wider-angle lens to capture more of the scene.\n\nDespite the grandiose name, the Galaxy Grand Prime appears to have midrange specs other than its front camera. If the report is accurate, the device will be powered by a 1.2-GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM and house a 2,600-mAh battery.TheGioididong report states the Grand Prime's screen will have a relatively low resolution of 960 x 540 pixels.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 packs a powerful 2.5-GHz Snapdragon 801 CPU, 2GB of RAM and a 2,800-mAh power pack. The Galaxy Note 4 has an even faster Snapdragon 805 chip and a large 3200-mAh battery. The S5 has a 1920 x 1080-pixel screen, while the Galaxy Note 4 steps that up to 2560 x 1400 pixels.\n\nThe rumored Galaxy Grand Prime isn't the only smartphone with a 5-MP front camera. The Huawei Ascend Mate7 does as well, and promises 2 days of battery life, so we'll have to see which handset is the true king of selfies.", "If any larger tech corporation could be considered adventurous, it has to be Sammy. Now interested in tapping into the very niche market of selfie-centric consumers, Samsung is reportedly working on a new Galaxy Grand Prime smartphone. The latest leaks suggest that the new edition in the series will have a primary focus to please those who want to have a strong front shooter.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Grand Prime will be the conventional Galaxy phone with a 5-inch QHD 960 x 540p screen and carries almost all the specs of the Galaxy Grand 2 except of course a downgraded display. The leak around Galaxy Grand Prime comes through a Vietnamese website.\n\nThe highlight, however, is the 5-megapixel front shooter making it a perfect smartphone for the selfie fans. The rear camera is a moderate 8-megapixel deal and the smartphone will be powered by a Snapdragon 400 processor, 1GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage. Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime will come with Android 4.4 KitKat.\n\nIf rumors are to be believed, we will see Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime launching in October in Vietnam.", "We'll say this about Microsoft's OneNote team: It's clear they want to be on every device, even ones you might not be buying. Earlier this year, the company came out with an Amazon application in the wake of some truly awful Fire phone reviews. Now, Microsoft is releasing OneNote for Android Wear, Google's still-nascent smartwatch platform. Starting today, if you happen to own a Moto 360, Samsung Gear Live or LG G Watch, you can capture a note by saying \"OK Google, take a note.\"\n\nMeanwhile, OneNote's other apps have also received updates. With iOS 8 coming out today, iPhone and iPad users can now save clips to the web, as well as save pictures and send file attachments -- all without having to leave your current app. (\"Extensibility,\" as it's called, is one of the big new features in iOS 8. You'll probably see lots of apps get similar updates.) Finally, OneNote for Windows Phone will now let you save scanned photos as a Word or PowerPoint file. That's all you need to know for now, but we've included Microsoft's official blog posts below, where you'll find download links and maybe a demo video or two.", "Blinkbox is one of the best on-demand video services out there. It has a great catalogue of content with an easy-to-use interface. And you can access Blinkbox from an impressive range of devices on a variety of platforms. Our only concerns are the less than stellar broadcast quality, and the fact that Blinkbox doesn't play nicely with mobile devices.\n\nBut if you want to access a wide range of recent video releases from multiple devices, Blinkbox is where its at. (Just don't be afraid to check out the competition - Netflix vs Amazon Prime Instant Video comparison review: What's the best streaming service?)\n\nBlinkbox is a video-streaming service. More prosaically it is the on-demand video service from Tesco. You don't have to subscribe, you simply have to sign up and then you can purchase or rent content as you go.\n\nSign up and you can use Blinkbox to stream content on an impressive number of platforms and devides. Watch video on your PC, laptops, tablet or games console. You can watch Blinkbox video on iPads, Windows tablets and Android tabs, as well as Windows PCs and Macs. A variety of Blu-ray players and TVs from the likes of Samsung, LG, Philips and Toshiba also support Blinkbox.\n\nWe particularly liked the useful Windows 8 app for Blinkbox, and many of the words in that sentence have never previously been written together.\n\nThat's all good, but there are some limitations. Blinkbox is primarily a streaming service: to download content you need to be using a PC or Mac. Perhaps because of this requirement to be connected there is no real mobile option. Unless you are streaming to tablet via a particularly robust connection. Otherwise we found Blinkbox worked well on a variety of platforms. (There are ways around these problems, too. See: How to connect a laptop to TV with HDMI and more.)\n\nEach purchase can be watched on only one device at a time, which seems fair. It can be a bit faffy to jump from device to device but we imagine in most user scenarios you will be watching a whole film or show on just the one device. One account can be used to register up to five devices. If you want to switch to a sixth device you can - up to three times every 90 days.\n\nThat's the basics. But as with all on-demand content services, it is the content itself that is critical. And here, as you might expect from Tesco, there is a lot to browse. We were particularly impressed with the number of latest release movies - generally available at the same time as the Blu-ray and DVD release. You won't see movies that quickly very often on rival subscription services.\n\nThe TV offering is not quite as good. There is a fair smattering of older domestic free-to-air TV content, and some premium pay-TV content including Game of Thrones. But if you come for the TV, you'll stay for the movies.\n\nNew movies generally cost around \u00a33.49 to rent, \u00a34.49 to rent in HD. You can buy movies for \u00a39.99 or \u00a312.99 in HD. And a whole series of Game of Thrones will set you back \u00a317.99. Once rented you have 48 hours to watch a movie after you start watching. And that must occur within 30 days of the transaction.\n\nA movie-streaming interface is, well, a movie-streaming interface. But Blinkbox's is as good-looking as you are likely to get, and we found it relatively easy to use. Easy enough. The tablet apps are less pretty but functional. We have more here: Blinkbox for iPad and Android review.\n\nPlayback quality is less impressive, however. Watch on your PC or an Xbox console and you can enjoy up to 720p content (if you pay for HD). Everywhere else you are in standard def, and that is disappointing. Sound is stereo and good enough, but the whole package is based on ease of access rather than quality of experience. If you are a Blu-ray toting, AV-expert cinephile this is not the service for you. (See also: Do I need a TV Licence?

Global ETF experts who converged here last week for Bursa Malaysia's ETFs and Securities Borrowing and Lending (SBL) Conference, were in unison in pinpointing limited investor awareness as the culprit for the fund's lack of success.\n\nThe Malaysian ETF market stands at RM1.03 billion of assets under management (AUM) as at August 2014, versus the global figure of more than US$3 trillion (RM9.6 trillion) by year-end.\n\n\"Malaysia is definitely on track to greater usage of ETFs, judging by the growth of mutual funds, rising income levels and all the pension schemes that are being initiated,\" said South Korea's Samsung Asset Management (SAM) head of business development of ETF and Index Investment Division Peter Lee in an interview with Business Times.\n\nSAM currently manages US$120 billion of AUM and according to Lee, half comes from the company's ETF products. The asset management company is also expecting to grow that number to US$280 billion by year-end.\n\n\"We are following the Malaysian market with great interest as we see massive potential, especially within the ETF segment that's waiting to be exploited. However, before we land here, the existing market needs to do its best to expand domestically.\n\n\"Even in countries that ETFs have not been doing well, the domestic equity ETFs have been performing better than the rest, with up to 80 per cent of the domestic equity representing the country's total ETF market. When Malaysia has a strong domestic market, then only can it expand internationally,\" said Lee.\n\nInvesco Hong Kong Ltd's director and head of ETF Business of Greater China Christine Huang told Business Times that what the Malaysian market lacks is \"uniqueness\".\n\ntransparen\" The ETF segments of China and the United States are similar in that both are large countries that trade in a single currency, which allows expanding the girth of our ETF markets.\n\nMalaysia is much smaller in comparison, therefore it needs to tap regional and global markets,\" she said.\n\n\"As of now, Malaysia lacks the tool to go cross borders. In order to attract international investors, Malaysia needs to come up with a tool, a new ETF that looks beyond the Asean region and into the international market. Getting the tool would be the first step; the other is to create a market uniqueness that will attract investors to come here.\"\n\nThat \"uniqueness\" that Huang speaks of might just come in the form of Islamic ETFs; which i-VCAP Management Sdn Bhd, the syariah-compliant arm of ValueCAP Sdn Bhd, has launched.\n\nAs of last month, i-VCAP was managing RM320 million ETFs out of its total RM1 billion AUM.\n\n\"We launched our first Islamic ETF, which incidentally was Malaysia and Southeast Asia's first Islamic ETF, in 2008 and our second one was in March this year. Since then, we have received growing interest year-on-year for both products ... the interest is there, but market participation has not gained as much traction,\" i-VCAP chief executive officer Mahzdir Othman said.\n\n\"The challenge when it comes to the Malaysian ETF market is definitely awareness but once we pass that, especially with government and Bursa backings, the growth potential for Islamic ETFs will be massive.\"\n\nMahzdir also said that Malaysia is well-positioned to capitalise on its success as the world's premier Islamic finance hub.\n\n\"We are the world's leader when it comes to sukuk ... I don't see why we can't be the same in Islamic ETFs. In fact, we believe in the potential of Islamic ETFs so much that we are launching another product by year-end,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bursa Malaysia data, there are currently five ETF products traded on the bourse -- the CIMB FTSE China 25 ETF, CIMB/FTSE Asean 40 Malaysia ETF, myETF Dow Jones Islamic Market Malaysia Titans 25, FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI ETF and the ABF Malaysia Bond Index Fund.\n\nAn ETF is a unit trust that is listed and traded on a stock exchange. An open-ended fund with no expiry date, it usually tracks or replicates the performance of a benchmark index. Investors can buy or sell ETF units on the stock exchange through remisiers, the same way they buy or sell stocks.\n\nOn the global stage, ETFs have been growing at a phenomenal rate, estimated at some 20 per cent of compounded annual growth rate since its debut on the Toronto Index Participation Fund (TIP 35) in 1989.", "Barclaycard's bPay band can now be used to tap in on the Underground\n\nWhile much has been made of how credit and debit cards can now be used in place of tickets and oyster cards to travel across London on the Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground and National Rail services, your wrist and phone can also help you navigate the capital.\n\nEE's Cash on Tap\n\nEE's contactless payment service, enabling customers to pay for anything under the value of \u00a320 by tapping their phone on a contactless phone reader, has now been extended for TfL use.\n\n4GEE pay monthly customers who own compatible phones from HTC, Samsung and Sony (a full list can be found here) can download the Cash on Tap app from the Google Play store.

It's a practice in patience to earn the bragging rights of being among the first to purchase the newest of iDevices, paying off for many when Apple launched the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Those that weren't able to get their hands on either of these new handsets will have to wait until October, as they've already sold out.\n\nSo what makes the new iPhone 6 Plus so special, and can it compete with the range of phablets already available in the market?

Juniper Research reports that handset shipments are forecast to jump from 985 million in 2013 to 1.2 billion this year.\n\nSmartphone popularity continues to rise, and this has been driven -- at least in part -- by the appearance of handsets with bargain basement prices. While the likes of Apple push premium-priced smartphones, emerging markets are lapping up handsets priced at $150 and under.\n\nIn fact, Juniper Research singled out two categories of smartphones that are responsible for rocketing sales. \"Low-cost Economy\" handsets are identified as those costing $75-150, while \"Ultra Economy\" devices are those priced under $75. Handsets at these prices are available around the world, but it is in emerging markets where the cheaper price points are proving particularly appealing. Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi is singled out for particular attention for its aggressive pricing in India and China, putting up competition for market-leaders Apple and Samsung.\n\nThese two manufacturers still account for 45 percent of global handset shipments, despite the higher prices. The established popularity of higher-priced handsets looks set to be diluted by success in emerging markets. Analysts suggest that by 2019 the average price of smartphones will drop to $274. Considering the fact that some handsets are currently nudging towards $1,000, it's clear that cheaper smartphones are going to become increasingly significant.\n\nThe shape of the smartphone market is changing rapidly. The report also suggests that sales are starting to stagnate in more established markets as smartphone uptake reaches saturation point. By the end of 2014 it is expected that Far East & China, Indian Subcontinent, Latin America, and Africa and Middle East are likely to account for more than half of smartphone shipments. It's unlikely that Apple and Samsung will produce handsets to compete in the cheaper end of the market, and it's probable that the two-tier pricing will continue around the world. Whether the cheaper manufacturers can expand into more established markets and steal some of the big players' thunder remains to be seen.", "Samsung has launched a new high-end snapper, a fast compact system camera to rival DSLRs for professional usage.\n\nThe Samsung NX1 boasts a 28 megapixel APS-C BSI CMOS sensor, supports 4K video recording, and has a new NX Auto Focus System III with 205 Phase Detection AF. The latter delivers an autofocus speed of 0.055 seconds to help ensure you capture the moment with clarity -- and this camera offers 15 fps (frames per second) continuous shooting to cover entire action sequences.\n\nThe CMOS sensor features a Back Side Illumination (BSI) structure with a micro lens array, which Samsung claims reduces image noise even in low light conditions. The camera supports native ISO 100-25600 and extended ISO to 51200, meaning photographers can capture quality images when conditions are pretty dark indeed.\n\nA new Samsung Auto Shot feature uses the camera's DRIMe V processor for recognizing high-speed motion shots, and can time the taking of a photo intelligently by predicting the best moment to grab the snap (such as, for example, when a cricket player strikes the ball with his or her bat).\n\nIn terms of build quality, the NX1 is fashioned from magnesium alloy and is ergonomically designed to be comfortable to hold. It also offers dust and splash resistance, with rubber seals to protect the buttons.\n\nThe camera has a 3in Super AMOLED touch display, and also an Electronic Viewfinder which is an XGA OLED display with a lag time of only 0.005 seconds thanks to the DRIMe V processor, meaning what you see through it is to all intents and purposes in real-time.\n\nThe camera also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in terms of connectivity with other devices.\n\nFinally, a new NX lens has been introduced, a 50-150mm 2.8 S ED OIS lens, with an F2.8 maximum aperture and 35mm equivalent 77-231mm focal range. Samsung says it's a \"premium telephoto lens perfectly matched with the NX1\".\n\nPaul Scott, Head of Marketing, Samsung Digital Imaging UK and Ireland, commented: \"With the NX1, we are giving our customers the chance to experience the most advanced photographic innovations within a fast compact system camera (CSC).

The smartphone features a MediaTek quad-core processor and a 4.5-inch screen.\n\nThe Spice Android One Dream UNO Mi-498 is priced at Rs 6299 on Flipkart, the Karbonn Android One Sparkle V is available for Rs 6399 on Snapdeal and the Micromax Canvas A1 is listed on Amazon.in at Rs 6,499.\n\nWith Android One, Google aims to improve the quality of hardware and software by giving handset makers a frame of reference. Currently, many affordable smartphones in India already offer customised versions of the Android operating system. In case of Android One, the eventual software upgrades on the Android One phones would come directly from Google. This would give Google better control of the operating system and ensure users get a consistent service.\n\nGartner Principal Research Analyst Vishal Tripathi said Android One devices will be under Google's control thereby ensuring a standard hardware and software specs, which in turn will lead to a better experience for the consumers.\n\n\"Besides, it will also help to consolidate the highly fragmented smartphone market in India. No doubt competition will intensify due to this launch,\" he added.\n\nChip maker MediaTek said it expects as many as two million handsets to be sold this year in India.\n\nGreyhound Research CEO Sanchit Vir Gogia feels Android One is going to be a game changer in India.\n\nGoogle's goal is to reach the next 5 billion people in emerging markets and a billion in India. This gives them an edge as compared Microsoft, Apple and Blackberry, he added.\n\n\"Android One gives Google tighter control over the Google OS which means standardised UX. Support for seven regional languages is going to be a solid plus over competitors - this will not only help consumers use vernacular, it is also likely to help promote apps in regional language,\" Gogia said.\n\nThe launch is also important for the e-commerce partners as electronics - especially mobile phones - are one of the highest selling items on e-commerce sites.\n\nMotorola and Xiaomi have successfully launched their smartphones on Flipkart, while players like Spice and Micromax have sold devices on Snapdeal.\n\ne-Commerce sites see about 4 million queries per day in India for smartphones and in two years, one in four phones are expected to be bought online.\n\nGoogle also said that Newstand, which provides digital version of newspapers and magazines, will come to India from tomorrow.\n\nAccording to research firm IDC, smartphone sales in the country grew almost three-fold to over 44 million in 2013, buoyed by affordable devices made by local firms such as Micromax and Karbonn.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2014, 18.42 million smartphones were shipped in India. Though Samsung is the leader with a 29 per cent market share, Micromax (18 per cent), Karbonn (8 per cent) and LAVA (6 per cent) are close competitors.\n\nWhile Android is the dominant operating system globally, other OS' like Windows and iOS (Apple) are also gaining traction. Also, newer platforms like Firefox and Tizen may emerge as strong challengers to Google's platform.\n\nGoogle's attempts are also important as it aims to capture a larger share of the entry-level segment.\n\nLast week, Firefox (in partnership with Spice and Intex) launched two new smartphones, priced below Rs 2,300, aimed at those looking to upgrade from feature phones to smartphones.\n\nOn the competition to Android One, Gogia said Greyhound Research believes that Google can expect competition but none has the wherewithal like Google to be as aggressive and invest heavily in the ecosystem.\n\n\"Both, Microsoft and Apple are not eyeing this market at all, so we can safely expect Google to pretty much own this market. Eventually, Android One will touch Tablets as well,\" he said.\n\nIndia is the first country where Google's Android One devices are being launched. Roll out across other markets like Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka will follow in the coming months. Google is also expanding Android One programme with Acer, Alcatal OneTouch, Xolo, HTC, Lava, Intex, Asus and Lenovo. It has also roped in Qualcomm for the chipsets.", "WHEN LENOVO ANNOUNCED IT WOULD BUY MOTOROLA from Google, it said its goal was to increase its global smartphone presence and enter the Western European market.\n\nThe Vibe X2 is the latest step in Lenovo's expansion plans and debuts some cutting-edge technologies designed to showcase what the Chinese firm has to offer.\n\nDesign and build\n\nLenovo prides itself on the Vibe X2's design, claiming it is the first \"layered smartphone\" in the world, and we can see why the firm is so keen to boast about it. The Vibe X2 is built from three distinct sections, each of which has a different colour and texture. These range from basic polycarbonate backplate to a more esoteric \"wood\" finish.\n\nAnother interesting design twist, which we sadly didn't get to test during our hands-on, is the addition of \"Xtensions\". These are extra custom covers that add new functions to the Vibe X2, such as improved sound quality.\n\nDespite being built in three layers, the Vibe X2 is reasonably thin, measuring 7.3mm thick. The 5in device is also comfortable to hold and feels fairly similar to Sony's range of straight-edged Xperia devices.\n\nWe were also reasonably impressed with the Vibe X2's build quality. It felt solid and left us fairly sure that it would survive the odd accidental bump and scrape. The rear backplate's slightly matt finish also felt suitably scratch and blemish resistant.\n\nDisplay\n\nDisplay technology is an increasingly important factor for many potential buyers, so Lenovo has configured the Vibe X2 with a 5in, 1080x1920 resolution 441ppi IPS LCD touchscreen. Using the screen on the brightly lit showroom floor we were impressed by how well it performed. Colours on the display were rich and vibrant and the screen showed surprisingly wide viewing angles.\n\nOperating system\n\nUnlike Motorola, Lenovo chose to tweak the Vibe X2's Android 4.4 Kitkat operating system with its custom Vibe UI 2.0 skin.\n\nThe changes we noticed during our hands on were fairly unobtrusive and amounted to little more than tweaked application icons and menu layouts, but under the hood the Vibe X2 does have a few notable features, one of the most useful of which is its quick-access lock screen.\n\nThe feature is designed to let you more quickly access regularly accessed applications from the lock screen using screen taps. It lets you activate the lock screen from sleep with one tap and access a quick menu with shortcuts to recently opened apps with a second tap. While small, we can see the feature being a selling point for business buyers who regularly have to access emails or check incoming messages on the move.\n\nPerformance\n\nOne of the Vibe X2's most interesting features is its Mediatek eight-core processor, using a mix of ARM Cortex-A17 and low-power Cortex-A7 cores. In a clear shot at Samsung, which has recently launched smartphones and tablets with its own Exynos 'octa-core' chips, Lenovo claims the Mediatek processor is the first \"true\" processor of this kind and, paired with 2GB of RAM, will allow the Vibe X2 to easily outperform competing handsets.\n\nWe found there could be some truth to this claim. During our hands-on, the Vibe X2 moved between windows and open applications smoothly and stutter-free, and proved capable of opening multiple content-rich websites in the native browser app hassle free.\n\nWe're keen to see how the Vibe X2 performs when faced with more demanding tasks, such as 3D gaming, upon its release later this year.\n\nCamera\n\nThe Vibe X2 comes with a 13MP rear camera with a back-illuminated sensor and 5MP front camera, which we were also impressed with.\n\nShots taken on the Vibe X2 looked reasonably vibrant, crisp and had decent colour balance. The only possible issue we noticed was that, on a few occasions, the shutter speed was slightly slower than we'd have liked, which is odd as Lenovo claims the handset has advanced \"instant-capture\" capabilities.\n\nIn terms of shot modes, the unit we had featured all the staple options you'd expect, such as burst, panorama and HDR, plus a more esoteric 'beauty mode'. The beauty mode works the same way as the equivalent feature seen on Huawei's Ascend P7 and is meant to let users quickly remove blemishes from selfies. But we really can't see this taking off with business users.\n\nBattery and storage\n\nThe Lenovo Vibe X2 comes loaded with 32GB of internal storage, which sadly can't be upgraded due to the device's lack of a microSD card slot. However, considering the number of cloud storage services available, we can't see this being too much of an issue for many buyers.\n\nBeyond this, the Vibe X2 is powered by a 2,300mAh non-removable battery, which Lenovo claims will easily last a full day's use on one charge. But we didn't get a chance to check this claim during our hands-on.\n\nPrice and release date\n\nThe Vibe X2 will launch in China in September, costing $399 SIM-free. It is unclear if the Vibe Z2 or X2 will be released in the UK, though Lenovo has promised to make the phones \"available in select regions starting in October\".\n\nOverall\n\nWhile it's still unclear if the Vibe X2 will launch in the UK the device is still interesting. Featuring a unique and original design and \"true\" eight-core mobile processor, the Vibe X2 is clear proof that Lenovo wants to establish itself as an innovator in the smartphone industry. \u00b5"]}, "BASF": {"2014-09-15": ["Meeting in Geneva over the weekend, Ukrainian and Russian business leaders proposed a 10-point plan that seeks to end the conflict in the region and stabilize Ukraine's economy by building trade bridges to both Russia and the European Union.\n\nThe initiative was organized by Klaus Schwab, who heads the renowned World Economic Forum that meets in Davos every January.\n\nOther notable participants included Anatoly Chubais, who was the so-called privatization \"czar\" in post-Cold War Russia under the presidency of Boris Yeltsin, as well as Ukrainian investor and philanthropist Victor Pinchuk and Kurt Bock, chairman of the German chemical giant BASF.

Europe's gas production is declining, making greater Russian market share politically controversial but in reality highly likely.\n\nGazprom has been seeking direct access to lucrative European energy consumers for years rather than relying on middlemen.\n\nReduced natural gas deliveries out of Russia to Europe are within normal fluctuation ranges, Moehring said.\n\n\"We also saw lower volumes arrive ... but that is no reason for concern and is within normal limits which we also saw in previous years when full capacity was not needed,\" he said in an interview during a conference on Friday.\n\n\"Traders know this and accordingly, prices have not seriously responded, which we see as proof for our assessment,\" he added.\n\nRussia, which supplies a third of European gas, by some is seen as flexing its muscles as it is locked in a sanctions tit-for-tat with the EU over Ukraine.\n\nSlovakia said on Monday it was getting less gas than requested and Poland said Sunday it had received less on Saturday after the two, as well as Romania and Austria, reported lower than ordered import receipts last week.\n\nBut Moehring said it was not unusual to fill stocks in Russia's giant gas pool, and carry out maintenance before the winter season when cold temperatures make this impossible.\n\nHelped by a warm first half of the year, European utilities have injected as much gas into storage this summer as possible in order to prepare for any potential disruption of gas flows from Russia. Supplies this summer have been lower than last year, but significantly higher than two years ago.\n\nExpanding availability at Europe's spot trading hubs has also allowed buying gas at around an estimated 5 to 15 percent discount to volumes in fixed long-term deals, traders have said.\n\nEU gas stocks on Sunday were 90.32 percent full, according to Gas Infrastructure Group Europe, or GIE.\n\nThe British October delivery contract at 51.30 pence a therm on Monday was 5 percent below its levels of 54 pence in May.

The band consists of Adam Granduciel (vocals, guitar), David Hartley (bass, guitar), Robbie Bennett (keyboards, guitar) and Patrick Berkery (drums).\n\nFounded by close collaborators Granduciel and Kurt Vile, The War on Drugs released their debut studio album, \"Wagonwheel Blues,'' in 2008. Vile departed shortly after the album release to focus on his solo career.\n\nThe band's second studio album Slave Ambient was released in 2011 to critical acclaim and extensive touring. A third album, Lost in the Dream, was released in March 2014.\n\nIslands: In July 2013, Nick Thorburn began hinting at a new Islands album. He soon posted a link to the band's website on Facebook revealing the upcoming release of a new album called \"Ski Mask.'' The first single, \"Wave Forms,'' was released in 2013 via SoundCloud. Released last September, Islands' latest album, \"Ski Mask,'' showcases Thorburn at his \"predictably unpredictable\" best. A record that is equal parts beauty and venom, \"Ski Mask\" percolates with the kind of polymorphous pop and hooky, left-of-center rock songs that have long been the band's stock and trade.\n\nCOM TRUISE: Com Truise is one of the many personas of producer and designer Seth Haley, born and raised in upstate New York and operating out of a 12-foot-overrun apartment in Princeton, New Jersey. An admitted synth obsessive, Com Truise is the maker of an experimental and bottom heavy style he calls \"mid-fi synth-wave, slow-motion funk\".\n\nHaley's been making music on the side for roughly a decade -- going through pseudonyms like toothbrushes (Sarin Sunday, SYSTM, Airliner) -- first as a DJ, and currently, as an excavator of softer, window-fogging synth-wave.\n\nWhile subliminally informed by both parental record collections and hints of faded electronics product design, Haley's Com Truise project isn't just nostalgia capitalization. There are fragments (read: DNA strands) of Joy Division, New Order, and the Cocteau Twins, but it's like you're hearing them through the motherboard of a waterlogged Xbox -- demented and modern. He's got a way of making familiar things sound beautifully hand-smeared.\n\nThe first Com Truise release was the Cyanide Sisters EP -- distributed for free on the AMdiscs label -- where mellow stone-outs like \"Sundriped\" and \"Slow Peels\" sat next to harder IDM bangers (\"BASF Ace\" and \"IWYWAW\") and bumpy alt-funk trips (\"Norkuy\" and \"Komputer\"). After that came a single \"Pyragony/Trypyra,\" and a series of eclectic podcast mixes titled \"Komputer Cast.\" Now comfortably situated amidst the Ghostly roster, he's prepping his next warped pillage, and hopefully not changing that name again.\n\nPomplamoose: Pomplamoose is an American musical duo featuring Californian multi-instrumentalists and real-life couple Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn. The duo formed in the summer of 2008 and sold approximately 100,000 songs online in 2009. They are known for their diverse music style that the band refuses to put a label towards.\n\nIn 2011, Pomplamoose began a weekly, interactive, half-hour webcast called \"Hey, It's Pomplamoose: A Show about Pomplamoose and Other Things\" that airs every Tuesday. After the March 29 show, the webcast was put on hiatus until their East Coast tour was completed. The tour included Ryan Lerman, Carlos Cabrera, and Lauren O'Connell as backing band and opening act. For the Washington, D.C., show, Pomplamoose opened for OK Go, also known for their YouTube videos.\n\nOn Nov. 5, 2013, Pomplamoose launched its second season -- a three-part sequel to the band's early years, including but not limited to: videos, a tour and an album (to be released July 29th).\n\nJustin Townes Earle: After two and a half years since his last release, Justin Townes Earle is back and pleased to announce his fifth studio album (and first ever on Vagrant Records). Entitled \"Single Mothers,'' the record will be released nationwide on Sept 9, and Justin will be on the road in the US throughout September and early October to support it.\n\n\"Single Mothers'' is comprised of 10 tracks that showcase exactly why Justin Townes Earle is considered a forefather of Contemporary Americana. As a recently married, sober man JTE writes from a point of maturity and content not seen on past records.\n\n\"One day I just realized it's not cool to die young, and it's even less cool to die after 30,\" Justin laughs as he reflects on life and his new found clarity. What he's created is an album that's raw, honest and personal in a way he hasn't touched upon since his debut EP, \"Yuma.''\n\nOnce compared to a man who wears many suits JTE has experienced more than most, both personally and professionally, in 32 short years. Between releasing four full-length-critically acclaimed albums, constant touring, multiple stints in rehab, being born Steve Earle's son, amicable and not-so-amicable break-ups with record labels, and facing the trials and tribulations of everyday life, it's safe to say JTE has quite the story to tell. \"Single Mothers'' serves as the perfect platform for such narrations.\n\nrjd2: rjd2 began his career in Columbus, Ohio, DJing in 1993 with a pair of turntables bought from a friend. He claims his name originates from another friend who referenced him as \"rjd2\" in his raps, and the name stuck.\n\nOriginally working the role of DJ in the Columbus rap group MHz, he later signed to Bobbito Garcia's Fondle 'Em label, releasing the self-proclaimed \"mix CD\" \"Your Face Or Your Kneecaps.'' A year later he signed to El-P's record label Definitive Jux and released his solo debut album \"Deadringer'' to much acclaim. rjd2 later collaborated with Columbus rapper Blueprint under the name Soul Position, releasing \"Unlimited EP'' in 2002 and \"8 Million Stories'' in 2003. He released his second solo album \"Since We Last Spoke'' on Definitive Jux in 2004, which blended hip-hop with elements of pop and was lauded as one of the year's Top 40 Albums by SPIN.\n\nHe later contributed a cover of \"Airbag\" by Radiohead for the 2006 album Exit Music - the same year that saw the release of the collaborative record, \"Magnificent City,\" with Aceyalone. Fully indulging his passion for pop, rjd2 released another solo album, \"The Third Hand,'' on XL Recordings and toured extensively through 2008.\n\nThe innovative producer's 10-year career reached a marked turning point in 2009 after he scored \"A Beautiful Mine,\" the popular theme to the hit AMC television series, \"Mad Men.'' In early 2010, he dropped \"The Colossus'' -- the first album to be released on his own label, RJ's Electrical Connections. He has since reissued \"Your Face Or Your Knee Caps,'' \"The Horror'' and \"Since We Last Spoke'' as well as a vinyl LP deluxe box set entitled \"2002-2010'' via his label.\n\nFreeman: Listening to \"Marvelous Clouds,'' Aaron Freeman's 2012 debut under his own name, fans might have felt that he was ignoring an elephant in his room -- a drug-and-alcohol-related onstage flame-out that made viral headlines the year before.\n\nBut Clouds, a deceptively chill Rod McKuen covers record, was just a warm-up for the artist once known as Gene Ween. In the opening minutes of \"FREEMAN,'' the self-titled debut from his new band, Freeman addresses addiction and its aftermath with the combination of merciless self-inventory and artful songcraft that earned Ween one of the most devoted fan bases in contemporary pop. The unmistakably autobiographical \"Covert Discretion,\" is a quiet shocker. \"Save your judgments for someone else,\" Freeman sings. \"Be grateful I saved me from myself.\"\n\nAs bitter as it sounds, the track clears the air. \"FREEMAN'' represents a new beginning -- Aaron Freeman's first album of original material since disbanding Ween and getting sober -- but it isn't a record mired in its maker's private struggles. It's simply a collection of gorgeous, subtly offbeat songs -- in other words, a continuation of the thread that runs through the entire Ween catalog. The lush psychedelic pop of \"The English and Western Stallion\"; the melancholy plea of \"More Than the World\"; the unflappable, Plastic Ono Band-esque blues-rock of \"Gimmie One More\" -- these are songs that bear the unmistakable Aaron Freeman stamp.", "The anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America is Thursday, and in Baton Rouge, employees of the BASF Plant will pack almost 200 care packages for local troops who have been deployed for the country to places around the world.\n\nAnyone who wishes to contribute can bring personal hygiene items for homeless veterans to a collection point in the Food Court of the Mall of Louisiana's east entrance.\n\nVeterans are also urged to bring their resumes for bring their resumes for visit about 30 potential employers at the Mall of Louisiana, on the second floor near the Food Court. The Veterans Career fair will last from noon- 6 p.m.", "BASF has developed a new process for steering its portfolio based on sustainability criteria.\n\nThe Sustainable Solution Steering method is used to systematically review and evaluate the sustainability aspects of the about 50,000 relevant product applications in the company's portfolio, which represent sales of 56 billion euros ($72 billion).\n\nThe company says this externally validated process makes it possible to measure the products' contribution to sustainability within their various markets and industries and to increase this contribution through targeted steps.\n\nOver the past three years, BASF has already analyzed more than 80 percent of its portfolio of around 50,000 specific product applications. The data shows, for example, how a product contributes to cost effectiveness and resource conservation as well as to health and safety. The concrete sustainability requirements of various customer industries are taken into account as well as regional differences. The process determines the extent to which BASF products can accommodate these needs.\n\nBased on the results to date, the analyzed product applications have been sorted into four categories:\n\nSustainable Solution Steering aims to increase the number of Accelerator products in the long term in order to further improve the sustainability profile of both BASF and its customers. To this end, the product portfolio is under continual review, which means that this four-category segmentation is also subject to change, for example, in response to altered market requirements or new legislation.\n\nBASF says it will analyze the whole product portfolio by the end of 2014.\n\nEighty-one percent of mainstream chemical producers say it's very or moderately important to be a front runner in sustainable chemicals, according to a survey by Genomatica and ICIS published earlier this week.\n\nIn addition, respondents said they viewed BASF, DuPont, Dow, Bayer and Genomatica as the leaders in sustainable technology.", "WASHINGTON (AP) - The powerful chemical industry is putting its lobbying muscle behind legislation that would establish standards for chemicals used in products from household goods to cellphones and plastic water bottles - but also make it tougher for states to enact their own regulations.\n\nMany states already have acted on their own - and that's what's gotten the industry's attention.\n\n\"Rather than be picked apart on a state-by-state basis, with different regulations, we needed to have a coherent and cohesive federal system,\" said Anne Kolton, spokeswoman for the American Chemistry Council.\n\nThe group, which represents such chemical powerhouses as Dow, DuPont, BASF Corp. and 3M, spent nearly $6 million on lobbying in the first half of the year, the most recent reporting period.\n\nThere's widespread agreement that the current law needs an overhaul. Chemical manufacturers aren't required to develop new data on toxicity and exposure, which has led to products containing chemicals that haven't been screened for safety. The President's Cancer Panel said in 2010 that act \"may be the most egregious example of ineffective regulation of environmental contaminants.\"\n\nBut a big sticking point is the role of the states in regulating chemicals.\n\nRegulation of chemicals took on new urgency after a crippling spill in West Virginia last January contaminated drinking water for 300,000 residents. The chemical in the January spill, crude MCHM, is one of thousands not regulated under current law.\n\n\"West Virginia certainly raised the visibility of chemical hazards and vividly illustrated some of the failings of our current system,\" said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., who chairs a subcommittee on toxics. But he added that the need for change predates the spill and has continued to grow.\n\nWest Virginia which has not aggressively regulated chemicals, supports the Senate bill. It would require safety evaluations for all chemicals and give the Environmental Protection Agency authority to take action against chemicals deemed unsafe - ranging from labeling requirements to a ban. It would also overtake some state regulations - primarily when EPA takes action to regulate a chemical.\n\n\"Those states with existing programs need to be protected while those of us with nothing need and deserve better,\" said Michael Dorsey, chief of homeland security and emergency response for the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nCalifornia, by comparison, has some of the toughest chemical regulations in the country. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is fighting to preserve state regulations. She said under the bill, states \"face sweeping pre-emption even when there is no meaningful action by the federal government.\"\n\nIn a letter to Congress last year, California EPA Secretary Matt Rodriquez said dozens of California laws and regulations would be at risk if the bill passes, including those regulating greenhouse gases and safe drinking water. New York's attorney general has raised similar concerns. Regulation by states such as California and New York can have a national impact because of their large markets.\n\nSeveral of ACC's larger members, including Bayer Corp., DuPont and Dow Chemical, lobbied on the Senate bill in the first half of the year. Connie Deford, Dow's director of product sustainability and compliance, said the company supports the framework of the Senate bill.\n\n\"We believe it's critical for our industry that we have a stronger federal chemical management system than where we sit today,\" Deford said.\n\nOutgunned financially, environmentalists have sometimes used star power to help illuminate their cause, but that hasn't been enough to overcome industry opposition. The Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coalition had teamed up with actresses including Jessica Alba to promote different legislation. The bill never got a vote in Congress.\n\nIn a recent interview, Alba said she can't compete with lobbyists despite the media attention she brought to the issue.\n\n\"You can have certain public figures go in and advocate and raise a red flag and put a spotlight on an issue, but at the end of the day, it's people that are there day in and day out, that are pounding the pavement,\" said Alba, who launched the Honest Company to sell ecofriendly and toxin-free baby products and household items.\n\nThe American Chemistry Council opposed the environmentalist-backed bill, arguing its safety standards were unachievable. A few senators, including Udall, responded to the council with a tongue-lashing at a 2011 hearing.\n\nBut now the council is aligned with Udall on chemical regulation. Last year, after Udall took over as the lead Democratic sponsor of the industry-backed bill, the council made a six-figure ad buy on several New Mexico TV stations praising him as a senator who \"brings both sides together to get results.\"\n\nAn occasional look at how behind-the-scenes influence is wielded in Washington.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Tom Udall, D-N.M., and David Vitter of Louisiana, the top Republican on the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, provided a revised draft of their chemical regulation bill to committee chairwoman Barbara Boxer, who told The Associated Press this week that the draft still falls short.\n\nThe original bill had been panned by some environmental groups, such as Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, who assailed it as \"phony reform,\" although the Environmental Defense Fund supported its introduction as a chance for an eventual breakthrough.\n\nAt stake is a rewrite of the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, known as TSCA, which is widely seen as an ineffective law to protect Americans from harmful chemicals.\n\nWhile the new Senate draft hasn't been released publicly, Udall told the AP that it makes \"big progress\" in the safety standard; protections for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, infants, children and workers; and strong deadlines for the EPA to work through chemicals.\n\nOne area that remains outstanding, Udall said, is how much federal law should take precedence over state regulations, which negotiators will turn to next. States such as California, which have come up with their own regulations in the absence of federal action, have warned that the language in the bill could jeopardize dozens of California laws and regulations.\n\nBoxer, a Democrat from California, said that the latest draft is still too sweeping in its nullification of state regulations. Udall agreed that the pre-emption language in the original bill is much too broad and needs to be narrowed.\n\nThe attempt to come up with new chemical regulation legislation has shifted from a Democratic bill, the Safe Chemicals Act in the previous session of Congress, to the industry-backed bipartisan Chemical Safety Improvement Act. The American Chemistry Council, a trade group which represents such chemical powerhouses as Dow, DuPont, BASF Corp. and 3M, says that reforming TSCA is its top legislative priority. The ACC spent nearly $6 million in lobbying expenses in the first half of the year.\n\nUdall said that while he supported the Safe Chemicals Act, \"without any bipartisan support and (with) wholesale industry opposition it simply couldn't move forward. A new approach was needed that could get the support needed to actually get it to the president's desk.\"\n\n\"The new draft is a giant leap forward from the last one,\" Udall added. \"And most important is that it is a huge improvement compared to the law as it stands now, and as it has stood since 1976.\"\n\nBut Boxer, in her first public comments on the draft, said the draft doesn't make the changes needed to improve current law.\n\n\"The proposed safety standard does not clearly reject the ineffective standard contained in the original TSCA law that has resulted in very limited protection,\" she said. Boxer said timelines in the draft \"remain extremely long - it is expected to take at least seven years before even a tiny fraction of the chemicals of concern are reviewed. This could leave nearly a thousand chemicals of greatest concern unaddressed.\"\n\nRegulation of chemicals took on new urgency after a crippling spill in West Virginia last January contaminated drinking water for 300,000 residents. The chemical in the January spill, crude MCHM, is one of thousands not regulated under current law.\n\nBoxer said she'll be proposing a provision that will specifically address toxic chemicals that could threaten drinking water supplies.\n\nThe director of Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, Andy Igrejas, said that there's been progress made to improve the bill over the past few months.\n\n\"We have not seen a version that resolves all the issues leading to a clear improvement for public health and safety,\" he said, but added he was hopeful that negotiations among key senators could lead to such a bill.\n\nRichard Denison, lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said that there are incentives for both sides to have a stronger system.\n\n\"We're still optimistic that even if doesn't happen in this Congress, that all of that work that's been done provides a path forward to actually getting a bill passed,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

That complements a deal by Ineos to import gas from the U.S., a step followed by other chemical companies in Europe such as Borealis AG and Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Scotland will vote Sept. 18 on whether to stay in the U.K.\n\nProducers of everything from fertilizers to plastics are looking for new energy sources at a time when options are limited. Shale exploration has helped boost supply and depress prices in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K. and Poland have embraced fracking -- blasting water, sand and chemicals to harvest fuel embedded deep underground -- while most of the rest of the continent, citing environmental harm, has not. The challenge has become urgent given the European Union's dependence on Russia for 30 percent of its supplies, much via pipelines in Ukraine.\n\n\"If Europe doesn't develop indigenous shale, then it will not have an energy-intensive industry in the next 20 years,\" Tom Crotty, an Ineos director, said in an interview in London. \"It's that black and white. We will kill the industry.\"\n\nScotland may hold 80.3 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, according to the British Geological Survey. The Scottish government proposes \"a cautious and considered approach\" to unconventional resources, as opposed to the U.K. government's plans to allow drilling below people's homes and land, according to the Scottish National Party, the largest in the region's parliament.\n\nThe EU faces the risk of industry drain due to lower energy prices in the U.S., Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said in June. Thirty million jobs in energy-intensive industries are in peril, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. The bloc's share of sales in the 3.1 trillion euro ($4 trillion) global chemicals industry dropped to 18 percent in 2012 from about 30 percent in 2004, according to the European Chemical Industry Council.\n\nNatural gas prices in the U.S. have fallen as the shale gas revolution boosted output by 27 percent in the six years through 2013, according to IHS Inc., an Englewood, Colorado-based research firm. The benchmark price in the U.K., Europe's biggest market, is more than double the price in the U.S.\n\nEU gas output fell 58 percent between 2001 and 2012, Eurostat figures show. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine threatens to disrupt supplies this winter, echoing similar disputes that caused shortages in parts of Europe in 2006 and 2009.\n\nShale gas output in the U.K. and Poland won't be enough to reverse the decline in European domestic gas production, the IEA said in June.\n\n\"We're not developing indigenous gas supplies,\" Crotty said. \"We're massively dependent on Russia, and the political instability is growing and not diminishing. All of that points to gas prices in Europe increasing.\"\n\nU.K. gas will average 52.5 pence a therm in 2015, compared with 48.2 pence a therm this year, Citigroup Inc. said in a July 14 report.\n\nThe U.K.'s support for shale exploration enabled Ineos, based in Rolle, Switzerland, to consider fracking. Other projects are hampered by national restrictions. Shale gas requires millions of gallons of water laced with acids and other additives, and environmental groups including Food & Water Watch in Washington and Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International have sought bans because of concerns about drinking water contamination.\n\nEnergy costs are reducing the EU's ability to attract investment in everything from chemicals to steel, said Steinar Solheim, an official with the International Federation of Industrial Energy Consumers and vice president of energy sourcing at fertilizer maker Yara International ASA in Oslo.\n\n\"Nobody will even think about investing in a new ammonia plant in Europe these days,\" Solheim said. Ammonia is used to make fertilizers.\n\nSince 2009, the majority if not all the investments to develop new ethylene projects have been outside Europe, said Elena Nadtotchi, a senior credit officer at Moody's Corp. in London. Ethylene is a gas that helps make chemicals used in plastics and detergents.\n\nEnergy accounts for more than 50 percent of the cost of making petrochemicals, according to the IEA. Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF SE, the world's largest chemical company, said it will for the first time allocate less than half of its investments to Europe over the next five years. Ineos won't build any new facilities on the continent, Crotty said.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Atlantic, \"excellent economics\" are attracting investors for new ethylene plants in the U.S., which when ready in about three years will increase competition for manufacturers in Europe, Nadtotchi said.\n\nInvestors plan to spend $124 billion on new and expanded petrochemical factories in the U.S., according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\n\"With output that far outstrips demand growth in the U.S., huge amounts are going to be targeted for export,\" said Ineos's Crotty. \"Where is it going to export to? Well, Europe is looking pretty attractive.\"\n\nTo keep up with the competition, Ineos, which uses ethane as its feedstock, signed a series of 15- to 20-year contracts to ship the gas from Pennsylvania's Marcellus field to its facilities in Europe. The first shipment is expected to arrive at the company's Rafnes plant in Norway next year, cutting ethylene production costs there by about half, Moody's estimated in an April 15 report. Grangemouth is scheduled to get its first Pennsylvania ethane in 2016, Crotty said.\n\nIneos moved into the fracking business by buying a 51 percent stake in a shale license from Reading, England-based BG Group Plc. Dart Energy Ltd., a Brisbane, Australia-based driller, owns the rest of the claim.\n\nIneos said it will poke around for gas in the 329 square kilometers (127 square miles) around its Grangemouth refinery. The facility almost closed last year as a shortage of feedstock meant its cracker, which processes ethane to make ethylene, had been running at less than 50 percent of capacity for the past two years, Crotty said.\n\n\"The issue we faced was a straightforward one of lack of supply,\" he said. \"Had Grangemouth closed last October, it would have had a massive impact. We've got 800 jobs in the petrochemicals site, but you are probably talking about five to 10 times that number of jobs in the community.\"\n\nThere's no sufficient data from U.K. test wells to determine how much shale gas can be recovered and at what cost, according to a July report by the National Grid Plc, which operates the country's energy system. Without production from shale rock, the U.K. may need to boost its dependence on gas imports to 91 percent from 56 percent by 2035, exposing the nation to global prices for the fuel, the report said.\n\nEurope will take longer than the U.S. to develop its shale gas resources because of tougher structural and regulatory conditions, Fitch Ratings said in a report last month.\n\n\"We anticipate five or more years of exploration are required to identify the economically viable reserves if any, following which we expect another five to eight years before production actually takes place,\" Stephane Buemi and Josef Pospisil, analysts at Fitch in London, said in an Aug. 26 report.\n\nChemical makers in Europe have found alternative energy sources. While Vienna-based Borealis said it's not currently considering fracking, it signed a 10-year agreement with Denver- based Antero Resources Corp. to ship 240,000 tons a year of ethane from the Marcellus and Utica fields in the U.S. to its facility in Stenungsund, Sweden, starting in 2016, said Markku Korvenranta, executive vice president of base chemicals.\n\nSabic, based in Riyadh, will convert its facility in Teesside, England, to shale gas as feedstock, with changes ready by 2016, the company said Aug. 21.\n\n\"Borealis for sure, and I believe the same for all of the industry, will have to take some measures to remain globally competitive,\" Korvenranta said. \"It's surprising that the politicians and the EU are not more pronouncedly in favor of shale gas exploration. It will be one way of addressing the decline in natural gas production.\"", "Ludwigshafen, Germany and Antwerp, Belgium - September 11, 2014 - Strengthening of Antwerp Verbund site: BASF today announced the start-up of a new butadiene extraction plant at its Verbund site in Antwerp, Belgium. The plant has an annual production capacity of 155,000 metric tons.\n\nThe plant in Antwerp is BASF's second butadiene extraction plant in Europe. BASF already operates a butadiene extraction plant at its Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, with an annual production capacity of 105,000 metric tons. With the plant in Antwerp, BASF is more than doubling its production capacity for butadiene in Europe.\n\n\"This plant secures our internal supply with butadiene at competitive costs,\" said Dr. Uwe Kirchg\u00e4\u00dfner, head of BASF's regional business unit Basic Petrochemicals Europe. \"In addition, it enables us to take advantage of opportunities on the external market and strengthens our market position in Europe.\"\n\nThe butadiene will be extracted from crude C4, a product from the steam cracker. \"With the new plant we are further developing the integration of the C4 value chain in Antwerp,\" said Wouter de Geest, CEO of BASF Antwerpen NV. \"This important investment strengthens the Verbund at the Antwerp site.\"\n\nButadiene is a raw material that can be used to produce synthetic rubber, among other applications. The tire industry is one of the main consumers of butadiene. Other applications for butadiene include plastics production and paper chemicals.\n\nAt BASF, we create chemistry - and have been doing so for 150 years. Our portfolio ranges from chemicals, plastics, performance products and crop protection products to oil and gas. As the world's leading chemical company, we combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility. Through science and innovation, we enable our customers in nearly every industry to meet the current and future needs of society. Our products and solutions contribute to conserving resources, ensuring nutrition and improving quality of life.

BASF shares are traded on the stock exchanges in Frankfurt (BAS), London (BFA) and Zurich (AN).", "Genomatica announced the latest results from the use of their proprietary, integrated biotechnology platform. Genomatica uses their platform to develop processes that harness biotechnology as an integral part of converting alternative feedstocks to major chemicals. Genomatica leveraged their platform to create microorganisms that achieved a 'titer' (concentration of product) of over 50 grams per liter for one of their programs in less than half the time required by an earlier program. This level is a relevant milestone on the path toward a commercial process and highlights one of the major aspects of the platform - its ability to rapidly engineer microorganisms to produce chemicals that may not be naturally produced by a chosen microbe.\n\nGenomatica's first commercial process, GENO BDO\u2122, was developed using their platform and was notable for three reasons: the company reached commercial-scale production in only five years; the process directly converts feedstocks to a chemical that is not naturally produced; and the thousands of tons of BDO produced to date continues to lead the industry in production of a high-volume intermediate chemical from renewable feedstocks. The BDO program required 27 months to reach over 50 grams per liter. The latest example was achieved as part of Genomatica's butadiene development program. In this program, too, Genomatica is using its platform to design a microorganism and process to make a chemical that is not naturally produced; and in this case, only 10 months were needed to reach the 50 grams per liter. Genomatica believes this improved performance represents the high leverage that can be achieved from their integrated biotechnology platform.\n\n\"Our biotechnology platform enabled us to deliver a commercial process for BDO in only five years, even though we were still establishing some of the key elements back then,\" said Mark Burk, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Genomatica. \"Now, we have more thoroughly integrated our computational and experimental capabilities, especially with regard to certain high-throughput and precision experimentation technologies. This puts us in a position to take full advantage of our platform for butadiene and nylon intermediates and beyond. Pragmatically, a good technology platform should drive down cost and timelines to commercialization. We intend to put our proven asset to good use as we work with industry partners to develop and commercialize processes for additional chemicals.\"\n\nGenomatica is a widely-recognized technology leader for the chemical industry. It develops manufacturing processes that enable its licensee partners to produce the world's most widely-used chemicals a 'better way,' from alternative feedstocks, with better economics and greater sustainability than petroleum-based processes.\n\nGenomatica has delivered the industry's first commercial biobased process for a high-volume intermediate chemical. Its GENO BDO\u2122 process has produced thousands of tons of BDO and been licensed by BASF and Novamont. Multiple large chemical firms have publicly validated quality or described commercialization plans, including Invista (for its well-known Lycra\u00ae spandex), DSM, Lanxess, Toray, and Far Eastern New Century.\n\nGenomatica's biotechnology platform and over 500 patents and applications enable it to develop processes for additional major chemicals. The next is for butadiene, with Versalis and Braskem as partners, and over $100 million in industry support. Genomatica has also announced a program to develop processes for the production of nylon intermediates, including HMD, caprolactam and adipic acid.\n\nGenomatica has earned tremendous recognition for its innovation, commercialization track record, and potential for broad impact. This recognition includes the Kirkpatrick Award, for 'the most noteworthy chemical engineering technology commercialized in the world,' and the 2015 World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer award."], "2014-09-16": ["Hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\"--which refers to the practice of injecting fluid into the ground to break rock and access underlying fossil fuels--is highly controversial, particularly in the US. Environmentalists in particular have expressed concern about the huge amounts of water used in the process. But like it or not, fracking is practiced almost all over the world. This article explores economies of selected countries with significant fracking potential and its impact on the overall economy. (Already investing in fuel? You really should check out Investopedia's article, \"How Shale Fracking May Hurt Your Investment.\")\n\nFirst things first. The \"To Frack or not to Frack?\" question only makes sense in places that have recoverable shale oil or shale gas resources to begin with. If there's no fuel in the ground, fracking is a moot point. As per the Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, the following is the list of the top 10 countries for shale oil and shale gas resources:\n\nA few of these countries have managed to explore the available resources efficiently (like US), while others (like Algeria, China and Canada) are in the initiation mode. European countries like France and the UK face environmental concerns and local bans, Argentina & Mexico struggle with geopolitical effects and unclear policies, rest like Pakistan have it untapped due to lack of technology. Let's look at some key players:\n\nUSA\n\nA well-structured initiative approach followed by the US for fracking has enabled a decline of around 37.5% in the natural gas imports between 2007 and 2013. Further fracking may lead to the US becoming a net exporter of natural gas and the largest oil producer in 2020, leaving behind Russia and Saudi Arabia. Much of America's oil is in private land,s which enables the private sector to override government bureaucracy. This kind of shortcut is not available in all nations.\n\nBut what's the reality at the overall national level? Has the US economy really benefited significantly?\n\nA Washington Post report from 2013 indicates that since the oil and gas sectors account for only 2.5% of the GDP, the net contribution is only 0.6 percentage points of the overall 7.6% rise in GDP. This was the case when volume of oil and gas extraction rose by 24%, related mining machinery rose by 47% and output of mining support increased by 58%.\n\nAnother report, from the Paris-based IDDRI, suggests that the impact of hydraulic fracturing on the level of the US GDP will be a meager 0.84% between 2012 and 2035.\n\nAnalysts cite the US example as an unfortunate case of overproduction. One such analyst, Richard Heinberg of the Post Carbon Institute, writes in his book Snake Oil: How Fracking's False Promise of Plenty Imperils Our Future (excerpt on resilience.org): \"Gas prices have been driven down to a level below industry's production cost\". From a national standpoint, \"low prices can be viewed as one of the economic benefits of shale development, but fracking has resulted in the industry itself being hurt by low prices\" and hence, the author claims, fracking makes no significant contributions to the economy.\n\nIndividual US State data, however, shows the ostensible side benefits of fracking:\n\nThe energy advancements have revitalized other sectors in U.S. like manufacturing, petrochemicals, and steel. Oil company Shell, German chemical company BASF, Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine, South African Sasol and France's Vallourec are all expected to invest heavily in the US, riding on the associated sectors for facilitating hydraulic fracturing.\n\nAlgeria\n\nThe third largest shale gas reserves are estimated to be in the fossil-fuel rich Algeria, which has already taken measures to tap into its shale gas reserves. Amid continued local opposition, an 2012 amendment of rules allows foreign companies to invest in Algeria's shale gas sector, with tax breaks and variable royalty taxes. Algeria's chemical company, Sonatrach, has entered into agreements with multinational corporations (MNCs) like Shell, ENI and Talisman, to sell the gas into European markets. This has resulted in increased employment opportunities, an increase in investments and better energy security for Algeria, apart from the positive impact on its economy.\n\nEuropean Countries\n\nFrance and Bulgaria have banned fracking. Germany has raised concerns. The UK witnesses on and off behavior, with limited fracking activity - all due to environmental concerns and unclear policies.\n\nThe top list of fracking nations does not include these countries, but they do have fuel volume worth exploring. Most being developed countries, Europe's energy demands are higher. Apart from the economic impact, exploring the untapped potential of fracking in a balanced manner may result in energy efficiency for these countries.\n\nEven British PM David Cameron has acknowledged the positive effects of fracking on US economy: \"There is no doubt that when it comes to re-shoring in the US, one of the most important factors has been the development of shale gas, which is flooring US energy prices, with billions of dollars of energy cost-savings predicted over the next decade.\"\n\nChina\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that China is currently the leader for shale gas and the third biggest in shale oil reserves. China has already embarked on exploring its fracking potential with local (CNPC, Sinopec) as well as international companies (Royal Dutch, Chevron CVX). National strategies, possibly a part of the government's five year plan, are expected to have tax benefits and subsidies for fracking. As of now, no numbers are available, but these developments indicate China's preparedness and willingness to explore its untapped potential to gain self-sufficiency and economic benefits on the energy front.\n\nHowever, a few challenges are also haunting the Chinese venture. Despite estimates that China may have much larger reserves than currently estimated, the basic infrastructure does not seem to be in place to support its exploitation. Lack of pipeline systems, water shortages, different chemical composition of extracts needing different treatment, the lack of technology, etc. will be major challenges to overcome. Eventually, though, China may become self-dependent for its energy needs.\n\nArgentina:\n\nArgentina already has over 150 shale wells in production and the nation continues to warmly welcome companies bringing in large ticket investments, looking at fracking as a road to economic recovery. Argentina is the biggest consumer of natural gas in the continent, with 10 billion USD worth of gas imports, a figure almost equal to its trade deficit. Irrespective of all environmental concerns and geopolitical challenges, the fracking business does have the potential to bring economic respite to Argentina, a country struggling with high inflation and financial stress.\n\nMexico:\n\nThe nation with the \"closed\" oil-sector where the state oil company Pemex has a monopoly, Mexico is expected to change gears and open up the sector to privatization. Between 2005 and 2013, the oil and gas sector contribution to overall government revenue has dipped from 41% to 30%. Opening up fracking ventures to private companies is expected to bring foreign investments and economic recovery for Mexico.\n\nSouth Africa:\n\nFracking in South Africa has seen increased interest from international oil companies like Shell SA (RDS.A), Bundu Gas & Oil and Falcon Gas & Oil.\n\nReports suggest that fracking will fulfill the country's energy needs and is expected to add 23 billion USD to the country's GDP, with 700,000 new jobs to be created. Challenges to address will be building and maintaining the required infrastructure.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDepending upon local, geopolitical and infrastructure or global pricing factors, fracking may or may not contribute significantly to a state's or nation's economy. However, there is clear evidence on fracking benefits in terms of improved production, thereby leading to self-reliance for the energy needs of an economy. Countries that take a balanced approach to reap the benefits and address concerns for all stakeholders can be the clear winners.", "A team of researchers from Cargill Inc., BASF and Novozymes said Monday that they've achieved a milestone in producing acrylic acid from renewable materials to reduce industry's dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nThe three companies have been working together since 2012 to develop a bio-based source of acrylic acid, which has many uses in consumer products.\n\nMost acrylic acid is synthesized from refining crude oil, but the team said they've successfully converted 3-hydroxypropionic acid (made by genetically modified microorganisms) into glacial acrylic acid and superabsorbent polymers.\n\nThe new renewable product will likely be used in a wide range of consumer products, such as paints, plastics, fiber, coatings and especially diapers and hygiene products that require extreme absorbency.\n\n\"Cargill came together with BASF and Novozymes to do what had not been done ever before,\" said Jack Staloch, vice president of research and development at Wayzata-based Cargill, in a news release.\n\nThe companies said they will set up a pilot plant, operated by Cargill, by the end of this year to scale up production.\n\nBASF, the world's largest producer of acrylic acid, is based in Ludwigshafen, Germany.

We have been working together for less than two years and we have made great progress toward our common goal,\" said Jack Staloch, vice president of research and development at Cargill.\n\nMark Anderson covers technology, banking and finance, medtech and biotech, venture capital, energy, mining, hotels, restaurants and tourism for the Sacramento Business Journal."]}, "Apple": {"2014-09-15": ["NEW HAVEN -- On the ninth day, it was former Gov. John G. Rowland's turn to present his story, through his defense team.\n\nThe former governor, who had spent two weeks at his trial taking notes, nervously twirling his glasses and often conferring with his wife, Patty, spied 16 jurors as Brian Bedard, the chief executive officer of Apple Rehab, told them Rowland did consulting work for the nursing home group by offering \"substantive\" advice on labor relations, Medicaid reimbursements and more.\n\n\"Did it ever occur to you that this was a pretext -- that this was a show providing cover for campaign work?\" Reid Weingarten, Rowland's attorney, asked Bedard.\n\n\"No. Absolutely not,\" said Bedard who confirmed at least six meetings involving Rowland.\n\n\"Our meetings were very informal, but there was always a healthy exchange of ideas,\" Bedard said.\n\nHis testimony marked the first inroads the defense made into the prosecution's claim that Rowland was working primarily for Lisa Wilson-Foley's 5th Congressional District Republican campaign while actually being paid through Apple Rehab, a conglomerate of 26 nursing homes owned by her husband, Brian Foley.\n\nFoley has testified that he devised a plan to pay Rowland through his business to avoid negative publicity that would have come if the ex-governor's salary and position were listed in Federal Election Commission reports. In 2004, Rowland resigned as governor and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of accepting gifts from state contractors. The following year, he was sentenced to 366 days in prison.\n\nPhone, email records tell their story\n\nFoley's claim of a cover-up led to him and his wife pleading guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge of conspiring to falsify federal election campaign contributions. Their pleas led to this trial of Rowland in U.S. District Court on seven charges of violating federal elections laws.\n\n\"Did you know Mr. Rowland also was working for Lisa on her campaign?\" Weingarten asked Bedard.\n\n\"I was aware at some point, but just actually what he was doing, I don't know,\" the witness replied.\n\nThe prosecution claims Rowland was working primarily for the campaign, being paid $5,000 a month and using the Apple job as a cover.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Liam Brennan began Monday by lifting a nearly 9-inch-thick, three-ring binder and plopping it in front of Mark Borofsky, a retired U.S. Postal Service inspector.\n\nBrennan also placed several stapled stacks of paper, each hardly reaching an inch in thickness, in front of the witness.\n\nBorofsky said the binder contained emails Rowland received or wrote between Oct. 1, 2011, and April 30, 2012, detailing the ex-governor's work on Wilson-Foley's 2012 campaign.\n\nThe emails numbered 787, said Borofsky, now working as an investigative analyst for the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nThe smaller stacks detailed 63 emails between Rowland and Apple Rehab and 20 emails involving Rowland's contract as a consultant for the company.\n\nBrennan then turned to phone calls made and received by Rowland in that time period.\n\nBorofsky said Rowland was involved in 65 calls with Chris Healy, a former state Republican chairman working as a consultant for Wilson-Foley's campaign; 45 with Chris Syrek, Wilson-Foley's campaign manager; and eight with Wilson-Foley -- compared to just nine with Bedard.\n\nThe prosecution is banking on those numbers, along with other evidence, to convince the jury of Rowland's guilt.\n\nObjections by both sides, and a 'show'\n\nBedard will continue testifying Tuesday under Weingarten's questioning, in front of the jury and U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton. The defense's second witness is expected to be Mark Hambley, Apple's former chief financial officer, who is also expected to testify that Rowland did legitimate work for the company.\n\nBefore Bedard took the witness stand, the prosecution urged Arterton to re-advise him of his constitutional rights and warn him about the penalties for perjury. That request brought an objection from Weingarten and from Hugh Keefe, Bedard's lawyer, who was seated in the audience.\n\n\"I resent the government asking the court to advise Mr. Bedard of his rights,\" Keefe said. \"They are trying to intimidate and threaten this man.\"\n\nKeefe also objected to a prosecution reference to Bedard as \"an unindicted co-conspirator\" in this case.\n\nKeefe's soliloquy brought Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Mattei to his feet, objecting to \"the show Mr. Keefe is putting on.\"\n\nArterton cut the debate short, declining to further advise Bedard on his rights.\n\nInstead, the judge chose to advise Rowland he had the right to testify -- or not to testify -- in this case.\n\nShould Rowland testify, the judge told him, \"the pitfalls are many. You open yourself to cross-examination in many areas, not the least of which is your 2004 conviction.\"\n\nRowland said he understood. His lawyers have not disclosed whether the former governor will testify this week.", "Microsoft is pushing very hard to make Windows Phone the third most widely used mobile platform behind Android and iOS. In some markets it has already been able to overtake BlackBerry in order to clinch the coveted third position. The company's aim can only be fulfilled if OEMs are actually making and selling devices powered by Windows Phone. One of China's biggest OEMs has decided to give up all plans of making Windows Phone devices for now.\n\nShao Yang, Huawei's consumer business group marketing director told reporters at the company's HQ in Shenzhen, China that while Huawei has developed Windows Phone smartphones in the past it will not be making anymore and instead will focus on Android to counter Apple and Samsung's dominance in the market.\n\n\"For us we think Android is the best choice,\" Yang said, adding that \"the biggest problem is that Windows is not quite easy to develop independently.\"\n\nThis shift in direction comes a few months after Huawei confirmed back in March that it will developing a new smartphone that would dual-boot Android and Windows Phone. Plans for that device have been cancelled.\n\nHuawei isn't just giving up on Windows Phone, the company has also confirmed that it won't be taking a chance on Tizen just yet. Samsung is one of the biggest backers of this nascent operating system.", "Rock band U2 performed at Apple's September 9th event and also announced that its new album, Songs of Innocence, will be exclusively launched through iTunes. All of Apple's 500 million plus iTunes users have received a copy of this album for free even though Apple is believed to have paid over $100 million for this privilege. The company added this album to users' iTunes libraries without seeking consent which led to many users complaining about this, which is why today Apple has put up a new tool which lets you delete the new U2 album from your library.\n\nMany people tend to be excited whenever they receive free stuff but those who hadn't followed up with the announcements made at Apple's September 9th event were shocked to find a new album in their iTunes libraries.\n\nSome of them took to Twitter to vent and complain about this and it looks like there was ample response from iTunes users which is why Apple has decided to come up with a tool that lets them remove this album.\n\nBefore the album can be removed Apple does point out that once this is done users will not be able to redownload it as a previous purchase if they have a change of heart. They'll need to get it again and while Songs of Innocence is available for free via iTunes until October 13th, iTunes users will have to spend money to purchase the album after the aforementioned date.", "Verizon subscribers who are eligible for an upgrade in the near future have something to get excited about today. The carrier has announced that it is offering an opportunity to these customers to avail a smartphone upgrade two months prior to the date on which they would have actually become eligible.\n\nWhat this means is that subscribers who were going to be eligible for a smartphone upgrade on Verizon on or before November 15th, 2014 will now be able to upgrade their smartphones on Big Red immediately.\n\nThose who are able to take advantage of this new promotion have the opportunity to upgrade to any device that's currently in Verizon's lineup, while having to commit to a new two-year contract with the carrier. Verizon subscribers can check their upgrade eligibility through My Verizon.\n\nThe timing of this promotion doesn't look like a coincidence. Apple's new iPhones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, are both part of Verizon's lineup and have already seen amazing response from customers. Verizon would want its subscribers to jump up to the latest iPhones months before they would have been eligible to do so as that will help it sell more new iPhones as opposed to its rivals.\n\nSo far AT&T and Sprint have not confirmed if they too will be offering a similar early upgrade promotion to subscribers around the time the new iPhones hit the market.", "Apple's new smartphones, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, have already been unveiled and now customers are waiting to get their hands on the units. The company announced today that it saw record pre-orders for both new devices and its announcement has compelled Wall Street analysts to bump up their expectations for sales of the new iPhones this holiday quarter. Some now believe that Apple may end up moving as many as 60 million iPhones in the December quarter.\n\nPiper Jaffray's Gene Munster expects that Apple will be able to move as many as 59 million iPhones in the holiday quarter, which will be the first full quarter after the iPhone 6's launch.\n\nRob Cihra from Evercore Partners is bullish on Apple's December quarter and estimates unit movement for that particular quarter to top 62 million.\n\nEven when the new iPhones were being rumored a couple of months back many analysts predicted that the expected increase in display size is going to drive sales for the iPhones particularly during the holiday period. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays respectively, the largest that Apple has ever put on its smartphones.\n\nApple is also expected to achieve a new sales record once the iPhone 6 release weekend is done and dusted, last year it sold over nine million units of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c combined in the first three days after release.", "The wait for Apple's new iPhone is finally over, and it seems like they prepared to battle a few startups in the industry for users. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but their latest announcement showed that the iPhone 6 has new capabilities previously offered by third-party apps. From the looks of it, the new iPhone comes with many improvements for user experience. That also means Apple is looking to deepen the service value of the smartphone, something Samsung has been trying to do. Samsung, however, has also added more devices (the Gear and Gear Fit in particular). Apple seems to be rallying the market back towards the iPhone.\n\nBut what does that mean for startups that have launched applications and devices with functions similar to iPhone 6's new capabilities? Will these startups be killed by Apple?\n\nCamera Capabilities\n\nApple announced it will maintain the 8 megapixel resolution of the 5S but it will use a new sensor with even larger pixels than before. It will also use digital image stabilization and dual-LED flash. Apps like Camera Awesome and SmugMug are examples of third-party apps that have focused on stabilization and better quality photos.\n\nApple Pay Mobile Payment\n\nApple announced that they will offer mobile payment service. They integrated an NFC chip in the top of the device to offer payments at supported credit card terminals. Purchases are authenticated through the iPhone 6's TouchID sensor to store sensitive credit card data. Although this won't be available until next month, companies like Paypal, Square and LevelUp will have a giant join the competition in the mobile payment arena.\n\nA New HealthKit\n\nApple's HealthKit's software enables other health and fitness apps to share and integrate their data in one platform. The app is also integrated into the new Apple Watch and could potentially monitor everything from the user's heart rate to his or her chronic conditions. Third-party apps like Fitbit, Nike+ and Withings Scale are the major products in this vertical at the moment. Although Apple will allow these apps at first, will they knock the others off the health-app stage as they move into this market?", "Was it just me or did the hype train feel a bit derailed this year when Apple announced the launch of their iPhone 6? Maybe it's the fact that every iPhone looks nearly the exact same as its predecessor, but my gut instinct tells me it goes a bit deeper than that. I think that more people are finally seeing through the surface-aesthetic Apple presents.\n\nIt's 2014, soon to be 2015, and the iPhone 6 is boasting specs that Android users have known and loved for years. Third party keyboards? Widgets? It's wonderful that Apple has finally loosened up on their shackled OS, but Android users just laughed - hell, we're still laughing.\n\nMoreover, I'm prepared to show you why getting an iPhone 6 will not only break your bank, but will haunt you as a terrible decision:\n\nAesthetics\n\nAt a base level, the iPhone 6 weighs less than the top Android phones of 2014 - the HTC One M8, the LG G3, the Samsung Galaxy S5, and the Sony Xperia Z3. The iPhone 6 is also thinner than all of these phones, but let's be real: who is buying a smartphone based around these two categories? Sure it may have an effect, but it's far from a deciding factor.\n\nIt's also important to realize the diversity of aesthetic that Android offers their users. Do you want a full metal body? How about a full plastic body? Gorilla Glass? Perhaps a Kevlar back-plate? At the end of the day the iPhone 6 comes up short, albeit thinner and lighter.\n\nPrice\n\nThis one is simple: the iPhone 6 will set you back $679 retail. That's more expensive than all of the top 2014 Android phones.\n\nHTC One M8: $650\n\nLG G3: $599\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5: $559\n\nSony Xperia Z3: ~$550 (based on Amazon prices)\n\nScreen Size\n\nRegardless of which iPhone 6 model you buy, the normal or the Plus model, you're still going to be outgunned by Android phones. The iPhone 6 regular has a 4.7 inch screen, and the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5 inch screen.\n\nThe HTC One M8 sports a 5 inch screen, the LG G3 a 5.5 inch screen, the Galaxy S5 a 5.1 inch screen, and the Xperia Z3 a 5.2 inch screen. Of course, you could just blow everything out of the water with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, 3, or 4 which sports a 5.7 inch screen; that puts the iPhone 6 to shame by an entire inch and tops even the 5.5 inch iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe important thing to remember, with regard to screen size, is that Android phones run the gamut from smaller than the iPhone 6 all the way bigger than the iPhone 6 Plus. You can pick any size that fits your pocket and lifestyle best while Apple devotees remain locked into one size forever - or until Apple releases the iPhone 7.\n\nCPU\n\nWhen it comes to processing power, it's always good to remember one cardinal rule: a higher iteration does not a good processor make. That is, the Apple A8 processor found in the new iPhone 6 doesn't guarantee it performs better than the A7 simply because it is newer.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that nobody really knows how well the Apple A8 processor will hold up to long, hard usage. The best I've been able to find about it is the following: \"We don't know too much about it yet\".\n\nThe top 2014 Android phones are using the heralded Qualcomm Snapdragon, quad core processor. Not only is this thing a complete work horse, it's been tried, tested, and reviewed by countless fans and has stood up to the test.\n\nNew OS Features\n\nAnd when it comes down to the final straw, the OS, the new iPhone 6 is simply laughable. I could walk you through the finer points of why Android wins here, but Ars Technica writer Ron Amadeo put it better than I ever could with this image - make sure to read the comments people have left:\n\nI couldn't help myself, sorry. pic.twitter.com/NrwbqHMVL4\n\n-- Ron Amadeo (@RonAmadeo) September 9, 2014\n\nAt some point you have to stop buying into the Apple hype and start asking important questions. Why is Apple only now building in features Android users have enjoyed for years? In a world where my smartphone can have a higher resolution than Blu-Ray, why is Apple's iPhone 6 operating at 750p resolution?\n\nWhen the first model of the iPhone was released they may have been better than Android; I'll admit that. But as the battle has raged on, Android has diversified, stepped up their design, and outplayed Apple on nearly all levels. Why keep feeding the beast? And make sure to give me credit when you toss your old iPhone for an Android option.", "Apple last week unveiled two new models of iPhone: the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. The base iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display, while the iPhone 6 Plus features a whopping 5.5-inch display.\n\nThe displays aren't just bigger, but better. Both are termed Retina HD, with the \"smaller\" iPhone displaying at 1334-by-750 resolution and the iPhone Plus displaying at 1920-by-1080. Both support the full sRGB color standard and feature higher contrast, more brightness, and better white balance. Apple promises deeper blacks and sharper text, with wider-angle viewing, and an improved polarizer for better performance outdoors. Despite rumors suggesting sapphire screens, the screen in both iPhone 6 models is still glass.\n\nBoth models of iPhone 6 are thinner than ever. While the iPhone 5s is 7.6 mm thick and the iPhone 5c is 8.97 mm thick, the iPhone 6 is 6.9 mm thick and even the iPhone 6 Plus is only 7.1 mm thick. The larger screens do make a difference in weight, where the iPhone 5s and 5c weigh in at 112 grams and 132 grams, respectively, but the iPhone 6 is 129 grams and the iPhone 6 Plus is a lot heavier, at 172 grams.\n\nOur own Jeff Carlson, who was present at the event, pocketed both models (with the permission of the patient Apple demo staff) -- and found that they fit into regular jeans pockets, with the iPhone 6 Plus obviously occupying more room. Ars Technica has posted a PDF template of the iPhone 6 Plus that you can print and cut out to see how it feels in your hand; perhaps tape it to some cardboard to get a sense of its pocketability. When Adam did that, he found that while the iPhone 6 Plus fit in his jeans pockets, it dug in uncomfortably when he sat down. Your mileage (and clothing) may vary.\n\nAnother tweak that will be almost shocking to long-time iPhone users is that the Sleep-Wake button, which has always been at the top of the device, has moved to the right edge, above the SIM slot. Apple's reason is to better facilitate one-handed use of the larger cases. The Touch ID fingerprint-sensing Home Button is standard.\n\nBehind the screen is Apple's second-generation 64-bit mobile processor, the A8, which features over 2 billion transistors, making it 25 percent faster than the previous A7, and with 50 percent better graphics performance. Apple also claims that the new A8 is 50 percent more energy efficient. That accounts for the battery life, which equals or outperforms the iPhone 5s for all activity modes. One bonus of the iPhone 6 Plus is even better battery life than on the base iPhone 6. For example, while the iPhone 6 boasts up to 10 hours of LTE browsing, the iPhone 6 Plus lasts up to 12 hours. And while the iPhone 6 claims up to 50 hours of audio playback, the iPhone 6 Plus provides up to 80 hours.\n\nAlongside the A8 is Apple's next-generation motion coprocessor, the M8, which features a barometer to sense air pressure to determine elevation (it might also be useful for weather apps). It can also estimate distances with improved sensors.\n\nAlso welcome are major improvements to the cameras. The iPhone 6's 8 megapixel iSight camera has an f/2.2 aperture, along with a host of new features. Focus Pixels is a new technology that replicates the autofocus capabilities of high-end DSLRs for faster focusing. The camera also has faster and more accurate face detection, auto image stabilization to compensate for motion blur and shakiness, and higher-resolution panoramas of up to 43 megapixels. A unique feature of the iPhone 6 Plus camera is optical image stabilization, which moves the sensor to prevent motion blur in low-light situations.\n\nVideos can be captured at up to 60 frames per second in 1080p resolution, and slow-motion video can be captured at 240 fps in 720p resolution (as well as at 120 fps, which was introduced in the iPhone 5s). Video capture now features continuous autofocus to stay sharp on the subject, and cinematic video stabilization to keep video steady.\n\nBut at heart, the iPhone is still a phone, and the iPhone 6 features more connectivity options than ever. It supports up to 20 LTE bands, the most of any smartphone on the market, and can download data at up to 150 Mbps over LTE. Apple will also offer voice over LTE (VoLTE) where available, which should offer increased voice clarity. It also features 802.11ac to take advantage of Apple's latest AirPort routers, with up to three times more throughput than the 802.11n standard used in the iPhone 5s.\n\nA curious feature of the iPhone 6 Plus is Reachability, which enables one-handed operation (and is similar to a Samsung feature that many Apple pundits mocked). Double-touch the Home button and the screen shifts down, making it more accessible to your thumb. The iPhone 6 Plus also features a special landscape view, which works similarly to landscape view functions on the iPad. For example, in Messages, landscape mode displays your list of conversations on the left and your messages on the right, and the home screen rotates to account for the orientation. The iPhone 6, even with a larger screen than the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, does not gain the orientation additions.\n\nOne software display feature both iPhone models will enjoy is Display Zoom, which will increase the size of content to take advantage of the larger screen sizes. Instead of zooming the entire screen, as the existing accessibility feature does, Display Zoom increases the size of icons and buttons, and also provides larger target areas for tapping. That will be particularly welcome to those of us with aging eyes.\n\nSpeaking of display size, apps will have to be tweaked to take full advantage of the larger screen sizes of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. As with iPhone-only apps on the iPad, apps that aren't adjusted for the larger screens will automatically be scaled up via what Apple called \"desktop-class scaling.\"\n\nFinally, both iPhone 6 models will feature near-field communication (NFC) for the first time, which is a cornerstone of Apple's new Apple Pay system. For more on that, and how it relies on the Touch ID sensor built into both iPhone 6 models, see \"Apple Pay Aims to Disrupt Payment Industry,\" 9 September 2014.\n\nBoth models of the iPhone 6 became available for pre-order on 12 September 2014, and will ship on 19 September 2014. They come in the same colors as the iPhone 5s: gold, silver, and space gray. 16 GB of storage is still standard in the $199 base model of the iPhone 6 for those on a budget. For people who need more space, the 32 GB tier has been eliminated, but the price of the 64 GB model has dropped to $299, and there is at long last a 128 GB model for $399. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $100 more for each tier, starting at $299 for the 16 GB model.\n\n9to5Mac is reporting that the 64 GB and 128 GB models will come with iMovie, GarageBand, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and iTunes U pre-installed; they're available as free downloads for the 16 GB models. We hope they can be deleted, for those who don't use them and want to recover the space.\n\nApple is offering a new set of cases in silicone and leather. The silicone cases will retail for $35 for the regular iPhone 6 and $39 for the iPhone 6 Plus and will come in black, blue, pink, green, white, and red (benefitting the Product(RED) charity). The leather cases will cost $45 and $49 and come in black, soft pink, olive brown, midnight blue, and red (again benefitting Product(RED)).\n\nIf you're not interested in the new iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, you may appreciate lower pricing for the current models, which remain available. When you purchase with a two-year service contract, the iPhone 5s drops to $99 for 16 GB and $149 for 32 GB, and the iPhone 5c is available for free.\n\nAlthough we won't know for sure until we spend some quality time with the iPhone 6, it appears that Apple has once again released a worthwhile update. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus aren't revolutionary -- that's not Apple's goal -- but they offer enough new features to attract those who are in the market for a new iPhone, along with those for whom a larger screen is a must. People who are actively turned off by the larger size of these models can stick with the iPhone 5s and 5c for now; it remains to be seen if Apple will maintain a smaller model in future releases.", "To help us avoid automated attempts to spam recipients, please enter the words below.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook reached back in time following his introduction of the iPhone 6 and Apple Pay at the Flint Center last week with a traditional but long absent \"There's one more thing.\" That \"thing,\" of course, was Apple's long-awaited smartwatch, which Apple showed on slides using the \"\uf8ffWATCH\" logomark, though, luckily, the company uses the more text-friendly \"Apple Watch\" name on its Web site.\n\nHowever, you'll have to reach forward in time to get one: the Apple Watch won't be available until early in 2015. And it's not a single device, but a whole range of them, spread among three separate lines:\n\nEach line consists of a number of different models, in two sizes -- 38 mm and 42 mm -- and with a variety of available bands, from durable colored plastic with a magnetic fastener, through various traditional buckle models, to Milanese loops. Between the various Apple Watch lines, there are dozens of different configurations being offered. Apple has never, in my recollection, offered so many varieties of a single product at launch. And, compared to other smartwatches currently on the market in terms of design, Apple's latest offerings are, well, there isn't any comparison: these are the first smartwatches I've seen that look absolutely like wristwatches.\n\nThe Apple Watch, like many watches, is water-resistant but not waterproof. That is, you will be able to wear it in the rain or wash your hands with it on, but not wear it in the shower or swim with it. Athletes may be uncomfortable with that level of protection; there isn't much difference between a downpour and a shower.\n\nBut that's all on the surface. What does the Apple Watch actually do, and how does it do it?\n\nAs a watch, it offers over two million different ways to tell time, according to Apple. The Apple Watch will have a wide variety of software watch faces, many of them customizable with what watchmakers call \"complications.\" Apple Watch complications include stopwatches and stock reports, along with phases of the moon and upcoming meetings. The screen, of course, is touch-sensitive, but not just multi-touch. The Apple Watch screen also offers force sensitivity, so it can distinguish between a tap and hard press, which Apple calls a \"force touch.\"\n\nMethods for controlling the interface itself are almost a blend of the old-fashioned click-wheel on the original iPod and the touch-screen of the iPhone. Aside from the screen, the watch stem, known as the \"digital crown,\" is a primary means of control. Users click and twirl the crown to control many onscreen actions. A second button below the crown can be pressed to switch to a list of contacts who can be reached using the Apple Watch's connection to the user's iPhone.\n\nThat's right: many of the Apple Watch's features work in collaboration with a nearby iPhone, and in fact, an iPhone is required. Happily, any model from an iPhone 5 on up will do. In conjunction with the iPhone the Apple Watch can message contacts, play music, serve as a real-life Dick Tracy wrist-radio using its built-in speaker and microphone, handle mail, and more. Among that \"more\" is Siri, allowing for dictation as well as information retrieval, and various new personal messaging capabilities, including the ability to exchange sketches, animated emoji, and tap sequences (the Apple Watch includes haptic feedback, meaning you can feel those taps on your wrist). The watch can also share your heartbeat in real time.\n\nThat last is courtesy of the various sensors built-in to the Apple Watch. These can measure heart rate, body movement (including when you stand and sit), and, in conjunction with an iPhone's GPS, keep track of how far you've gone on your morning run or bike ride. All this information and more is handled via the watch's Activity app and its Workout app, not to mention the apps that communicate with HealthKit, a new iOS 8 feature, on the iPhone. Although Apple claims to have designed the Apple Watch for everyone from couch potatoes to serious athletes, Adam tells me that many serious runners would be unlikely to want to carry an entire iPhone as well as wear a watch, and as a lifelong competitive runner, he should know.\n\nAlso in conjunction with the iPhone, the Apple Watch can serve as a point-of-purchase device, using an NFC transceiver to make payments via a merchant's reader. This is all enabled courtesy of the new Apple Pay service that was announced at the same event (see \"Apple Pay Aims to Disrupt Payment Industry,\" 9 September 2014).\n\nAlthough most of what Apple demoed the Apple Watch doing involved Apple apps, there will be a WatchKit API that independent developers can use to create their own apps. They'll presumably need to communicate with a host app on the iPhone, but Apple provided no details on that today.\n\nGiven all the things that the Apple Watch does, and its small size, one inevitably wonders what kind of battery life it offers. Apple isn't saying anything beyond \"an active day's use\" right now. The Apple Watch uses a magnetic induction device that snaps to the back of the watch and recharges it overnight -- how long a charging cycle takes is another question that Apple has yet to answer. We anticipate that it will be the sort of thing you'll need to plug in before bed every night.\n\nThose in the \"shut up and take my money\" crowd (I may find myself marching with them) will need to save up at least $349 for the cheapest Apple Watch. How much the highest end watch, or, indeed, any other than the cheapest watch, will cost is another of those pesky unanswered questions at this time.\n\nLast year, Josh Centers speculated on what kind of watch Apple would deliver (see \"Making the Case for an iWatch,\" 3 July 2013). It looks like he scored rather well. Among the items floating in his \"claim chowder\" offering were:\n\nPretty tasty chowder, Josh!\n\nBut will Apple Watch sales be tasty for Apple? Even at $349, I expect Apple to sell carloads of these timepieces from the future. What's more, given that what was shown today was a preview of a 1.0 product, I expect the product lines to evolve quickly, and the price range to expand both lower and higher.\n\nI believe we'll see a lot of \"IOU an Apple Watch\" cards being left under the tree this holiday season.", "Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle. Although the Lego-like multiplayer game is currently the top paid app for the iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., today's popular hit could be tomorrow's dud. The maker of the much obsessed-over \"Candy Crush Saga,\" for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.\n\nIn addition, the founders of Mojang, the Swedish company behind \"Minecraft,\" aren't staying with Microsoft. That could raise questions about Mojang's ability to create another big hit.\n\nThen again, a big hit was not what co-founder Markus \"Notch\" Persson was after when he created the game, according to a blog post Monday from Mojang and a note from Persson himself on his website.\n\n\"It certainly seems like the founders of 'Minecraft' didn't want to continue forward,\" Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. \"It was something too big for them. 'Minecraft' is best in the hands of somebody who can take it in the direction it needs to go for the user.\"\n\nMicrosoft has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses -- Windows and Office software installed on desktops -- slow down or decline. With \"Minecraft,\" Blau said, Microsoft gains a new type of customer -- mobile players.\n\n\"'Minecraft' is very popular on mobile,\" Blau said. \"It has an audience that wouldn't necessarily think of Microsoft first. The mobile audience is typically Apple and Samsung.\"\n\n\"Minecraft\" is an \"open world\" game in gamer lingo, meaning it has no plot or outlined objectives. Players can explore and create virtual worlds built from blocky 3-D objects -- thus the frequent Lego comparisons.\n\n\"It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea,\" Minecraft's website explains.\n\nBesides iPhones and Android devices, the game is available on Windows, Macs, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft said it will continue to make \"Minecraft\" available on all those platforms after the deal closes, expected this year.\n\nWith an all-ages \"E'' rating, the game has been downloaded 100 million times on personal computers since its debut in 2009, and it's the most popular online game on Microsoft's Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft, which released the first Xbox in 2001, also owns the blockbuster \"Halo\" video game franchise. Unlike \"Halo,\" though, \"Minecraft\" is especially popular with younger gamers whose parents might not be comfortable with them going on wild alien shootouts.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in trying to reach that audience. Activision Blizzard Inc., the maker of the \"Call of Duty\" shooter series, also makes \"Skylanders,\" a kids' video game that's played using toy figures.\n\nNow, it will be Microsoft's job to keep Minecraft's loyal fan base happy. It's something raised any time big, established corporations buy little, much-loved independent companies. It happened when Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and more recently when Amazon.com Inc. agreed to buy Twitch, the online network that lets people watch live and recorded footage of others playing video games.\n\n\"Change is scary, and this is a big change for all of us. It's going to be good though. Everything is going to be OK,\" Owen Hill, Mojang's \"chief word officer,\" wrote in a blog post Monday.\n\n\"Minecraft will continue to evolve, just like it has since the start of development. We don't know specific plans for Minecraft's future yet, but we do know that everyone involved wants the community to grow and become even more amazing than it's ever been,\" he continued.\n\nThe acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division. Besides \"Halo,\" it includes the \"Forza\" racing game. In a statement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that with \"Minecraft,\" Microsoft is getting \"an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft.\"\n\nBlau said it helps that Microsoft knows games.\n\n\"It's got the Xbox,\" he said. \"So overall ... it's a good move and a good fit because they have experience in the game industry.\"", "U2'S INVASION of iTunes libraries with the group's new album, \"Songs of Innocence,\" may not have put the Irish band back on top of the sales chart, but that doesn't mean the impact of last week's stunt can't be seen.\n\nIn the wake of the free - and uninvited - distribution of the album to 500 million iTunes shoppers and iPhone users on Tuesday, music fans have been hungrily revisiting the group's catalog, and as of yesterday, 11 of its albums were back in iTunes' top-albums rankings.\n\nAnd that's almost a week later.

Previously, positive economic data had also encouraged investment. Now, signs of weakness in China were causing a downturn in prices.\n\nSome analysts said another reason for the fall of nearly all the Chinese stocks and ETFs could be anticipation of Alibaba's IPO as traders made room in their portfolio for the new stock, although Oey did not think the listing of one firm would significantly affect overall market performance.\n\nSaturday's reports, combined with other recent indicators, signaled a dramatic slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

Deliveries of pre-orders will begin Friday and continue through October.\n\nBumper first-day pre-orders point to first-weekend sales of up to 10 million units, analysts estimated.\n\nAbout 2 million pre-orders were received for the iPhone 5 in the first 24 hours after it went on sale in September 2012. Apple sold 5 million of the phones in the first weekend.\n\nApple sold 9 million iPhone 5Ss and 5Cs, which were launched last year, in the first three days in stores. The company did not reveal pre-order numbers for those phones.\n\nThe company routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone redesign.\n\nApple's Web site showed last week that the larger 5.5-inch \"Plus\" models had a wait time of up to a month. The 4.7-inch version was available for delivery Sept. 19.\n\nThe company said the new iPhone models will be available to customers in its stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and some other countries Friday morning.\n\nAT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile US, Verizon Wireless and some Apple-authorized resellers will also start selling the phones Friday.\n\nIncome inequality is taking a toll on state governments.\n\nThe widening gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else has been matched by a slowdown in state tax revenue growth, according to a report Monday by Standard & Poor's.\n\nEven as income for the affluent has accelerated, it's barely kept pace with inflation for most other people. That trend can mean a double-whammy for states: The wealthy often manage to shield much of their income from taxes, and they tend to spend less of it than others do, thereby limiting sales tax revenue.\n\nAs the growth of tax revenue has slowed, states have faced tensions over whether to raise taxes or cut spending to balance their budgets as required by law.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, government data show that median household income rose by a few thousand dollars since 1979 to $51,017 in 2012 and remains below its level before the recession began in late 2007. By contrast, the top 1 percent has thrived. Their incomes averaged $1.26 million in 2012, up from $466,302 in 1979, according IRS data.\n\nBefore income inequality began to rise consistently, state tax revenue grew an average of 9.97 percent a year from 1950 to 1979. That average steadily fell with each subsequent decade, dipping to 3.62 percent between 2000 and 2009.\n\nState tax revenue growth has risen slightly since then as the economy has recovered and some states -- California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, for example -- have adopted higher top marginal income tax rates, according to S&P.\n\n\u25cf United Airlines is offering its flight attendants buyouts of as much as $100,000 as it seeks to rein in costs.

The Chicago-based company also is recalling 1,450 furloughed attendants, most of whom took voluntary leave one or two years ago, spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said.\n\n\u25cf Microsoft said it's buying Mojang, maker of the popular \"Minecraft\" video game, for $2.5 billion.

Starboard took Olive Garden and its management to task for such issues as its liberal distribution of breadsticks, its failure to salt the water used to boil its pasta and even the length of the asparagus it serves.\n\n\u25cf The bankrupt Revel casino hotel in Atlantic City will go to auction Sept. 24, a judge ruled. Judge Gloria Burns in Camden, N.J., also set Sept. 23 as the deadline for competing bids to top the $90 million offered by Florida developer Glenn Straub and his Polo North Country Club. Revel cost $2.4 billion to construct. Revel also got approval to pay Straub a $3 million break-up fee if his is not the winning bid at the auction. The auction was set for two weeks after Straub's proposal was made public, and creditors complained that potential buyers could use more time to put together competing bids\n\n\u25cf Massachusetts' highest court threw out a lawsuit seeking to block Tesla Motors from selling its luxury electric cars directly to consumers in the state, enabling it to bypass traditional dealerships.

Additionally, Apple beefed up its executive page to spotlight more diversity by featuring executives who report to Tim Cook, including two women: Lisa Jackson and Denise Young-Smith.\n\nIt's not entirely surprising, however. Considering tech conferences are mostly male, the speakers tend to reflect the audience. But Apple's products are made for both demographics -- the company even introduced a smaller version of its smartwatch that will likely appeal to those of us women with smaller wrists.\n\nIt's a simple fix for Apple to make -- Angela Ahrendts, fashion icon and head of retail for Apple, would've been in the perfect position to help introduce the Apple Watch, especially since CEO Tim Cook stressed how much thought went into the design to make it not only technically functional, but stylish as well.\n\nWhen women were missing from the WWDC keynote stage, we called them out for it.

Well, turns out, the move wasn't so cool because Apple distributed the album automatically -- without the user's consent -- to every iTunes user's iCloud account whether or not they wanted it. Just a few weeks ago, iCloud was under fire for privacy concerns, and forcing a U2 album on 500 million users isn't really helping their case.

It is the most popular online game on Xbox, and the top paid app for Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating system in the U.S.\n\nMicrosoft said it will to continue to make \"Minecraft\" available across all the platforms on which it is available today: PC, iOS, Android, Xbox and PlayStation.\n\n\"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise it is an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nMicrosoft expects the acquisition to be break-even in fiscal 2015.\n\nIn a blog post, Mojang said its founders, Markus Persson, known as \"Notch\"; Carl Manneh; and Jakob Pors\u00e9r are leaving the company.\n\nMicrosoft is primarily known for the Windows operating system and business software like its Microsoft Office suite. But this acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division, which also includes game franchises such as the \"Halo\" shooter game and \"Forza\" racing game.\n\nMicrosoft bought Nokia's phone business for $7.3 billion in April and is also seeking to boost Microsoft's Windows Phone system, which has gained little traction against Apple's iPhones and Google's Android system. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses -- Windows and Office software installed on desktops -- slow down or decline.\n\n\"We believe the acquisition of the ubiquitous Minecraft game (almost 54 million copies sold) strategically makes sense as Microsoft looks for ways to drive users toward its nascent mobile hardware business, where it can leverage and cross-sell a wide range of its higher-margin software (e.g., Office 365, Windows),\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.\n\nShares fell 26 cents to $46.44 in morning trading.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1tYrVNL", "Since U2 stunned the music world by delivering a surprise album at Apple's iPhone 6 unveiling and making it available to a half-billion iTunes users for free, they've gotten an avalanche of publicity.\n\nBut who's listening to it? The picture started to become more clear when Apple said Monday that 33 million users downloaded or streamed \"Songs of Innocence\" in the first six days of its release. Apple says that's a record, but for U2's manager, Guy Oseary, the numbers weren't really the point: The album will live on in users' iCloud, and the band envisions new listeners accessing it for the first time for years to come.\n\n\"We're quite happy that 7 percent of the planet has this album, and they can enjoy it at their leisure,\" Oseary said.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Famers' move was hotly debated within the industry as people tried to assess whether it was another stroke of genius from a band that has been a top-selling juggernaut for decades or a ploy by an aging group trying to make a splash in a landscape that has vastly changed since it released its last album in 2009. Even though that album went platinum, its sales were a bit of a disappointment for the band.\n\nBack then, frontman Bono told The Associated Press, \"We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we (tried to) create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging for people who have grown up on a diet of pop stars.\"\n\nThat diet has gotten even more extreme since then, with album sales continuing to plummet industrywide, singles dominating and streaming services including Spotify and even iTunes helping to diminish the impact of a cohesive art form album.\n\nSo what is U2 trying to achieve with its latest Apple alliance? Oseary said the band achieved one goal: keeping the integrity of \"Songs\" intact by releasing it as an album. As far as U2's larger business goals?\n\n\"I don't expect everyone to get everything now,\" Oseary said. \"Maybe in a few years things will start making sense or they won't. But that's not our job. Our job is to make sure the music is in as many hands as possible. This was an incredible opportunity to do that.\"\n\nU2 joined Jay Z, Beyonce and a growing number of artists who are working out exclusive corporate deals and employing guerrilla ad campaigns rather than moving the album through the typical marketing plan of singles release and slow build to launch date.\n\nLike Jay Z and his Samsung partnership to launch \"Magna Carta ... Holy Grail\" last year, U2 and Interscope Records get handsomely paid -- something that's no longer guaranteed from album sales alone -- and the money comes on up front. Apple continues a high-profile relationship with a longtime business and philanthropic partner, plus earns more credit for innovation. Fans get something for free and those who don't want it can just ignore it.\n\n\"I applaud each of those artists creating a stir and not just falling into a predictable marketing strategy,\" longtime producer and Sony Music Entertainment executive Clive Davis said. \"I think in the case of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z, they had successful results triggering so much extra media attention and coverage because they didn't do things in a formulaic kind of manner.\"\n\nBut there may be penalties to pay later if physical retailers refuse to stock the album, as Target did when Beyonce surprise-dropped her self-titled LP exclusively on iTunes last December for a week (it was still a top-seller worldwide). And there are still lots of questions. Will fans now buy a physical copy, released Oct. 14? Will the band lose some of its cool? Even the unflappable Jay Z suffered backlash when the app he and Samsung used to distribute his album to 1 million customers cataloged user information, and there have already been complaints from some who didn't want a U2 album on their cloud -- even as a gift.\n\nRob Beckham, an agent with William Morris Endeavor Entertainment who handles some of country music's biggest stars, thinks any negatives that might emerge have already been offset. All acts suffer a cooling of interest when their careers reach into the decades, he said, and the trick is to find ways to rekindle interest and build new audiences. A win for U2, for sure, but in some ways he feels the excitement over an innovative move will inspire the industry.\n\n\"People still have to have a passion for the music,\" Beckham said. \"They have to have a passion to buy it, the passion to steal it or the passion to copy it. To me, the best part of this is they're getting new music into the marketplace. I think the hardest part is going to be at some point if record labels are not able to sell music and make money, then you're going to see a lot fewer artists and a lot less music in the marketplace.\"\n\nThere's no question the album's arrival got the meter moving in a year that's been light on buzzy releases. Reports surfaced earlier that the band would not release an album until 2015 after teasing its imminent arrival earlier this year. Now, it will be one of 2014's most memorable musical moments.\n\nOseary declined to release financial details of the deal and said he was not privy to Apple's spending on its advertising campaign. The band is focused on next month's deluxe edition release, which will include four unreleased songs and acoustic versions of album tracks, and he said they're not ready to talk about the forthcoming album \"Songs of Experience\" or speculation that a tour announcement is imminent.\n\nHe encouraged everyone to think differently.\n\n\"I think it's great for music,\" he said. \"Someone right now may have seen this happen and they may decide they want to do something amazing with artwork or with lyrics or something amazing with a video or photos. We don't know what someone else will innovate, but it's great to see something exciting happen and see big companies launch something with new music.\"", "(CNN) -- Apple learned an important lesson this week: Not everyone likes U2. And even those who do really don't like it when you put files on their devices without asking.\n\nA week after giving away a U2 album to most iTunes users, Apple has announced a way for customers to get rid of it.

It was a clever way to get more people to sign up for iTunes, and Apple even produced a special ad to promote the collaboration.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of just offering customers the option to download the album for free, Apple went ahead and gave it to them without asking. The album was dropped into the 500 million active iCloud accounts in 119 countries. The people who have their iCloud account set up to automatically download any purchases to their computers and mobile devices saw the files in their music libraries.\n\nMany complained that the way the album was distributed was invasive.

And operating systems, devices and applications are being developed quickly. Apple's recent announcements for its iPhone 6, iOS8, Apple Watch and Apple Pay are yet more evidence of the fast-paced growth in technological capabilities and the consumption of communication and media.\n\nSo how can mobile technologies and data help us to manage the customer journey, and engage the customer better? I recently wrote about mobile marketing comparing native mobile apps versus HTML 5, but this is so 2013!\n\nHence I feel the urge to write on how new technologies can help us engage our clients better. And no. I am not going to discuss social and / or advertising in this column.\n\nSo what we are really discussing here is geo-fencing, geo-targeting, usage of behavioral mobile analytics, and linking it to a data-driven multi-channel engagement lifecycle campaign. Sounds big, let's break it down.\n\nThe title 'micro moments' suggests that attention spans from mobile consumers are short, and thus have to be characterized by short, actionable, timely communications and with relevant content. This in essence works by - you've guessed it right - triggers that are sensitive to location, to the usage and the situation the customer is in: making it all highly contextual.\n\nGeo-fencing is a technology that allows the marketer to select a geographical point of where the user is, and surround them with a fence. If the user then crosses that boundary, they will receive a triggered notification (think altitude and longitude). We're looking into one-to-one communication with the customer from a segmentation perspective.\n\nGeo-location is the ability to target consumers based on their general location. This is a one-to-many communication from a segmentation perspective. While these technologies have been around for sometime now, marketers and vendors are improving their reach, the ability to collect data (A.K.A stalking!) in big data modules, and aggregate it in sophisticated modules that allow them to serve the customer with much more relevant communication that results in higher ROI.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nPerfectProduct is a 'bricks and clicks' department store (physical shops and e-commerce) that sells online and offline and has branches in different states. Apart from transactional data (purchases), e-mail addresses, mobile phone numbers, and personal information, they also keep track of devices the user is using (via their installed app), their purchase habits per device, and the specific stores they visit (physical shops, and e-commerce).\n\nPerfectProduct is also using a marketing platform that allows them to serve their customer via multichannel lifecycle tools.\n\nThe Story Begins\n\nPerfectProduct has just started to promote its Christmas offerings across its shops and is currently e-mailing vouchers for various products to loyal clients for use online and in-store.\n\nJorge, one of their loyal customers has not used the voucher for four weeks now. By this point, Jorge according to the business's eRFM model, is a churning Gold customer. We also know Jorge has downloaded, and is using the PerfectProduct application.\n\nA Moment With Jorge\n\nWhile Jorge was traveling to the next closest city with his family, all Gold churning customers in the area of the city who have not used the voucher, receive an SMS (geo-targeting) and are told that they are close to a PerfectProduct shop (with a link to Google maps) and that their voucher will expire after the weekend.\n\nMicro Moments In Action\n\nAs Jorge and his family walk into the first level of the shop, Jorge receives specific offers by email for children's clothing, available on this floor, and by the time they have walked up to the second floor specializing in women products, Jorge has decided to open the PerfectProduct app and a push notification alerting him of the newest collections of handbags, including discounts for Gold customers.\n\nTo make sure it is sending the right offers, PerfectProduct supports the data accuracy of its offering with iBeacon. When Jorge entered the store, several strangers also entered the shop in response to the push notification announcing the handbag sale on the second floor. Because the PerfectProduct database contains the unique identifier of Jorge (e-mail address in this case - other identifiers can be considered), instead of being an anonymous visitor, PerfectProduct can treat Jorge in the right context and drive him to the right content based on his historical purchase, and current situation.\n\nCustomers who didn't have the app were sent downloadable vouchers to their Apple Passbook or Google Wallet which could be triggered via location-sensitive communication.\n\nThis journey can continue if Jorge doesn't purchase in the shop, and we can look into retargeting Jorge in case he did not buy anything.\n\nMinority report? Not necessarily. The key to bringing it to reality is to collect data, score clients, and link channels and customer behavior.\n\nUntil next time, stay tuned!", "THE Australian dollar is recovering from its dip below 90 US cents.

Although some customers will receive their devices this Friday, Apple acknowledged that many will have to wait until October for the coveted packages to arrive. In the meantime, the new phones, which feature larger screens, will hit the shelves of local retail stores Friday morning.\n\n\"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are better in every way, and we are thrilled customers love them as much as we do,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. \"Pre-orders for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set a new record for Apple, and we can't wait to get our best iPhones yet into the hands of customers starting this Friday.\"\n\nApple received 2 million pre-orders for the iPhone 5, the last model for which it disclosed statistics on advance sales. The next yardstick for the new iPhones' success will come opening weekend. Apple sold 9 million gadgets last year during the first weekend of sales for the iPhone 5S and 5C.\n\nApple unveiled the iPhone 6, which measures 4.7 inches diagonally, and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus last Tuesday at a star-studded event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts in Cupertino, along with a long-awaited smartwatch. An Apple spokeswoman declined to breakdown the early sales figures between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 Plus appeared to sell out first on carriers' websites, but that may be because supplies of the larger device are more limited, said Ken Dulaney, an analyst at research firm Gartner.\n\nAnalysts predicted that consumers would flood stores when Apple finally matched its peers with larger screens. Although the sales records make for good press, consumers are easily frustrated by long waits, Dulaney said.\n\n\"That seems like a little bit of poor planning,\" he said. \"When you announce the device, you want to ship it.\"\n\nConsumers have shown a willingness not only to wait for the new iPhones, but to fork over more money for them. The iPhone 6 costs $199 with a two-year contract, but the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 -- $100 more than the flagship device fetched last year. It's favorable math for the Cupertino-based company, Dulaney noted.", "BBJ web editor Eric Convey talks about the Mass.

Motion control? 1080p at 60 frames per second? They've got nothing on an infinite world full of vaguely 8-bit-looking blocks. With its purchase of Minecraft and the studio behind it, Microsoft isn't just buying a game; it's buying the heart of a generation.\n\nHere's everything Microsoft picked up today in its $2.5 billion Minecraft purchase. It's way more than just pixels.\n\nAsk a kid -- any kid -- about Minecraft, and you're almost sure to make an instant connection. It's the modern-day equivalent of greeting your nephew with a clumsy \"Mario twins\" reference. And adults are just as smitten. The combination of simple mechanics combined with virtually limitless depth makes Minecraft great for after-work play with old college friends and all-day summer vacation binges. There's a reason we all know its name.\n\nThe community of fandom around the game is staggeringly huge and multilayered. It's not just that there are tens of millions of fans of Minecraft itself. There are entire sprawling sub-communities based on the game's hundreds of utterly transformative mods. There are celebrity Minecraft players that post hundreds of hours of videos to YouTube, play together, and rub elbows with fans. Minecraft even has its own convention, one that Microsoft has already confirmed will continue after it absorbs the company that makes the game it honors.\n\nIt's a thriving community of enthusiastic builders and makers, the likes of which Microsoft hasn't seen in ages, if ever. And with Sony dominating the next-gen battlefield in part thanks to a super indie-game friendly outlook that could bring about whatever the next Minecraft might be, Microsoft needs some love of its own.\n\nIf you can't build a passionate fanbase around your products -- and let's face it, Office works just fine but doesn't stir many hearts -- you can always just buy one. And Microsoft just bought millions of the most passionate fans in the world.\n\nAnd of course what makes Minecraft great is that it's so much more than just a game. Even if you've got no love for spelunking through endless digital caverns, riding pigs, or slaying creepers, the simple block-by-block building that Minecraft refined and popularized is suited to all kinds of building. Minecraft isn't just a vehicle for the tech-inclined to build out 1KB hard drives; it's a format for building and experimenting and creating that's already inherently fun. Wiring up a skeleton slayer with redstone logic gates is infinitely more fun -- and arguably far more effective -- than reading through a coding tutorial. And kids are already doing it on their own, they just need a little nudge and some context.\n\nIt's a huge educational opportunity, one that Microsoft would be wise to exploit. Kids get to play Minecraft in school, and Microsoft gets to sponsor their squeals of joy, earning respect and recognition from young 'uns that will never have that sort of attachment to Windows 8 (or 9 or 10) or Microsoft Office.\n\nNot to mention that the classroom is a place where Microsoft desperately needs to catch up. Apple has its (troubled) plan to push iPads to the classroom. Amazon's Kindle Fires have kid-friendly modes built right in. Google's cramming Chromebooks in to computer labs. Microsoft, meanwhile, has its stalled-out Surface RT and little else to offer, short of setting schools up with Xbox Ones. Minecraft is a quick and easy way in, and crucially, it's one that's supported on virtually all of Microsoft's competitor's devices.\n\nAnd that's where the true value of Minecraft lays for Microsoft, the chance to gently attach itself to what's already the most transformative and wildly popular software in recent memory. Sure, the 50 million copies already sold aren't doing any good for Microsoft, but there's still room to grow, whether by (carefully) slicing off a piece of Minecraft's naturally occurring micro-transaction scene, pushing big licensing deals, or just watching the phenomenon that is Minecraft continue to soldier on.\n\nMicrosoft is at its heart a software company. But in a world where Google Docs and free OS X upgrades are closing in from all sides, selling the kind of software Microsoft traditionally has isn't nearly as easy as it used to be. Meanwhile, Minecraft sells like hot cakes on fire. $2.5 billion might sound like a lot to you and me, but as far as Microsoft is concerned it hardly registers. A few billion dollars is a small price to pay to own some of the world's best selling software in its totality. Especially when Minecraft is profitable enough that Microsoft should recoup its investment in just a few years.\n\nOf course the endgame needs to be more than just selling more copies of Minecraft, or Xbox consoles. The Minecraft community does't just love its game; it can be ferociously protective of it. And yes, Microsoft could hypothetically use this purchase as a cudgel and make \"Minecraft 2\" an Xbox One exclusive. But that would be at the cost of destroying the phenomenon that it just paid billions of dollars to purchase, and surely Microsoft knows that. Minecraft on iOS and Android and Playstation and OS X will continue to exist, and probably thrive; Microsoft is in the business of being all-encompassing.\n\nMinecraft isn't Candy Crush or Angry Birds. It's a thriving ecosystem, one inhabited by millions of people, spread across every generation. That's not something you can intentionally set out to build; it's something that happens through a mix of timing and competence and magic. Could Microsoft have built something like that internally? It could certainly have tried. But its success would have been subject to more stars aligning than it can afford. Minecraft, meanwhile, is a shortcut to the exact kind of success Microsoft needs right now.\n\nBy snapping up Minecraft at the peak of its popularity, Microsoft is getting the chance to reintroduce itself to millions upon millions of users in the comfort of the blocky wooden shacks they lovingly call home. And if it can avoid burning them down in the process, well, all the better.", "Apple recently gave away the new U2 album, Songs of Innocence, for free. The promotion was announced last Tuesday, when Apple introduced the iPhone 6 and its new Apple Watch device. Apple says it gave the album to 500 million iTunes customers around the world. Apple says, \"Never before have so many people owned one album, let alone on the day of its release.\" Apple told users that the new U2 album is \"already in your library.\" U2 fans were no doubt overjoyed to have a brand new U2 album appear for no charge in their iTunes library. However, there was a backlash from people who don't care for U2. Re/code", "News about Apple's health and fitness data hub, HealthKit, got a bit lost last week amid splashier announcements on Apple Pay, the new iPhones and the Apple Watch. But Apple's move into the health data space makes the company a potentially powerful force in the growing world of health and fitness data.\n\nThe service isn't an app, per se, though its information will show up in the \"Health\" app on iPhones running iOS 8. HealthKit draws together health and fitness information pulled from other applications together -- the number of steps you've walked according to your pedometer app may show up alongside readings from your glucose meter, or weigh-ins from your smart scale. In all cases, Apple has said, users will be able to opt-in or out of having HealthKit collect that data in its central hub.\n\nThat, understandably, could make some users nervous about the security of that data -- especially in light of the recently leaked photos of celebrities that had been stored on Apple's iCloud.\n\nThe company has moved quickly to address privacy concerns that consumers might have about its new health product. Any information collected from health apps is stored, encrypted, on users' devices. If it does need to be transmitted to iCloud -- in the case of a backup, for example -- Apple will require the information to be encrypted. When it comes to third-party use of data, Apple has already told developers storing health and fitness data that they should not use iCloud, which does not meet the stringent federal requirements to comply with health privacy laws. (That also helps Apple neatly avoid the current debate over how medical data should be protected in the cloud.)\n\nThe company has also said that HealthKit data cannot be shared with data brokers or used for advertising. Developer guidelines for apps that access HealthKit also require that all such applications have a privacy policy, which pulls them under the watchful eye of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThose measures drew some praise from Sen. Chuck Schumer, who has made the protection of health data one of his primary concerns. Schumer has, for example, criticized the fitness tracker Fitbit for not prohibiting the sale of data from its trackers to third parties. Fitbit has since changed its policies.\n\n\"Preventing the sale of personal information and requiring users to opt in to allow any sensitive data sharing are key components to any effective privacy policy, and Apple is doing the right thing by doing both,\" Schumer said in a statement. \" Including provisions like these in privacy policies should be a no-brainer for tech companies.\"\n\nPrivacy experts, however, said that while Apple may be being careful with health data, the very collection of data may sign users up for more than they bargained for. Joseph Turow, a privacy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that users often don't understand how combining sets of benign-seeming data can identify them.\n\n\"I think people have to be wary,\" he said. \"Who you are or how your personality is all can be inferred from little points of data. More activities will be looked at and this will have to be a social discussion we have.\"\n\nThe rise of fitness trackers and smart medical equipment is big business, with sales of at least $330 million as of the start of this year. But consumers often have to open several apps to track their data, because Apple does not allow apps to share information with each other. With HealthKit, Apple has the potential to knock down a lot of barriers within the industry, particularly when it comes to making it easy for users to see data collected by multiple apps in one place.\n\nHigh-profile partnerships with organizations such as the Mayo Clinic and the electronic health record company Epic have made Apple's platform very attractive to developers, whose apps Apple needs to keep consumers coming back to Apple devices. \"When they stepped up on stage with Epic and Mayo, they said to developer community that they will help you with access to these key health providers,\" said Morgan Reed, the executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology, an app developers trade group. \"Those are doors that are rarely opened for us.\"", "When it comes to takeovers there are lies, damned lies and commitments. At least that has been the case up until now.\n\nMost recently this could be seen in what Pfizer claimed were \"binding\" commitments to the UK as part of its tilt at AstraZeneca. Except that they weren't, at least not really, if you read the small print.\n\nBefore that it was Kraft and the Cadbury factory that the US food giant said it would keep in the UK. Only for the work to disappear off to Poland (as Cadbury had planned) with the ink on the deal sealing Kraft's takeover of the chocolate maker barely dry.\n\nUnions, various scientific and medical organisations (in the case of Pfizer), politicians and others have all cried foul at some point in these situations.\n\nSo the Takeover Panel is proposing to extend its responsibilities as the City's referee by drawing a distinction between an intention and a commitment, with only the latter being made binding.\n\nThere's a good reason for this. The Panel wants to leave companies free to talk about intentions, because it wants companies to be free to talk generally.\n\nIn the tug of war of a takeover shareholders and others need to be able to hear from both sides - or even all sides if other parties enter the fray - to formulate a clear view.\n\nSo in future, they can bang on about their intentions with impunity. However, we'll be well aware that lofty talk about \"intentions\" won't amount to a hill of beans.\n\nThose companies pledging commitments, however, may find themselves landed with supervisors to ensure they keep their promises. There will also be less scope for woolly get-out clauses that could (in theory) make commitments worthless. Such as, for example, Pfizer's vague talk about fiduciary duty and material adverse change that could both have caused it to renege on its promises to the UK.\n\nThis takes the panel into new territory. For a start, it could find itself acting as policeman on behalf of organisations such as unions, possibly even pressure groups, and politicians to whom commitments are often made. It may also have its willingness to bare its teeth tested.\n\nThe panel has, up until now, in effect relied upon companies and their advisors playing nice to achieve its aims, despite the fact that this is an increasingly outmoded concept in the City.\n\nIt has always had the power to go to court to get its rulings enforced under the Companies Act, but it's never actually had to do so.\n\nPerhaps that's partly because those involved in the mergers and acquisitions market have a vested interest in keeping the panel in place, given that the alternative would likely see the Financial Conduct Authority taking up the cudgels.\n\nWhat happens now, though, if a company wants to, say, close a factory it had promised to keep open after a deal? That's where things could get interesting.\n\nBecause powers the panel has deployed in the past - such as censure - won't be anything like enough in such a situation.\n\n\"It's not about the money,\" the founder of Minecraft creator Mojang claimed.\n\nMarkus Persson now wants to tinker about with \"small-scale\" web projects.\n\nHis share of the $2.5bn (\u00a31.53bn) purchase price from Microsoft will buy an awful lot of tinkering and relieves him of the pressure of being a chief executive, something he never wanted.\n\nNot so Satya Nadella, the Microsoft boss who now needs Minecraft's developers to come good. The price might be chump change for the software giant, but it's still a hefty sum to play for a games designer that is still a bit of a one-trick pony.\n\nUpgrades, enhancements, new twists - they could all help keep it on the track. But for Mr Nadella to make it pay, he really needs the firm's developers to innovate rather than simply updating. He needs a new hit.\n\nBoth sides have been quick to stress that Minecraft will continue to be supported on other operating systems, such as Apple's OSX. As long as Apple plays ball, that is.\n\nBut the real prize would seem to be brand-new content exclusive to Microsoft that could drive mobile gamers into its eco-system, and perhaps provide a boost to lacklustre sales of Windows phones.\n\nThat's the big question mark hanging over this deal, particularly given the mixed record of similar transactions involving games designers. But perhaps Scrolls, the new card battle game that's about to come out of beta, could change that? Has Mr Nadella spotted a hit?\n\nIs the Union between England and Scotland about to come to an end?\n\nThe business community in much of Britain might be having kittens over the prospect, but London's financial markets don't appear overly troubled. Even with the polls showing the result on a knife edge.\n\nIf the Yes campaign squeaks home there may be a flutter, for the sake of form. Dealers may look up from their screens for a few seconds. They may even cast their eyes over some of the more-excitable comments. But then it'll be back to business as usual.\n\nUnless, of course, a forecaster somewhere downgrades China's growth prospects by a pip or two. Then it's all hands on deck, and sell, sell, sell.", "NEW HAVEN Conn. (Reuters) - The first defense witness in the trial of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland testified on Monday that Rowland performed legitimate consulting services for a nursing home company, countering prosecutors who say he worked under a phony contract in violation of federal campaign laws.\n\nRowland attended numerous meetings with top executives of Apple Healthcare in 2011 and 2012, and offered \"helpful advice\" to the company, its chief operating officer Brian Bedard said on Monday.\n\nEarlier on Monday, after nearly two weeks of testimony in U.S. District Court in New Haven, the prosecution rested its case against Rowland, 57, who served prison time a decade ago on political corruption charges.\n\nProsecutors contend that the former Republican governor worked as a political adviser on the 2012 Republican congressional campaign of Lisa Wilson-Foley while being paid $35,000 through a phony contract with Apple, her husband Brian Foley's business.\n\nFederal campaign law requires candidates to disclose all paid consultants. Prosecutors say Wilson-Foley and her husband hid Rowland's role as a paid adviser to avoid negative publicity for her campaign, which was unsuccessful.\n\nRowland, who says he was a volunteer on the Wilson-Foley campaign, has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of violating federal campaign laws.\n\nIn his testimony, Bedard said Rowland actively participated in Apple's efforts to modernize and deal with the threat of unionization, and made other recommendations.\n\n\"The healthcare and nursing home industry was changing and Brian hired him as a consultant to help us move forward,\" Bedard testified. \"He knew the politics and practical ways to speed along Medicaid payments that were often delayed by between nine months to a year.\"\n\nBedard was asked by defense attorney Reid Weingarten if he believed Rowland's involvement with the company was a ruse designed to hide his role as a paid consultant for the Wilson-Foley campaign. \"No, never, absolutely not,\" Bedard said.\n\nEarlier, Rowland's defense team gave notice that it would ask U.S. District Court Judge Janet Arterton to dismiss all charges against him due to a lack of evidence.\n\nRowland served as governor from 1995 to 2004, when he pleaded guilty to accepting gifts from people who had been awarded lucrative state contracts. He served 10 months in prison.\n\nIn March, Wilson-Foley and Foley pleaded guilty to conspiring to make illegal campaign contributions, and Foley agreed to testify against Rowland at trial.", "HP issued a voluntary recall, explaining that a recently discovered overheating issue made the cords a \"fire and burn hazard.\"\n\nBy Malarie Gokey\n\nProvided by\n\nApple fans are responding to the two larger iPhone 6 models with great enthusiasm.

Apple's website and the sites of all the major carriers that were selling the new iPhones, including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, crashed frequently.

There is BarMax CA, a California bar exam prep app, and a couple of industrial apps like MobiGage and Agro. But the $999 app club has only a couple of members. This week, the exclusive group gained a new member as Vizzywig 4K debuted. This hyper-deluxe iPhone application \"captures full 4K resolution photos at the rate of 24 photos per second along with synched audio\" rather than capturing video. You can thus get really, really, really nice clips with your iPhone 5s.\n\nIs there any point pricing an app at a thousand bucks? Well, there might be.\n\nThe BarMax CA is actually bouncing into the list of top 40 educational iPad apps every couple of days and is even cracking into the top 400 of all iPad applications every now and then. Considering how few people are really into taking the California bar exam, it might make sense to go all out and squeeze those law school grads for all they're worth.\n\nThe same logic may apply to the extremely small pool of people who truly, deeply care about capturing 4K video quality on their iPhones. For those of us who care slightly less about iPhone video quality, there is also a somewhat more modest VizzyWig application that is priced at $30. This editing suite is more than 30 times cheaper than the one on VizzyWig 4K... and perhaps that is the point.\n\nA $30 price point is sky-high in the photo/video application category for the iPhone, but it suddenly seems cheap indeed when you compare it with the $1,000 price point.

New iPhone releases are regarded as a huge event to some and it's often difficult to not get caught up in the excitement and hype surrounding Apple and their new devices.\n\nSo great was the anticipation for new hardware, consumers took to pre-ordering them as soon as possible, resulting in the highest amount of pre-orders for an iPhone to date.

And even those who do really don't like it when you put files on their devices without asking.\n\nA week after giving away a U2 album to most iTunes users, Apple has announced a way for customers to get rid of it. The company released instructions on how to delete the album from an iCloud account, complete with a giant \"Remove Album\" button.\n\nSomewhere, a single tear is rolling down Bono's cheek.\n\nAt the end of Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch announcement last week, the company trotted out the rock supergroup to announce a major marketing collaboration.\n\nApple was giving away U2's first new album in five years, \"Songs of Innocence,\" to 500 million iTunes customers for free. It was a clever way to get more people to sign up for iTunes, and Apple even produced a special ad to promote the collaboration.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of just offering customers the option to download the album for free, Apple went ahead and gave it to them without asking. The album was dropped into the 500 million active iCloud accounts in 119 countries. The people who have their iCloud account set up to automatically download any purchases to their computers and mobile devices saw the files in their music libraries.\n\nMany complained that the way the album was distributed was invasive. It also came off as tone-deaf, since it happened so soon after iCloud's security was scrutinized for its part in high-profile celebrity photo hacks.\n\nApple spent up to $100 million on the U2 marketing campaign, according to The New York Times.\n\nRecommended", "NEW YORK: Microsoft's decision to spend $2.5 billion for the creator of the hit game \"Minecraft\" could help the Xbox maker grab attention on mobile phones, a new priority for the company.\n\nBut the move carries risks, as gamers can be fickle. Although the Lego-like multiplayer game is currently the top paid app for the iPhone and Android devices in the US, today's popular hit could be tomorrow's dud. The maker of the much obsessed-over \"Candy Crush Saga,\" for example, rode the game's popularity to go public this year, only to see its stock falter.\n\nIn addition, the founders of Mojang, the Swedish company behind \" Minecraft,\" aren't staying with Microsoft. That could raise questions about Mojang's ability to create another big hit.\n\nThen again, a big hit was not what co-founder Markus \"Notch\" Persson was after when he created the game, according to a blog post Monday from Mojang and a note from Persson himself on his website.\n\n\"It certainly seems like the founders of 'Minecraft' didn't want to continue forward,\" Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. \"It was something too big for them. 'Minecraft' is best in the hands of somebody who can take it in the direction it needs to go for the user.\"\n\nMicrosoft has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses _ Windows and Office software installed on desktops _ slow down or decline. With \"Minecraft,\" Blau said, Microsoft gains a new type of customer _ mobile players.\n\n\"'Minecraft' is very popular on mobile,\" Blau said. \"It has an audience that wouldn't necessarily think of Microsoft first. The mobile audience is typically Apple and Samsung.\"\n\n\"Minecraft\" is an \"open world\" game in gamer lingo, meaning it has no plot or outlined objectives. Players can explore and create virtual worlds built from blocky 3-D objects _ thus the frequent Lego comparisons.\n\n\"It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun rise over a blocky ocean. It's pretty. Brave players battle terrible things in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea,\" Minecraft's website explains.\n\nBesides iPhones and Android devices, the game is available on Windows, Macs, Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Microsoft said it will continue to make \"Minecraft\" available on all those platforms after the deal closes, expected this year.\n\nWith an all-ages \"E\" rating, the game has been downloaded 100 million times on personal computers since its debut in 2009, and it's the most popular online game on Microsoft's Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft, which released the first Xbox in 2001, also owns the blockbuster \"Halo\" video game franchise. Unlike \"Halo,\" though, \"Minecraft\" is especially popular with younger gamers whose parents might not be comfortable with them going on wild alien shootouts.", "Are you one of the 4 million? That's the number of iPhone and iPhone 6 Plus pre-orders during the first 24 hours, according to Apple. We don't have comparative number for iPhone 5s and 5c, as Apple gave a three-day figure of 9 million last year. But in September 2012, iPhone 5 topped 2 million the first day.\n\nIn one of the funnier Hitler parody videos, the dictator says: \"If Apple sold Jony Ive's gym sweat, millions would also buy that!\" (Ive is Apple's chief designer.) The point: Apple can sell millions of anything. CEO Tim Cook brags \"record sales\" -- and they're nothing to snicker about -- but would you expect anything less?\n\n\"We are thrilled customers love them as much as we do\", Cook says of the new iPhones. Lucky thing, too. Lots of CEOs and their design teams love new Gadgets A, B, or C -- but not the buying public. No one wants to make another Edsel, and the new iPhones risk no such fate -- if sales stay strong like these.\n\nApple is savvier than most tech companies massaging marketing bang. Last year's disclosure was for three days rather than one, suggesting slower first 24-hour pre-orders than iPhone 5. So spreading out the days maximizes the numbers. Still, sales could have been 3 million combined, when averaging the 9 million over three days.\n\nI ordered iPhone 6 directly from Verizon, which started taking pre-orders early -- a few minutes before Midnight PDT on September 11. The Plus is too big for my needs, as I expect it will be for the majority of existing iPhone owners. Verizon had my order processed by 12:04 a.m.\n\nWhat I want to know: Not how many, but how many of each? Is the backordered iPhone 6 Plus a big hit, or did Apple just not make enough? As I've repeatedly stated about Apple product launches: In business perception is everything, and supply shortages generate blogs and news stories and the appearance that the product is super hot-in-demand. Short-supply is worth millions in free marketing.\n\nThat said, my theory about the Plus is this: Gadget geeks and Android phablet owners account for the majority of early sales. You can help prove or disprove this hypothesis by commenting. Did you pre-order iPhone 6 Plus or plan to buy one? Why? What device do you use now?\n\nIf you want the Plus, which Apple Store Online lists as shipping in 3-4 weeks for all storage capacities from all U.S. carriers, queuing up for Friday's launch is the best option. I'll be at the Apple Store line here in San Diego asking buyers which model and why.\n\nBTW, who writes Apple press releases now? The one for the 24-hour announcement slaps on marketing keywords like thick frosting: \"record number\"; \"biggest advancements\"; \"better in every way\"; \"dramatically thin\"; and \"blazing fast performance\" -- or statements like \"Apple reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, defined the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad and has announced Apple Watch, its most personal device ever. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store\". Such dramatic claims Apple makes, and the press release is fun reading.\n\nMmmm, maybe there's more than one record here. In addition to first-day sales, there's the press release, which (and I'm being sincere here) deserves an advertising award for promotional writing. It's extraordinary. Like iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus? You tell me.", "At the end of its iPhone 6/6 Plus/Apple Watch launch last week, the tech giant kindly gave everyone a gift -- a free U2 album. Songs of Innocence is the first album from the Irish band in five years, and Apple made it instantly available to all 500 million plus iTunes registered users. Which was a nice thing to do, after all who doesn't like a free gift?\n\nIt turns out quite a few people were less than pleased to discover U2's new album appearing in their music collections whether they wanted it or not. If you're one of those people unhappy about the presence of the album, and despite hunting for an easy way of removing it, still haven't found what you're looking for, don't worry -- Apple has released a new tool for the job.\n\nAll you have to do is go to this link, hit the Remove Album button and log into your iTunes Store account. All reference to the album's existence will vanish. If you've already downloaded it, you'll need to manually delete the album from your device(s).\n\nIf you change your mind, and decide that yes, you do want the album after all, you'll be able to download it from iTunes for free (provided you do so before October 13 2014).", "As we all know, Apple last week announced two new iPhones, a payment service (ApplePay), and a line of Apple Watches that require iPhones to work. There's not much I can say about these products that you can't read somewhere else. They are bigger and better than what preceded them and -- in the case of ApplePay and the AppleWatch -- just different. They are all topnotch products that will stand out in the market and have good chances of being successful. So instead of writing about products we already know about, I'd like to write about moats to protect products from competition.\n\nMoats, as you know, are defensive fortifications typically built to surround castles, making them harder to storm. In order to even get to the castle, first you have to get past the moat which might be filled with water and that water might, in turn, be covered with burning oil.\n\nMoats are important in business because Berkshire-Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett likes moats. He likes the businesses in which he invests to have large and defensible product or service franchises with those defenses characterized as moats. Buffett's the guy who coined the term, in fact.\n\nWarren Buffett and his moats have also lately been a real pain in my ass.\n\nI have a book out, you see, called The Decline and Fall of IBM, and the easiest way to criticize my book is to ask, \"If you are right, Bob, and IBM is in big trouble, why does Warren Buffett (the numero uno investor in the whole danged world) have so much money invested in the company?\" Since this is a column about Apple, not IBM, I'll just say that Warren loves moats, Apple doesn't believe in them, and -- for the kinds of businesses Apple and IBM are in -- Apple is right and Warren is wrong.\n\nIt's easy to criticize Apple on moats because from the outside looking in it appears that Apple had the lead in PCs and lost it, had the lead in laser printers and lost it, had the lead in graphical workstations and lost it, had the lead in music players and saw it erode, had the lead in smart phones and lost it, had the lead in tablets and saw it erode, had the lead in video and music downloads and saw those erode, too. Apple appears to invent businesses then either lose them or watch them fade away. No moats.\n\nIf Apple had moats it would fight for market share based on price, shaving margins. If Apple had moats it would stop inventing new product categories because it would no longer have the need to invent new product categories. If Apple had moats, we're told, it make more money.\n\nBut wait a moment, isn't Apple already among the ten most profitable companies on Earth? How much more money does it need to make to be considered successful? If profits are the measure of business success, it's hard to see Apple as anything but the biggest technology business success of the 21st century.\n\nApple makes more money than any high tech company with a moat ever did including Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. So why have a moat?\n\nA moat is an insurance policy. Moats are attractive to people who don't have direct influence on the operations of the companies in which they invest. If Apple had moats, the idea goes, Apple could remain hugely profitable for years to come even with the loss of 50 corporate IQ points.\n\nCompanies with moats are supposed to be better prepared for enduring stupid mistakes or unforeseen market shifts.\n\nI know Apple fairly well and it doesn't like moats because it doesn't like playing defense. Instead of being able to withstand any assault, Apple sees itself as more of an Agile Fighting Force capable of taking the battle to any competitor in any market at any time. Apple doesn't want to survive the loss of 50 corporate IQ points because a dumbed-down Apple wouldn't be Apple. Been there, done that back in the 1990s under Sculley, Spindler, and Amelio.\n\nApple would rather die than go back to those days.\n\nAnd so it counts on its products succeeding on merit, not low prices. It likes it that old product categories die and new categories replace them. It likes not having moats because moats reward only sloppy behavior.\n\nIt likes products and customers more than defensible franchises.\n\nIf Apple had built a moat around the Apple II would there have been a Macintosh? If it had built a moat around the Macintosh would there have been an iPod, an iPhone, or an iPad?", "I'm easing back into this weekly Else column, or put another way, I missed last week's Else due to preparations for NewCo SF, which I'm proud to say was a huge success.

One name of notable interest today is GT Advanced Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GTAT), as option bears continue to target the struggling stock.\n\nIt's been a terrible month for GT Advanced Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GTAT), which has shed 34% since the start of September. These losses are accelerating today -- with the equity down 1.4% at $11.71 -- as GTAT continues to feel the sting of last week's Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) snub. Against this backdrop, put volume has been picking up speed, as evidenced by the equity's 10-day International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) put/call volume ratio of 0.77, which ranks in the bearishly skewed 91st annual percentile.\n\nIt's a similar set-up in today's session, with puts trading at more than seven times the average intraday pace. Meanwhile, the equity's 30-day at-the-money implied volatility (IV) has shot 12.1% higher to 80.8% -- higher than 84% of similar readings taken in the past year -- signaling elevated demand for GTAT's short-term options.\n\nMost active are the equity's October 12 and 17 puts, and it appears one speculator may be rolling down her bearish bets.

This is the problem we are addressing,\" Made With Code spokesperson Kate Parker told Efe news agency.\n\nThe initiative was launched in mid-June and, over the next three years, Google will set aside $50 million for the programme.\n\nThe project began against the backdrop of an ongoing debate about the lack of gender as well as racial diversity in the Silicon Valley.\n\nFor example, only 30 percent of Google's employees are women. A similar gender disparity, if not worse, exists in other companies like Twitter, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.\n\nTo resolve the problem, Google seeks to go to the root: the lack of interest among girls in programming and computer science, as only 18 percent of all students majoring in the subject in the US are women.\n\nThis figure is well below the 37 percent recorded during the 1980s, and the trend contributes to the existing male dominance in Silicon Valley.\n\nAccording to Google, this lack of interest among girls is due to them not relating programming with the fields of their interest, not realising that other girls do it too or not knowing that they can do well in this field.\n\n\"We look to change the perception about programming. We hope that once the girls see all the incredible things computers can do, they develop an interest in the subject,\" Parker said.\n\nMade With Code will organise events where girls will be invited to do programming together and discover that computer programme codes can be used to make and print bracelets using 3D printers, design accessories to superimpose on \"selfies\" or compose an instrumental piece.\n\n(Also See: Google Unveils First Set of Android Apps for Chrome OS)\n\nThe initiative will also have a strong virtual presence which Google considers as extremely important for a wider reach.\n\nThe website of Made With Code draws the attention of girls to the fact that many of the things they like are made using codes, and even includes simple classes to enable them to take their first steps in programming.\n\nThe website, which has pink overtones, also includes several videos where young people like Miral Kotb explain how coding and dance go hand-in-hand in Broadway musicals.\n\nIn other videos, girls successful in their fields narrate how computer technology can help to combat diseases and crime, design video games and create special-effects in movies made at Pixar studios.\n\n\"The message we are trying to convey is that programming and computer technology is a naturally creative field and serves as a gateway to many industries and other diverse fields,\" Parker emphasised.\n\n\"We want the girls to understand that basic knowledge of computers is necessary for anything they want to do when they grow up,\" she added.\n\nSusan Wojcicki, a Youtube representative, said during the launch of Made With Code that programming is \"a new form of alphabetisation and offers the possibility to create, innovate and, literally, change the world\".\n\nGoogle will seek the support of parents and teacher, which it considers crucial for the girls to progress in this field.\n\nThe company is also associated with organisations like the Girl Scouts of the USA, National Centre for Women and Information Technology, Teach for America and Unicef, among others, in order to present the initiative to young people in their networks.\n\nThe US Department of Labour estimates that by 2020 there will be over 1.4 million job vacancies in the field of computer science, but going by the present rate, only 30 percent of these posts will be filled by graduates from the US who are competent in the field.", "According to the report, The Cupertino-based giant declined to comment on the company's \"future plans for the NFC chip.\"\n\n(Also see: Apple a Decade Behind Japan Mobile Payment Curve)\n\nThe news might come as a shock to many who might have been waiting for the NFC connectivity feature on the iPhone models to use it in different ways (pair with speakers etc).

The app crash is said to arise due to a conflict for accelerometer data, as Android Wear smartwatches natively use accumulated data from the accelerometer to update the pedometer count.\n\nThe Android Wear bug reportedly forces a full-screen app using the accelerometer to shutdown, and the user is shown a pedometer card on the home screen of the smartwatch instead.\n\n\"I have an interactive Android Wear activity running in full screen mode.

Image: Jay Paul Company\n\nOffice development is booming in Santa Clara County. As the number of jobs increases, will the Valley Transportation Authority ramp up bus service to keep pace, or will streets become overrun with traffic?\n\nVTA hosted a public meeting last week to present a set of proposed changes to its bus service that the agency calls its North Central County Bus Improvement Plan, designed to adapt to commuting patterns created by the recent growth of large office parks in areas that lack transit. About 70 people, mostly seniors and residents of Sunnyvale, attended the meeting at Sunnyvale's City Hall.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of changes in land use in these four cities,\" said VTA Transportation Planner Adam Burger, who pointed to major office developments that are expected to bring several thousand more commuters through the region in coming years. Campuses are growing for Google and Intuit in Mountain View, Apple in Cupertino, Moffett Towers and LinkedIn in Sunnyvale, and the Levi's Stadium area in Santa Clara.\n\n\"All these land use changes create new travel demand,\" said Burger. \"So we have to adapt our bus system to match the new travel patterns that people use.\" VTA aims to provide major office developments with better transit and connect them to the bus rapid transit routes coming to El Camino Real in 2018 and Stevens Creek Boulevard in 2019.\n\nBut VTA only proposes improvements on a single north-south route that would help a significant number of passengers transfer to and from buses on the BRT routes. A new Bus 354 would supplement the existing Bus 54 with limited-stop service along a similar route on Mathilda and Hollenbeck Avenues between the Lockheed Martin Transit Center in Moffett Park and De Anza Community College in Cupertino. Despite large and growing concentrations of jobs in Moffett Park, along Mathilda Avenue, and in downtown Sunnyvale, Bus 54 still only runs every 30 minutes on weekdays and every 45 minutes on weekends.\n\nResidents expressed frustration at Tuesday's meeting that thousands of car commuters are now clogging local streets and highways in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara on their way to jobs in massive new corporate campuses, while few improvements are being made to the region's bus system.\n\n\"Office development is creating more north-south commutes,\" said Sunnyvale resident Holly Lofgren. \"We need a practical commute solution for it.\"\n\nThe VTA needs to act more urgently to improve transit service, former Sunnyvale mayor Tony Spitaleri told the crowd at a TransForm panel discussion on the future of transit on El Camino Real Thursday evening. \"Until we come up with a grid system that works to carry a lot more people north-south from Moffett Park all the way to De Anza, the Bus Rapid Transit project on El Camino will only serve to obstruct traffic,\" Spitaleri said. \"We continue to hear [from VTA], 'We're studying it'.\"\n\nMathilda/Hollenbeck was one of six potential bus rapid transit lines analyzed in VTA's 2009 Bus Rapid Transit Strategic Plan, but on that route VTA isn't moving forward with BRT-type improvements, such as frequent, all-day service with limited stops, bus signal priority, and dedicated bus lanes. Only the Alum Rock, El Camino Real, and Stevens Creek BRT projects have been chosen for implementation by 2019.\n\n\"Current transit demand is low, with few boardings in the middle of the corridor,\" the Mathilda/Hollenbeck corridor study states. \"Land use, congestion, and demand conditions warrant lower cost improvements to local service and bus stops.\"\n\n\"Just run the 54 bus every 15 or 20 minutes,\" bus rider Michael Ludwig told planners at Tuesday's meeting.\n\nVTA buses 54 and 55, which run north-south from De Anza Community College through downtown Sunnyvale to Moffett Park and northwest Santa Clara, respectively, averaged about 4,000 trips per weekday as of April 2013, despite running only every 30 minutes. In comparison, VTA's bus routes 23 and 323, which provide at least 15-minute frequency along Stevens Creek Boulevard, together carry just over 10,000 passengers, and many of these trips are on Bus 23's eastern segment between downtown San Jose and Alum Rock in east San Jose.\n\n\"The demand for better north-south transit is there, even though the frequency is 30 minutes,\" said Sunnyvale City Council Member David Whittum. \"Since that strategic study in 2009, which was based on economic data from 2008, with empty offices and high unemployment, we've had quite a lot of development.\"\n\nVTA also presented two \"study concepts\" for the northern and southern ends of the Mathilda/Hollenbeck corridor: a bus station at De Anza Community College and a \"circulator shuttle\" to the new Moffett Towers development on the western edge of Moffett Park.\n\nIn Mountain View, VTA proposes extending Bus 40 about one mile along Shoreline Boulevard to the Mountain View Caltrain Station from the route's current terminus on Shoreline Boulevard just north of Highway 101. Currently, no VTA bus connects downtown Mountain View with the city's North Bayshore office park, which can expand by up to 3.4 million square feet under the city's 2012 General Plan, bringing over 10,000 new workers to the area by 2030.\n\nOddly, Bus 328 was another north-south route proposed for improved service, despite minuscule ridership -- just 70 trips on an average weekday. The route has the second-lowest \"productivity,\" defined as boardings per hour per bus, out of 23 VTA bus routes serving northern Santa Clara County, according to a report by transportation consulting firm Nelson\\Nygaard. A third daily round-trip bus would be added to the existing two buses that carry peak-hour commuters from the extreme southern edge of San Jose's urbanized area, at the Almaden Expressway and Via Valiente, to Moffett Park.\n\nVTA also proposed three east-west bus route changes to address growing travel to new office developments in Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and Cupertino. A minor realignment of 1.5 miles of Bus 32's route from Central Expressway to Maude Avenue would serve commuters heading to well over one million square feet of new offices in Sunnyvale's Peery Park. A new east-west route running from the Sunnyvale Caltrain Station to north First Street in San Jose via Arques Avenue and Scott Boulevard would be added to \"introduce all-day service to this rapidly-growing office corridor.\" And Bus 53's current southern end in Saratoga would be re-routed east on Homestead Road, to \"reintroduce service to the Homestead corridor between Hollenbeck and Wolfe and improve connections between the Apple Campus 2 and future Stevens Creek Bus Rapid Transit.\" Finally, Bus 54 would extended south from De Anza Community College to replace the service to Saratoga currently provided by Bus 53.\n\nTwo other service changes VTA is considering are the direct result of Santa Clara's enormous City Place proposal, with offices, retail, restaurants, a hotel, and 380 housing units on the site of a city-owned golf course and BMX track. Because this \"mixed-use\" development would consist mostly of office space, it would hugely increase travel to the area near Levi's Stadium.\n\nNorth-south bus service would be established on Lafayette Street, \"contingent on future development in the Lafayette corridor, including the City Place Santa Clara project.\" VTA is also considering \"relocating the VTA hub in northern Santa Clara from the Old Ironsides Light Rail Station farther east, closer to Levi's Stadium and City Place.\" This new transit hub would likely result in the re-routing of several VTA buses that currently serve Great American Parkway and Tasman Drive.\n\nVTA says it plans to consider public input, analyze the potential ridership on the new and modified bus routes, and develop a detailed bus service improvement plan to be presented at additional public meetings in early 2015. If approved by the VTA Board in May, the service changes would be implemented in July 2015.", "From a proposed chemical company expansion and a rocket engine development office to a missions-oriented retailer and Birmingham Mayor William Bell in Japan, here's a look at some of Alabama's top business headlines from AL.com for Tuesday, Sept. 16:\n\nAM/NS Calvert to receive $46.7 million investment boost\n\nNASA says Boeing and SpaceX will build America's next human spaceships\n\nMadison Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Susie Masotti resigns after 3 years\n\nBirmingham's dirty little secret: The Nick Rocks to remain open 24-hours on weekends\n\nAlabama brewers discuss 'unquenchable' thirst for craft beer as U.S. brew production soars\n\nAnniston's Cheaha Brewing Co.

Hearing aids have come a long way since the bulky units that my grandmother wore. Today's hearing aids don't just look better, they also work much harder to help people with hearing problems tune into the world around them.\n\nI don't have significant hearing loss, which makes testing something like ReSound's LiNX hearing aid difficult. When you buy a LiNX it's fitted by an audiologist who tests your hearing and calibrates the hearing aid accordingly. While I sometimes have trouble picking out voices in a crowd, my hearing test results were surprisingly good. As such the LiNX didn't have to work too hard for me. I don't pretend to be fully qualified to judge whether or not it's a great hearing aid, but I can make a few observations as well as examine the iPhone-related features.\n\nHigh-tech hearing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe LiNX is actually a pair of hearing aids, each with an amplifier and battery compartment no bigger than your thumbnail. This bit is small enough to completely slip behind each ear and is available in a range of colours. A thin white strand hooks over the top of your ear and runs down to the tiny earpiece which fits snugly in your ear canal. Unless you spotted those white strands on each ear, you wouldn't even notice someone was wearing them.\n\nHearing aid technology has come a long way and the LiNX do much more than simply amplify certain frequencies in an effort to make voices clearer. The earpieces work in tandem wirelessly to locate sounds and then run some powerful audio processing in an effort to only amplify what you want to hear. They also compensate for different environments, such as traffic or loud workplaces.\n\nYou generally schedule a follow-up appointment with your audiologist to fine-tune the settings, but I only used the LiNX for a few days so I didn't make this appointment. Even so I could hear them working.\n\nOff to the pub\n\nThe audio processing is noticeable when you turn up the volume because only the voices around you get louder. They certainly made it easier to converse with my drinking buddy when put to the test in a noisy pub during a footy match.\n\nInterestingly the LiNX also plucked out the commentator's voice from the television across the room and I could hear the dulcet tones of Dennis Cometti get louder as I adjusted the volume with my iPhone, even though the significant background noise remained at the same volume. In a quiet environment I sometimes heard my own voice coming back to me with a slightly metallic twang, but a follow up appointment can help minimise this. Also, if you have hearing issues you're less likely to detect this.\n\nWhile the LiNX are built with iGadgets in mind, thankfully you don't need an iPhone to take advantage of the noise processing features. The hearing aids adapt on the fly to your environment and your audiologist can even program special pre-sets if you spend a lot of time in specific noisy environments such as factories.\n\niPhone features\n\nIf you do have an iPhone you can control the LiNX via Bluetooth 4.0, as well as take advantage of iOS' extensive accessibility features. It's officially certified by Apple as part of its \"Made for iPhone\" program. You can control some features from an Android device, although you need the ReSound Unite Phone Clip+ to act as the middleman, and even then the app has received mixed reviews.\n\nThe LiNX iPhone app lets you manually adjust the volume, plus you can create your own basic presets for locations such as the pub and set them to kick in automatically when you return, relying on the GPS in your phone. The earpieces fit very snugly and they're unlikely to dislodge even if you're running down the street. If you do lose them, your phone can tell you where it last saw them and show you on a map. If the hearing aids are nearby the app can even use the signal strength to hone in on them.\n\nApart from the ReSound app, you can also triple click on your iPhone's home button at any time in order to access iOS' accessibility features. This includes adjusting the volume, making hands-free calls, playing music, listening to sat-nav commands or even using the iPhone as a remote microphone - so you can place it on the table in meetings up close to the person speaking.\n\nIf you don't have an iPhone you can also get standalone Bluetooth microphone to do this job. Bluetooth adaptors are also available for other devices like your television, plus a Bluetooth remote in place of the iPhone app. The hands-free calls didn't sounds as rich and clear as the iPhone's built-in speaker, but you might hear things differently.\n\nOne significant drawback of the LiNX is that it doesn't feature a telecoil, which lets you tap into public broadcasts such as announcements in train stations and many other public spaces. The lack of a telecoil helps reduce the size of the hearing aids, but you need to decide for yourself whether it's worth trading telecoil support for Bluetooth support. The LiNX might improve your hearing to the point where you don't need a telecoil, but it's certainly something to keep in mind when evaluating hearing aids.\n\nSo what's the verdict?\n\nThe LiNX hearing aids aren't cheap, especially once you allow for visits to the audiologist. ReSound are reluctant to put an exact price on them, because it's only a wholesaler, but expect to part with at least $5000 all up - maybe closer to $10,000 depending on where you shop. That's a lot of money, but it's hard to put a price on quality of life. My only other major complaint is the impact on your iPhone's battery, like all the Bluetooth 4.0 devices I've tested lately. Bluetooth also cuts down the LiNX's batttery time to less than a week, so you might not want to leave it running all day. Battery issues are frustrating, but throwing spare batteries and a portable charger in your carry bag is a small price to pay in order to clearly hear what everyone else takes for granted.", "Now when a Netflix viewer finishes watching a selection, they'll be asked if they have any friends who'd also like the show.

The company announced on Monday that it sold 4 million iPhones in the first 24 hours. U.S. carrier AT&T also boasted that this has been its biggest iPhone preorder launch in history.\n\nThe iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus both became available for preorder on Friday September 12 at 12 p.m. PST in several countries, including the United States. Customers in the U.S. reported many problems during the first few hours after preorder opened up. Apple's website and the sites of all the major carriers that were selling the new iPhones, including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, crashed frequently.

Meanwhile, the smaller iPhone 6 has a 7-10 day ship date estimate.\n\nApple sold 9 million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C units during its first weekend of sales last year. So far, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are set on a record-breaking pace and it hasn't even arrived in stores yet.\n\nBoth iPhone 6 models will arrive in stores on Friday September 19 in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and the U.K. Apple plans to launch the new iPhones in dozens of other countries on September 26, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates.\n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends", "Need another reason to activate two-factor authentication on your Apple device?

After years of resisting the urge to upgrade iPhones with a larger display, Apple's two new smartphones are significantly larger than its current four-inch screen.

Apple said a \"significant\" number of the phones would be delivered to customers on Friday and later this month.\n\nIn-store sales of the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus open on Friday morning around the globe.\n\nTime zone differences mean Australian stores will be among the first in the world to open their doors on the day.", "TravelbyArt (free with one in-app purchase) is a unique iPhone app designed for seeing Paris through the eyes of some of the artists who worked there.\n\nThe app contains detailed looks at the lives of Ernest Hemingway, Edith Piaf and Pablo Picasso during their years in Paris.

When pre-orders went live last week, the company sold over 4 million units on the first day, more than double the number of pre-orders it received for the iPhone 5 in 2012. And as you might imagine, this record crush is making the long-awaited smartphone incredibly difficult to get.\n\nAt Verizon, the first batch of iPhone 6 phones available sold out almost immediately after the 3AM EDT launch last Tuesday. By the time I was personally able to connect to the site and place a pre-order for my mother, delivery dates were already pushed out to mid-October. The 5.5\" iPhone 6 Plus phone was in especially short supply, with pre-orders promising delivery a full month after its September 19 launch date.\n\nOther carriers have been swamped with orders as well. Pre-orders for the phone on the AT&T network now push as far as mid-November. Sprint promises delivery of the iPhone 6 Plus in 4 to 6 weeks; you could be waiting as long as 8 weeks to get one from T-Mobile. If you still haven't pre-ordered, your best bet is likely the Apple website - there, delivery is promised in just 3 to 4 weeks.\n\nCan't wait that long to get an iPhone 6? You do have a few options to get the device sooner. You could show up at an Apple retail store at launch this Friday. Each will have limited quantities on hand, but be prepared to arrive before sunrise to start your all-day wait to get one. Smaller cell retailers may have limited quantities available as well. You could also opt for the smaller 4.7\" iPhone 6, which is only backordered a week or two post-launch.\n\nThe new iPhone 6 boasts a 4.7-inch, 1334 x 750 Retina HD screen, a more powerful processor than before, camera enhancements and an NFC chip that powers the company's new Apple Pay offering. (And, sadly, only Apple Pay - the device doesn't allow for tap-to-pair syncing with accessories or the use of rival mobile wallets.) The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch, 1920 x 1080 screen and 20-50% better battery life than the smaller model. The 16GB iPhone 6 is available for $199 with a two-year contract; a 16GB iPhone 6 Plus will set you back $299. Most carriers are offering special iPhone trade-in deals, however, that could put a new iPhone 6 in your hands for free.", "Misfit, the company behind the Shine activity tracker (our pick last year for the best tracker for those who swim), has officially unveiled its second-ever product. Meet the Misfit Flash. It's a full-featured waterproof sleep and fitness tracker with a killer price tag: $49.99.\n\nThe Misfit Flash connects to your Android or iOS smartphone using Bluetooth. The Flash tracks steps, distance and calories burned for all sorts of activities via its 3-axis accelerometer, from running to cycling to active sports. You can monitor this data through the included app, or by simply pressing the front face of the device to get a quick check of your progress toward your daily goals. You can even wear the device to bed if you choose, allowing it to track your sleep quality, too.\n\nThe Flash can be worn on your wrist like the Jawbone UP or Fitbit Flex using its included strap. Or, you can use the included clip to simply attach Flash to your pants or shirt, a good option for those of us who detest that rash-causing sweaty wristband feeling. Clipping a tracker to your clothes may not be optimal for accuracy, but I find that I'm more willing to wear one during everyday activity if I can hide it on myself.\n\nOne feature I really like about the Misfit Flash is the battery. The tracker uses a standard CR2032 coin cell - a watch battery - that requires replacement once every four months or so. It's certainly less of a hassle to deal with than charging the device every night. These batteries retail for less than $1 each at Amazon, so they're not a major added expense.\n\nBoth Apple and Google have promised huge pushes towards fitness tracking this year on their smartphones - Apple with its new Health tracker on the iPhone 6 and in iOS 8; and Google with its competing fitness data aggregator. You'll need a tracker to actually use the features, of course, and that's why I like the Flash. It's an inexpensive way to get started. I mean, let's be honest - $100 or $200 is a lot to spend on a new technology that just might not be for you.\n\nThe $49.99 Misfit Flash will be available in seven different colors at major retailers like Best Buy, Target, Amazon and Walmart this October. You can pre-order the device now at misfit.com/flash. Before you do, however, you may want to read this guide to learn what type of activity tracker is best for your lifestyle.", "Apple has added an extra layer of security to the iCloud backup system in the form of two-factor authentication.

Also: Tesla leads tech stocks to a rebound.\n\nThe Lead: Netflix lands in Europe, but will it succeed?\n\nMuch like the titular character in one of its upcoming shows, \"Marco Polo,\" introduced Europe to Asia hundreds of years ago, Netflix is bringing Silicon Valley-style video streaming to Europe.\n\nBut will anyone care?\n\nThe Los Gatos video-on-demand company launched its streaming service in Germany on Tuesday, a day after Netflix made its debut in France, where it already faces criticism. Next on the company's schedule are four more European countries -- Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.\n\nThe costly expansion is expected to net Netflix as many as 6 million new subscribers, more than 10 percent of its current streaming subscription base. However, the company could have issues finding that many new customers if its content isn't tailored to the wants and needs of the specific countries, analysts believe.\n\n\"Viewers will search for the shows they know, and if they can't find them, they'll never subscribe,\" Gilles Fontaine, a Digiworld analyst based in France, told Bloomberg News.\n\nWhile Netflix has secured the rights to a couple of German shows -- \"Stromberg\" and \"Der Tatortreiniger\" -- and plans an original show for the French market called \"Marseille,\" success or failure could depend on the popularity of its U.S.-focused original shows such as \"Orange is the New Black\" and second-run American TV shows it does not own the U.S. rights to, such as \"Modern Family.\"\n\n\"They're going to either thrive or fail based on their ability to pick the shows that work the best,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Bloomberg Television.\n\nCEO and co-founder Reed Hastings told Reuters in an interview that Netflix is looking long-term, with plans to add to its content lineup while attempting to convince French cable companies to provide access to Netflix through their cable boxes.\n\n\"After launch is when the real work begins: improving the content being offered and getting on set-top boxes,\" Hastings said.\n\nAs it spends big to expand into new countries, Netflix is still shoveling money at Hollywood for U.S. shows, as well. On Tuesday, the company announced that it had agreed to a two-season deal for a new television show from Judd Apatow, called \"Love.\"\n\nNetflix had to fight off Hulu for the show, Variety reported, and guaranteed two seasons to an untested show for the first time since it landed \"House of Cards,\" the Kevin Spacey-helmed show that was the original spark for Netflix's recent critical acclaim for original series. Apatow's track record as a producer and writer of comedies seemingly helped, with Netflix already showing his TV series from the early 2000s, \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Undeclared\" -- both of those shows were canceled after one season.\n\n\"Netflix has been supportive in ways I couldn't create in my wildest fever dreams,\" Apatow said in Tuesday's announcement.\n\nNetflix stock dropped 0.2 percent to $456.91 on the day, and has fallen more than 4 percent so far this week.\n\nSV150 market report: Tesla bounces back along with Wall Street\n\nAfter Silicon Valley tech stocks slid hard Monday, Wall Street bounced back Tuesday with help from a Tesla Motors rebound.\n\nTesla had its worst day in months on Monday after a bullish analyst detailed the problems the Palo Alto carmaker has, but gained 2.7 percent to $260.74 Tuesday after a separate analyst checked in on the stock. ISI established coverage of Tesla on Tuesday, giving the stock a price target of $320 -- the same as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas -- and refuting at least a couple of issues Jonas brought up in his note on Monday. While Jonas considered other manufacturers' focus on hydrogen fuel cells to be a minus for Tesla, as it could stunt growth of electric-vehicle infrastructure and demand, ISI predicted that battery power would eventually win out and help Tesla. Jonas also doubted Tesla's entry into China, but ISI wrote, \"Examining China's electric vehicle policy, it is difficult to foresee an OEM better placed than Tesla to assist the government in meeting its (clean fuel vehicle) goals.\"Tesla CEO Elon Musk had more to celebrate than a stock gain Tuesday, as his SpaceX space-exploration company shared a big government contract to take U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nApple went against the grain and dropped 0.8 percent to $100.86 after the Subway food chain announced the impending arrival of NFC charge terminals, which should boost the coming Apple Pay mobile payments service, which is already being attacked by eBay's PayPal; eBay gained 1.3 percent to $51.61.

It fills up space on your iPhone... This is an invasion of my private space, my entertainment space...!\"\n\nThe rock matriarch went on to insist that U2's decision to give away their new material only causes more problems for the music industry, which is already struggling with falling sales figures, making it harder for new artists to survive.\n\nShe continued, \"They set a precedent that music is disposable, it's just another piece of software and it's nothing, you should give it away for free.\n\n\"Sorry guys... there's a whole new breed of artist coming up that need that money to survive to be able to continue to create.

The kids will \"have class in places such as coffee shops, tapping into free wireless networks to collaboratively edit texts, or visit city parks to photograph wildflowers before researching them online. They will spend roughly half their time out and about, and the rest at a rented space in the heart of Houston's Museum District,\" the Journal says.\n\nIndeed, one industry after another is getting transformed as new uses for mobile technology go from the drawing board to the Big Board - and no one is being spared, no matter how large or well-heeled.\n\nFor example, long-established financial services firms are sweating under pressure from startups with no legacy baggage to tie them down and a proliferation of wireless applications they can offer customers to connect with. Now comes news that Apple is likely to add security features to its next generation smartphone to make mobile transactions more secure - and to help persuade consumers to at least try new services from non-traditional banking firms.\n\nTo be sure, the incumbents still have many advantages in all these areas, not least of which are deep pockets to fight legal battles and an established network of allies in the judicial and political world.\n\nAirbnb, which allows people to rent their apartments to one another - revolutionizing the hotel and tourism industry - is facing an investigation from New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman as it disrupts the hospitality industry (and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it provides).

But as Uber reportedly said, \"you can't put the brakes on progress.\"\n\nThe one-two punch of cloud computing and the incredible computing power contained in today's mobile devices is even leading to speculation about an \"uber for the electricity grid,\" something that would have been unthinkable even two years ago.\n\nThe ramifications of this mobile onslaught are clearly wide-ranging, and companies that wish to survive had better get on board - and soon. As Suhas Uliyar, VP Mobile Strategy, Product Management at Oracle, wrote recently for Computerworld UK, \"Mobile-centric strategies are the future of the enterprise; capable of transformations we are only just becoming aware of.\"\n\nWisely, Uliyar urges his readers to \"join the revolution.\" In the long term, there probably isn't any choice.\n\nSource: iStockphoto", "Copyright 2014 The Sacramento Bee.

But her husband, a former U.S. Forest Service employee, thought differently.\n\n\"I'm familiar with the terrain and how wildfires react - anyway they darn well please,\" Paul Sanders said.\n\nEventually, El Dorado County authorities and the local Swansboro fire chief told residents it was best to get out. The Sanders drove out Monday on Rock Creek Road, making it to a storage park in Placerville, where they climbed inside their pre-parked R.V. and slept there for the night.\n\nSwansboro resident Bonnie Miller left Tuesday morning. She navigated her sports utility vehicle down hairpin turns and over the nine-foot-wide Mosquito Bridge over the south fork of the American River.\n\n\"It didn't look like the fire had traveled that far and then, all of a sudden, we were being evacuated,\" Miller said Tuesday as she arrived at a Red Cross emergency shelter set up at the Seventh Day Adventist church in Camino.\n\nThe Swansboro evacuation came after fire officials previously declared that some 500 homes near Pollock Pines were endangered. Residents of 130 of those houses were ordered to evacuate Sunday.\n\nDespite its fury, the fire of unknown origin hasn't burned any structures.The Pollock Pines Elementary School District said Tuesday it would reopen all of its schools Wednesday. after closing Monday and Tuesday. Two injuries have been reported to firefighters, including one who suffered a broken arm. On Monday, a Northern California inmate crew escaped injuries after deploying portable fire shelters as the flames raced over.\n\nKristi Schroeder, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service, said the King Fire could burn for several more days before being contained. More than 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze, which was only 5 percent contained\n\n\"It's too early to predict right now,\" Schroeder said of the fire's potential duration. \"Because of the steep terrain and country, all variables are in play. The vegetation is critically dry. Everything from the pine needles on the ground to the trees is so much easier to burn that it makes the fire move very fast.\"\n\nSchroeder said authorities decided to urge residents of Swansboro Country to leave because \"you always want to evacuate ahead of the fire just to be safe.\"\n\nThe fire was spreading as the peak fall Apple Hill tourism season was approaching in El Dorado County.\n\nIn Camino, visitors stopping in to buy fresh-baked pies at the Mill View Ranch got an ominous bonus to the vista of apple orchards, vineyards and a pumpkin patch. Far off in the distance, a long, blackish band of smoke spanned the fire region. Just to the east, whiter clouds from the fire billowed high into the sky.\n\nFrancisco Perez, an employee working in a bake shop filled with tourists, said business was still brisk despite the fire. Roads to Apple Hill attractions remained open.\n\n\"It's still great up here, absolutely gorgeous,\" Perez said. \"The views are amazing. You can see the smoke. But we really don't have it in this area.\"\n\nDave Johnston, El Dorado County's air pollution control officer, said the smoke from the fire was mostly blowing away from local communities, sparing many residents of serious health effects.\n\nHowever, Johnson said smoke is being reported in areas including Foresthill, Truckee and Colfax in Placer County as well as North Lake Tahoe and Reno. Some of the smoke was also drifting into Central Valley areas, including Yuba, Sutter and Butte counties.\n\nIn areas with smoke, residents were urged to avoid strenuous exercise and people with respiratory or serious health conditions were advised to stay indoors.", "Well, sometimes the desktop site has more features, and some just look better, like YouTube.

John Rowland would be replacing him as the top executive at Apple Healthcare continued testimony as the defense's key witness in Rowland's federal campaign conspiracy trial.\n\nRowland, a convicted felon, is accused of conspiring to violate and obstruct federal campaign-reporting laws by failing to report his $35,000 in consulting fees from Brian Foley as a Lisa Wilson-Foley campaign expense. Rowland denies the accusations and is arguing that he performed valuable service for Apple Healthcare, and that his work for the campaign was done voluntarily.\n\nBrian Bedard, second in charge of the chain of 26 nursing homes, continued to paint a picture that was different than the one his boss, Brian Foley, did.\n\nBedard contends Rowland, with whom he says he met eight times during the six-month consulting deal, was doing meaningful work for Apple Healthcare, despite Mr. Foley's assertions that it was all a ruse and Rowland was actually being paid to work on his wife's 2012 congressional campaign.\n\nAmong the substantive meetings, Bedard testified that he met with Rowland and others inside Apple Healthcare on the subject of how to attack the problem of Medicaid as it relates to the state slowing down nursing home payments which. Bedard said if that happened it could be crippling to the company, which has a payroll of almost $2 million every week.\n\nRowland's attorney, Reid Weingarten, asked Bedard if he believed Rowland's involvement in any Apple Healthcare issues was a cover for work he was actually doing for Lisa Wilson-Foley's campaign. Bedard said no.\n\nOn cross-examination, the prosecution looked to discredit Bedard, who had previously testified that he had not helped draft the Rowland consulting agreement. The prosecution showed the jury an email Bedard had sent to Brian Foley dated Oct. 18, 2011. The email read \"working on consulting document between John and Apple,\" which the prosecution said was a contradiction to the prior testimony.\n\nAlso during cross-examination, Bedard admitted that Rowland, unlike all other consultants for Apple Healthcare, never met with key company directors. Just him.", "Apple may be forced to wait until 2015 to launch the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China, according to a report in 21st Century Business Herald [Google Translate]. If true, the delay could have consequences for the company both in terms of customer momentum in the critical Chinese market and overall earnings projections.\n\nSources with knowledge of the situation told 21st Century Business Herald that Apple's latest iPhone models have failed to receive the necessary approval from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). This certification is required for Apple to begin selling the iPhone in the Asian country. A re-application date for approval has not been determined, leaving Apple's Chinese iPhone 6 debut uncertain.\n\nApple unveiled the iPhone last week, announcing launch dates of September 19 for its first wave of markets and September 26 for a second wave of countries. Noticeably absent from either list was China, which is a region of significant growth for Apple. For the past year, Apple consistently has reported increased revenue growth from China, with plans to double its retail footprint and build out its channels in the coming years. Apple last year touted its progress in China, with the company having worked hard to ensure the iPhone 5s and 5c launched in the first group of countries.\n\nInitially, this year's China delay may impact Apple's important holiday quarter and affect its stock price over the coming months as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus expand to other countries except China. Demand for the iPhone 6 in China is high, with carriers having prematurely accepted pre-orders of the phone ahead of Apple's announcement.\n\nDue to such demand, Apple will have to battle the gray market in which resellers purchase iPhone 6 units in other countries, import them into mainland China and then sell the phones to wealthy Chinese consumers at exorbitant prices. iPhone 6 models already have started to appear in China ahead of this week's global launch.\n\nOver the long term, the delay may have a beneficial effect on subsequent quarters, which usually show a decline in iPhone sales and company revenue. If Apple were to launch the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in January 2015, the company may forestall this slump due to a spike in sales from Chinese consumers.\n\nThis delay also may help Apple balance supply and demand of the iPhone, which is selling out quickly in the regions that are currently accepting pre-orders. A 2015 launch would help Apple meet the current demand and ensure it has ample supply for a major Chinese launch at the beginning of next year.\n\nApple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus go on sale this week starting Friday, September 19 in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK. A second round of sales will begin September 26 in 20 additional markets, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and more. Contract pricing starts at $199 for the 16 GB iPhone 6 and $299 for the larger 16 GB iPhone 6 Plus.", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized Washington-based court that handles patent appeals, ruled the verdict was \"tainted\" by erroneous jury instructions in the case.

Fred Upton was walking down Pennsylvania Avenue when he happened upon White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.\n\nThey are political foes. Upton, a Republican from Michigan, chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. McDonough is the right hand of Democratic presidential power.\n\nUpton went for the jugular: He asked McDonough how many steps he had taken that day. They held up their wrists, their step totals displayed on their Nike Fuelbands and Fitbits.\n\n\"I was winning,\" said Upton, whose one-day record is nearly 18,000 steps. \"So that's a good thing.\"\n\nThis is the new Washington rat race. In a town that hits DefCon 1 on just about any issue, lawmakers, administration officials, congressional staffers, diplomats and bureaucrats have found something healthy and bipartisan to compete over: the number of steps they walk each day. In the era of political gridlock, at least they're trying to move physically.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) is obsessed with his Jawbone Up band and regularly checks in with 10 other band wearers in his office: \"Hey, you getting in your steps?\" Hill staffers have formed Facebook groups to share -- and gloat about -- their step totals. The State Department recently held a five-week walking competition. Team names included Agony of De Feet and Holy Walkamolies.\n\n\"The type of people you find on Capitol Hill are very competitive by nature,\" said Alexa Marrero, a senior aide to Upton who competes with him. (He accuses her of cheating by moving to the Hill so she could walk to work.) \"You have a bunch of type-A personalities in jobs prone to keeping you behind a desk all day, so there are a lot of people who have found this as a fun way to get up.\"\n\nThe competitions are changing official Washington behavior in some corners. Elected officials insist on parking far away for meetings to get in their 10,000 steps a day, the total often recommended by fitness experts and dietitians. Legislative correspondents -- they are underdogs in competitions because they answer e-mails all day -- are finding ways to be at their desks less. Boehner's staff even holds meetings in the Capitol Rotunda while walking in circles, which is not meant to be a metaphor for Washington politics.\n\n\"It's much more pleasant to walk around this beautiful building than sit in some bland conference room,\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel, who uses a Fitbit.\n\nPolitical Washington has entered the realm of the Quantified Self. Sensors inside smartphones and wrist bands like the Fitbit can track steps, calories burned, heart rates, and even sleep patterns. Users link up on Web sites or apps to see how many steps their friends or colleagues have taken. Trash talking ensues.\n\n\"You can send happy faces or sad faces,\" said Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), a devoted step tracker. \"That sort of stuff.\"\n\nHow many step trackers there are in Washington is impossible to know, but there are some hints about the city's collective walking capacity. Jawbone has stats showing its D.C. users average about 8,262 steps a day, which is less than U.S. leaders New York at 8,704 steps and Boston at 8,471. D.C. beats slender and tony Miami, which somehow manages only 6,734 steps per day.\n\nTracking steps is still in its early days. Of the 60 percent of U.S. adults who say they track their weight, diet or fitness, just 9 percent use an app or online tool to keep up with stats, according to Pew Research Center. Analysts project that number will grow considerably next year with the introduction of Apple's new watch. Unveiled last week, the watch will track fitness and, as with many Apple products, likely turn a new idea mainstream.\n\nStudies show that using pedometers and other devices to track activity can improve health by motivating positive behaviors. When competition or teamwork is involved, walkers are less likely to relegate their tracking devices to a drawer in the same way that many people turn their treadmills into expensive clothes hangers, experts say.\n\nIn a competitive sense, Washington -- a city filled with people who abhor losing -- is perfect for a bit of political Fitbit fisticuffs. Those who tout their performance can prompt others to jump in.\n\nThis summer, Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.) began posting his walking results on Instagram from an iPhone app called Moves. He notched an all-time record on July 23: 4.9 miles, or about 10,000 steps.\n\nStaffers in the office of Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) saw his posts and downloaded the app. Samantha Slater, Israel's communications director, became obsessed soon after. To avoid missing out on recorded steps, she takes her phone to the bathroom despite the water hazards for expensive electronics. On vacation in France, she sent her Moves-using colleague Kyle Hill an e-mail boasting about the 15.1 miles she walked in one day.\n\nIn some offices, tracking is a behavior that comes from the top. Stacey McClure, Boozman's state director, said she began using a tracking bracelet after the senator did.\n\n\"If it's important to the boss,\" McClure said, \"it's important to the staff.\"\n\nShe quickly found out how important it was when instead of dropping him off at an event, he asked her to park far away.\n\n\"It's 98 degrees out, I have heels on, but yes, let's go park far away,\" McClure recalls thinking. \"Great idea.\"\n\nBut she adjusted well. While working in Arkansas, she often monitors her colleagues in Washington online and, when appropriate, sends messages such as, \"Were you off all week? Were you sick all week? Did you break a leg?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Boozman said other senators have asked about his bracelet. He has encouraged them to (ahem) follow in his footsteps, but he needs to be careful about who he convinces. \"I need to figure out who I can beat first,\" he said. \"I need to find a lazy senator or two.\"\n\nNot everyone in Congress has embraced the walkathon. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)recently complained about the privacy aspects of devices such as the Fitbit. His staff did not respond to a question about whether he or his staff use the devices, but it's not as if Schumer is opposed to walking briskly. As former senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) once observed, \"The most dangerous place in Washington is between Charles Schumer and a television camera.\"\n\nThere is at least one downside to walking and governing. Boozman and staffers have found that going home to their districts is disastrous for their step counts. In Washington, the business of government requires physical, if not ideological, movement. Officials walk to meetings, to the floor for votes, and down the street for lunch. Back home, they drive around, sometimes for eight hours a day.\n\n\"I'll only do a thousand steps back home,\" Boozman said. \"And I'm still tired. So it really wakes you up. We're really blessed in Washington because of the way things are laid out. You walk more. You can take the steps more.\"\n\nSome lower level staffers have taken to just competing with themselves.\n\nSarah Czufin, a 23-year-old legislative correspondent for Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), uses a Jawbone UP that vibrates once an hour to remind her to collect her steps. Making sure she walks enough is important, she said, because \"my job takes place at my desk\" and after work is filled with receptions featuring free, often fried, appetizers.\n\nShe will do just about anything to hit her numbers, including walking back and forth down a hallway during a phone interview that netted her 673 steps.", "Fuel for Pages is an amazing add-on for Apple's Pages app. It provides 168 templates in 11 categories.

Because the next set of problems Apple has to solve is so much less fun than the last.\n\nThe Macintosh made you a painter. The iPod put 1,000 songs in your pocket. The iPhone turned us all into amateur photographers. Then the iPad offered up a blank canvas limited only by imagination.\n\nNow what does the Apple Watch do? Functionally, its biggest breakthrough is that it can pay for things very conveniently, with just a tap of the wrist. Its biggest advertised feature is by all measures and accounts, boring.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple's success can be attributed to, as Steve Jobs put it, design innovations that live specifically at the intersection between technology and liberal arts. To be fair, the Apple Watch doesn't solve these types of problems, in part, because Apple has already solved so many of them. They already made the connected world accessible from your pocket. They already gave us a portable screen that we could draw pretty well on. The world will never be blown away by an MP3 player again. That moment came and went.\n\nI was disappointed by the Apple Watch announcement for the same reasons you may have been. Its industrial design, while featuring thoughtful elements like a magnetic clasp, easily swappable bands, and that clever \"digital crown\" navigation system, ostensibly resembled the smartwatches we've already seen from companies like Samsung and Motorola--as if Apple showed up casually late to a party they were too cool for, only to realize, everybody else there was wearing its same shoes. I mean, the iPhone floored you the first time you saw it, as if Apple had traveled to the future and stolen it back for all of us to share. The Apple Watch was a Samsung Galaxy Gear dipped in rose gold, the blush wine of the precious metal world.\n\nBut the bigger reason to be disappointed--the one that matters beyond my personal taste or our insatiable thirst for the new--is that the Apple Watch isn't connected to anything particularly beautiful or fun. Think about it: Every major Apple release has been grounded in some landmark support of multimedia, helpfully enabled by a breakthrough in user interaction. The Macintosh let you paint because it made your hand feel like a natural extension of the cursor on-screen. The iPod paired a deeply organized music collection with a wheel that could explore artists, albums, genres, and individual tracks with equal grace.\n\nWhether it was the iPad's touchscreen, or the iPod's music library, Apple devices either made you an artist, or gave you a better way to consume art. But the closest the Apple Watch comes to this idea is allowing you control your music from your wrist or scribble a doodle to beam to a friend. Nothing about the Apple Watch will fundamentally shift the way we experience TV, movies, photos or music. The Apple Watch has little appreciation for art or creativity.\n\nSo what design challenges lay ahead for Apple? Boring ones. Taking a cue from the Apple Watch, you see two highly lucrative, infrastructure-level problems: payments and health. They're certainly important problems worthy of Apple's attention, but that doesn't make them fun.\n\nPayments is the ultimate snoozefest. Yes, our credit card infrastructure is decades old. No, it's probably not secure enough to protect our accounts in the digital age. Yes, there is a better way. And Apple, by making deals with the likes of Visa and Mastercard, will be giving it to us because it will make them a whole lot of money, and the logical point of, why shouldn't your phone double as your wallet? We'll all use it, but nobody will be amazed because payments are boring.\n\nThe second big solution is health tracking. Health is really important. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. And maybe, just maybe, Apple can manage to exchange and combine my vitals with the data my health provider has to offer some kind of realtime analytics. I can barely begin to comprehend how important that could be. Building the right digital health is one of the biggest design, political, and infrastructural challenges of the modern era. But health data is boring. And when it isn't boring, it's worse; it's depressing or even devastating.\n\nDesign has evolved at breakneck speeds in the last decade, and we largely have Apple to thank for that, for lighting a fire under the entire industry of electronics manufacturers to think of their esoteric gadgets as fun, approachable experiences that can bring new moments of joy to our lives.\n\nHowever, Apple will have a tougher time standing out to consumers over the next decade because so many of the fun problems have already been solved. And the problems that remain are just as much, if not more, about solving boring infrastructural issues than they are about designing experiences that are truly new.\n\nWhy doesn't the Apple Watch truly revolutionize payments? Why doesn't it let us buy a can of Campbell's soup just by removing it from the shelf at a Walmart? The technology is capable. Apple's designers are more than clever enough to think up that idea, too.\n\nBut even if Apple has the innovative ideas, the infrastructure won't allow it yet. Walmart hasn't lined its shelves with NFC receivers, and who knows, maybe it would upset Visa for some reason, too. As a result of infrastructure, Apple's new shiny wallet on your wrist ends up looking just like Google's old tattered thing in your pocket.\n\nAnd after payments and health, consider what future issues are next: education, finances, environmental footprint, governmental communications, data security, and personal safety.\n\nThese ideas aren't fun. No silhouetted model wearing earbuds will ever be spotted dancing to the beat of your heart. But sometimes even the cool kids should stop having fun and tackle some of the world's real problems. And this begs the question: will the masses keep buying Apple products along the way?", "Getting one step closer to its mission to \"put the power of electronics in the hands of everyone,\" LittleBits Tuesday opened up bitLab, a marketplace for user generated LittleBits.\n\nLittleBits founder and CEO Ayah Bdeir likes to use the analogy of the iPhone app store to describe the Lab. \"If you think about the metaphor of apps for hardware, in our case the iPhone is the LittleBits library. It's the system,\" she explained to Fast Company. \"We want people to say, 'there's a bit for that,' and if there isn't one, they will make one.\"\n\nMuch like the app store opened up Apple's API to developers, LittleBits has opened up its world of snapping electronic modules, via the protoBit, a magnetic connector in the Hardware Development Kit that goes on sale today. \"It's a proprietary connector basically creating entry points into the system,\" says Bdeir. With that and the rest of the HDK, which also includes a perf board, tinkerers can plug in whatever they can think up and make it work with other bits.\n\n\"It's really limitless what you can do in terms of connecting any hardware systems,\" Paul Rothman, LittleBits' director of research and development, added.\n\nSomeone playing around with the HDK might design a Bit with bluetooth functionality, for example. Once designing the module, which LittleBits has tried to make as easy as possible with preloaded design files on its website, the potential piece goes up for vote on the bitLab site. If it gets more than 1,000 votes (for now), LittleBits will review it. If the creation is manufacturable, LittleBits will make it to look and work with all the other LittleBits, and put it up for sale on its website.\n\nAs for pricing, LittleBits doesn't have a cap or floor in mind. Existing Bits currently range from $8 to $59. But if someone builds something worth $300, LittleBits will sell it. Once on sale, 10% of the revenue from any purchases goes back to the developer.\n\nAlong with the recently released cloudBit and programmable Arduino connected Bit, Bdeir expects the bitLab to lead to a hardware revolution, akin to the explosion of apps over the last five years. \"Anyone with a couple of weeks can make the most popular game, or app, in the app store,\" she explained. \"In hardware that hasn't been the case. It's still very top down, very much closed. We believe that the innovations are not going to come from the Apples or the Googles, they're going to come from people.\"\n\nUntil now, prototyping a device took a lot of knowledge and money. With LittleBits, once the bit is designed, it just snaps into an already working system. Every time a new component is added, the maker doesn't have to reconfigure each part of the system. The Bits were created to be scalable. \"We don't know what you're going to connect to what. We have to account for billions and trillions of combinations,\" Bdeir said.\n\nIn theory, this could lead to a lot more prototyping a lot faster. People have already started to think big, filing their ideas to the DreamBits part of the LittleBits site. Bdeir expects a domino effect: as more Bits join the library, more people will think of different and new ideas.\n\nFor now, however, the \"innovations\" seem lightweight. Rothman demonstrated partnerships with MakeyMakey and Bare Conductive. By connecting the disparate systems, he was able to turn on a light with water and activate a synthesizer with an orange. In a more impressive hookup, he controlled his laptop's Photobooth program with a clap.\n\nBdeir recognizes that these early inventions aren't exactly world changing. But she envisions a ripple effect, much like what happened on the iPhone. \"When the app store first launched, a lot of the apps were fart apps or distort-your-face apps,\" she said. \"Now, there are a lot better fart apps, but there are apps to detect skin cancer and there are billion-dollar companies like Uber.\"", "In interview, the Apple CEO emphasized that company makes money off hardware, not personal data.\n\nTim Cook has a message for Apple users concerned about their privacy: \"You're not our product.\"\n\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose, the Apple CEO said the Cupertino, California company does not read users' emails or messages. \"If the government laid a subpoena on us to get your iMessages, we can't provide it. It's encrypted and we don't have the key. The door is closed,\" he said.\n\nCook emphasized that Apple's products are its hardware, not users' data. In contrast, companies that rely on advertising revenue, such as Facebook, collect information about their users to better deliver targeted ads. \"If they're making money mainly by collecting gobs of personal data, I think you have a right to be worried,\" Cook said. \"And you should really understand what's happening to that data, and the companies, I think, should be very transparent about it.\"", "THE Australian dollar has rebounded overnight, heading back up towards 91 US cents.

The government would only be able to ask phone companies for the data in a narrow set of circumstances....A long list of left- and libertarian-leaning groups ranging from the ACLU to the Council on American Islamic Relations to FreedomWorks, as well as a number of major tech companies, have endorsed the bill...'This bill a is a fraud,' charged whistleblower Mark Klein, who revealed AT&T's cooperation with the NSA in the early 2000s.

I'm planning on it,' he said...The contest is all but guaranteed to be heated. While the electoral map favors Republicans this year, 2016 will be a different story. Seven Republicans from states won by President Obama last cycle will face reelection. North Carolina isn't quite in that category -- Mitt Romney narrowly carried the state in 2012 -- but Obama won it in 2008 and Democrats are optimistic that their turnout will jump again in 2016...Democrats are angling for a top-tier recruit in 2016, hopeful that former Charlotte Mayor and current Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx might decide to run.

You just didn't know it.\n\nLike the \"Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China,\" note festooned on Apple products for sale in the U.S., American companies large and small buy supplies or assembled goods from China for products sold here.\n\nSince its inception in 1999, Alibaba has been catering to Western companies as a business-to-business portal that connects suppliers and manufacturers in China with commercial customers globally. Alibaba's customers make and sell just about anything you can name: buttons for shirts, components for smartphones, bulldozers for construction companies or dog bowls for pet stores.\n\nIn China, Alibaba is now Amazon, eBay and PayPal all rolled up into one. Alibaba makes its cash acting as a matchmaker among businesses -- and increasingly hooking up Chinese consumers with direct online sales. The company gets paid through commissions and online advertising on its sites.\n\nAliPay, Alibaba's online payment service, handles half of all online transactions in China, the world's No. 1 Internet market with a mind-blowing 618 million people online -- nearly double the population of the U.S.\n\nAlibaba's online auction site, Taobao, helped shutter eBay's early entry into China. Analysts say Alibaba showed it understood Chinese consumers better than the eBay, which just migrated its U.S. business model to China.\n\n\"Taobao was quick to recognize that people wanted to buy new products online rather than secondhand goods,\" Edward Yu, chief executive of Analysys, a Beijing market analysis company, told me in 2010. EBay, which had 79% market share in China when Taobao opened in 2003, left China in 2006 after its business there cratered. EBay now is back in China -- but with a much lower market share.\n\nNew businesses, such as Tmall Global, are helping foreign companies tap into the growing spending power in China by selling directly to Chinese consumers -- a boon in a nation rife with counterfeit products and concerns about domestic food after tainted formula poisoned tens of thousands of babies in 2008.\n\nBut there still are concerns that Alibaba can be like the \"Wild West\" when it comes to the flow of illegal goods. The Financial Times notes a recent ad on Alibaba for the rare metal gallium, used to stabilize plutonium. (Alibaba later took down the listing.) That comes after the FBI used Alibaba in a botched sting with an ad looking for yellowcake, a partially refined uranium ore used for nuclear weapons. The Sierra Leone man who answered the ad was arrested, but later acquitted in Florida.\n\nAlibaba is using its IPO to bankroll global expansion. But for U.S. investors wondering whether to buy into the IPO, the company's lock on the Chinese e-commerce market may hold the most appeal for those wanting to cash in on China's explosive growth.\n\nFor investors looking for opportunities in China, \"Alibaba is a top pick,\" Henry Guo, senior research analyst at JG Capital, tells NerdWallet. \"This company is well prepared to dominate there over the next 5 to 10 years.\"", "NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks posted solid gains on Tuesday (Sep 16) following reports of a new Chinese stimulus plan as investors awaited Wednesday's US Federal Reserve monetary policy announcement.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 100.83 points (0.59 percent) to 17,131.97.

That trend can mean a double-whammy for states: The wealthy often manage to shield much of their income from taxes, and they tend to spend less of it than others do, thereby limiting sales tax revenue.\n\nAs the growth of tax revenue has slowed, states have faced tensions over whether to raise taxes or cut spending to balance their budgets as required by law.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, government data show that median household income rose by a few thousand dollars since 1979 to $51,017 in 2012 and remains below its level before the recession began in late 2007. By contrast, the top 1 percent has thrived. Their incomes averaged $1.26 million in 2012, up from $466,302 in 1979, according IRS data.\n\nBefore income inequality began to rise consistently, state tax revenue grew an average of 9.97 percent a year from 1950 to 1979. That average steadily fell with each subsequent decade, dipping to 3.62 percent between 2000 and 2009.\n\nState tax revenue growth has risen slightly since then as the economy has recovered and some states -- California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, for example -- have adopted higher top marginal income tax rates, according to S&P.\n\n\u25cf United Airlines is offering its flight attendants buyouts of as much as $100,000 as it seeks to rein in costs.

Gathering expert testimony and a bright mix of archival material, their film champions gas station alternatives that go way beyond premium and regular. The historical overview they provide is insightful and lucid, yet their polished production intermittently lapses into dry chronology while they bury the lead. The headline is that most cars on today's roads could easily run on non-petroleum fuels that are cheaper, cleaner and more plentiful than gasoline. At the heart of the doc is ultra-practical information with the potential to galvanize a broad audience.\n\nThe Tickells don't argue against the car itself, even in their incisive portrait of China's transformation from a bicycle culture to the world's largest auto market. Sounding warnings while emphasizing informed optimism, they don't preach to the converted. Their thesis transcends red-state/blue-state polarities. Issues of sustainability, geopolitical security and dollars-and-cents pragmatism all figure into writer Johnny O'Hara's narration, delivered by Jason Bateman in friendly educator mode.\n\nTracing Americans' love affair with the car and their lack of choice at the pump, the filmmakers spend more than half an hour on familiar backstory. It's important history, to be sure: the collusion between automakers and oil companies to destroy the electric trolley system, the rise of OPEC and the '70s gas crisis, the bankruptcy of Detroit. There are incisive points about oil's outsize role in U.S. foreign policy (and wars).\n\nThe directors and their interviewees connect the dots with concision, but for stretches of the first half the film feels like it's running on empty. The shift from quiet how-we-got-here outrage to hope, in the form of hands-on specifics, torques Pump and gives it momentum. From a well-illustrated lecture, the movie turns into an advocacy manual, illuminating information that Big Oil would rather keep under wraps. Joining the talking-head policy wonks are entrepreneurs and citizen hackers who have devised real solutions to counter oil's stranglehold.\n\nBeyond the promising looks at Tesla Motors honcho Elon Musk's luxury electric cars and Brazil's populist biofuel success, the eye-opener is that millions of American vehicles are already equipped to switch between gas and ethanol, whether they're ready-to-go -- and wildly under-promoted -- Flex Fuel cars, or other recent models that would require only a simple software tweak or kit installation. The further problem, of course, is the limited availability of gasoline alternatives. The road to reform remains a long one, with many U.S. legislators beholden to the oil industry.\n\nIn the meantime, Pump offers a map to true competition \u00e0 la Brazil's, and argues convincingly that there would be profound and wide-ranging benefits if American car owners were in the driver's seat when it comes to fuel-tank decisions.\n\nProduction companies: Fuel Freedom Foundation, iDeal Film Partners\n\nNarrator: Jason Bateman\n\nDirectors: Joshua Tickell, Rebecca Harrell Tickell\n\nScreenwriter: Johnny O'Hara\n\nProducers: Eyal Aronoff, Joseph \"Yossie\" Hollander, Rebecca Harrell Tickell\n\nExecutive producers: Jana Edelbaum, Rachel Cohen\n\nCo-executive producers: John Paul DeJoria, Burton Richie, Stephen Nemeth\n\nDirector of photography: Martin DiCicco", "Local shares are set to open flat on the back of a soft lead from overseas markets while iron ore posted its biggest one-day rise since March, surging 3.9 per cent overnight.\n\nWhat you need2know:\n\n* SPI futures up 1 point to 5474\n\n* AUD at 90.26 US cents, 96.73 Japanese yen, 69.77 Euro cents and 55.60 British pence.\n\n* On Wall St, S&P 500 flat, Dow -0.3%, Nasdaq -1%\n\n* In Europe, Euro Stoxx 50 -0.1%, FTSE flat, CAC -0.3%, DAX +0.1%\n\n* Iron ore jumps 3.9 per cent to $US85.20 per metric tonne\n\n* Spot gold up 0.3% to $US1233.44 an ounce\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* Brent oil adds 0.1% to $US98.04 per barrel\n\nWhat's on today\n\nAustralia: RBA board's September 2 meeting minutes, weekly consumer sentiment, RBA assistant governor Christopher Kent speaks on the economy in Sydney, ABS September-quarter commodities report, US August producer prices, US Federal Reserve FOMC begins two-day meeting (September 16-17).\n\nStocks to watch\n\n\u25a0 Hartleys Research has a \"speculative buy\" on Ironbark Zinc and a 12-month price target of 34\u00a2 a share as it sees the upside as still enormous if zinc prices keep going up.\n\n\u25a0 Hartleys Research was maintaining a \"neutral\" recommendation on Regis Resources on valuation grounds, but said it might update its model following the reporting of the full-year earnings results.

Over the coming week, a void of major local economic data alongside what is likely to be another rehashed set of RBA Minutes may leave the currency lacking catalysts to spark a recovery. The threshold for fresh news flow to yield a shift in sentiment is high, as demonstrated by the lacklustre response from traders to the phenomenal Australian August jobs report.\n\n\"On balance, recent local data and rhetoric from the Reserve Bank reinforces the prospect that rates will remain on hold over the near-term. Yet, the greatest risk posed to the Aussie is not from a shift in RBA policy expectations and a waning of its interest rate advantage, but rather the looming return of general market volatility.\n\n\"A persistent surge in expectations for large swings amongst the major currencies would make the Aussie's relatively small yield advantage a much less attractive (and riskier) proposition. This may open the door to a mass exodus from carry trades that had built on anticipation of a sustained lull in market activity. Long positioning among speculators is at its highest since April 2013 according to futures data, which suggests that once the floodgates open, they may be difficult to close.\n\n\"It will be difficult for the Aussie to recover back above the US92\u00a2 level, which is significant from a technical standpoint.\"\n\nCommodities\n\nIn China in August, Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, notes that pig iron production was up 0.2 per cent on a year ago with thermal power capacity down 11.3 per cent; computer equipment down 8.5 per cent; mobile phones down 2.3 per cent; flat glass down 3.8 per cent.

That makes you CEO, manager, head honcho, the leader, right?!\n\nNot necessarily. Being in charge is one thing - being a true leader is something entirely different.\n\nTo become a great leader, you must have certain qualities that motivate others to follow. In fact, we believe there are six qualities that do a great job of accomplishing just that.\n\nDon't worry - everyone possesses these characteristics, but some may have to dig a little deeper to bring them out. Just take a look at these six qualities of great leaders, and some of the best influencers who embody them, to enhance your leadership development.\n\n1. They're Enthusiastic\n\nInspiring others to care about a topic, industry, or even a product demands a bit of enthusiasm. It takes more than being passionate about your company, you have to show it as well. Others will then feed off of this positive energy to incorporate it into their own behavior.\n\nJust think about Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. Sister-in-law of Sergey Brin, founder of Google, Wojcicki displayed her enthusiasm for Google by hosting the search engine in her garage when it first began, and rising from there. First, she led AdWords and AdSense, but was called \"the most important Googler you've never heard of (Mercury News).\" She persevered and expressed her passion to lead in taking over YouTube in February of 2014; and nabbed the #12 spot on Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women list this year.\n\nHow are you able to explain the importance of your company, if you aren't able to do it eloquently? Whether it is through a networking event or a simple email to a co-worker, communication is everything. A Forbes article unveiled 10 Communication Secrets of Great Leaders which could help you understand how to hone in these skills. A few highlights from the article include having an open mind, and learning to simply \"shut-up and listen;\" both of which can be helpful in handling a dispute or just conducting a brainstorm.\n\nDon't get discouraged if you find this characteristic difficult to master. Most world leaders struggle with this skill every day. In fact, the Dalai Lama is often brought in to encourage conversation about education instead of violence in order to prove a point among communication-challenged leaders. He does so with a contagious charisma often displayed on his Twitter page.\n\nCuriosity is a characteristic often defined by constantly asking questions. And a great leader must know when it is appropriate to give a straight-forward answer or when to answer with a question. This is a tricky trait, because the method is only effective when it is the right question. Daring to push co-workers (or fellow leaders) further by asking questions to provoke otherwise unknown answers could be the ticket to innovation.\n\nElon Musk is a perfect example of such a leader. He constantly pushes the limits by asking questions about current technological capabilities to discover solutions to unrealized questions. Just read up on creations such as Tesla Motors and SpaceX if you need specific examples.\n\nYou must earn the right to call yourself a leader. The most powerful way to do so is through your decision-making skills. Knowing your goals, understanding the consequences, and deciding confidently are the ingredients in making a solid decision.\n\nTake a cue from leaders such as Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, for inspiration in swift decisiveness. In a recent article in The Guardian, Branson touches on how every decision he makes is with the brand in mind. Generally, Branson as a leader teaches you that if you want your name to be synonymous with your product or idea, you must be meticulously mindful in your decisions.\n\nHaving the power of decisions is exciting, but all the while daunting. Since we don't live in a perfect world, and there are many temptations to take \"the easy way,\" you must harness the qualities of a true leader. You must rely on using your morality meter to make the hard, but ethical, decision and do what is right for the whole of a company or group, not just you.\n\nThe most impactful leader who exhibits this characteristic is Malala Yousafzai. At just 16 years old, she realizes the difference between right and wrong, and does not hesitate to stand for the justice of the whole. At 11 years old, she stood up to the Taliban, and since then has unfailingly defended women's right to an education. She is a brave example of using ethical means to be a leader.\n\nIn the end, you must be completely, totally, utterly, and 100% committed to your goals for your venture. If you don't believe in what you want to achieve, nobody else will either. No matter the difficulties you face, or the hardships you must overcome, you have to show a dedication to succeeding.\n\nJeff Bezos of Amazon is exemplary at showing such a quality. He had a clear goal in pioneering internet commerce, and has changed to stay competitive with innovation only if it does not conflict with his branding goals. It was only a month ago that Amazon updated their login screen after more than a decade of what Bezos believed to have worked. So be sure to choose your goals carefully, because the best leaders stick to them!\n\n(Image Source: Fast Company)\n\nWhat other qualities do great leaders possess?

Analyst outside of the state think Nevada had the wool pulled over its eyes during the negotiation process, and it all because of the tax breaks.\n\nState lawmakers voted yes to a bill Wednesday night that would give close to $1.3 billion in tax incentives and credits to build a lithium-ion battery factory in the desert north of Reno.

The sum doesn't include millions of dollars in infrastructure improvements -- schools, highways and so on, which according to the L.A.

In most states, Tesla has won outright, or reached a compromise that allows the company to operate a handful of stores.\n\nThe decision also could be important in influencing other court decisions and legislation in other regions. As it stands, Tesla has filed a lawsuit in New Jersey, which has a law similar to the one in Massachusetts, arguing that it should be allowed to operate there under the current system. Early this year, the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission revoked Tesla's license for its two stores saying it hadn't met the conditions of the law.\n\nThe Massachusetts decision \"does have broader significance because the statute is similar to the way other statutes are structured,\" said Todd Maron, deputy general counsel for Tesla in an interview.\n\nDealers are trying to prevent contagion of the direct sales methodology to other auto makers. Today, every new car in the U.S. -- other than Tesla -- is sold through an independent dealer. Most states have a thicket of laws preventing manufacturers from terminating dealer franchise agreements and barring manufacturers from competing with the dealers.\n\nIn Georgia, the state limits sales from manufacturer-owned stores to 150 a year, a tight cap in a state that has among the highest sales of electric vehicles in the U.S. The state dealer association is petitioning to have Tesla's license to sell vehicles revoked, claiming the company sold more than its 150 limit in less than a year, in violation of state law, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle.\n\nMr. Maron said \"we're under the 150 limit and we don't think (the law) applies, regardless.\"\n\nDiarmuid O'Connell, Tesla business development director, said the company hopes to have new legislation introduced in Georgia next year that will seek to clarify its ability to sell there.

Tesla is based in Palo Alto and has a factory in Fremont.\n\n\"Nevada's tax breaks are California's benefit if we can get to our million electric cars,\" Brown said. \"And the cars come off the factory line right there in Fremont, and they'll keep coming as long as that Nevada plant actually gets built and they can put out batteries significantly cheaper than they do today.\"", "The state Supreme Judicial Court ruled today that automobile dealers lack standing to sue Tesla for operating what the California-based manufacturer of electric car calls a gallery at the Natick Mall.\n\nWIth its decision, the SJC upheld a lower court's decision to dismiss a suit brought by the Masachusetts Association of Automobile Dealers and a few individual dealers against Tesla.\n\nThe plaintiffs had argued that by displaying cars in the mall, Tesla was operating, as the SJC summarized the argument it in today's ruling: \"an automobile dealership showroom in the Natick Mall without a license and in violation of law which prohibits a manufacturer from owning a dealership.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs said they had the right to sue under a state law amended in 2002. The SJC held in today's ruling that the law at issue was written, even as amended, to protect dealers against manufacturers with which they were affiliated, not against competitors.\n\nThe traditional dealers say Tesla should not be able to sell cars in the state without operating a traditional dealership. Tesla, which eschews conventional dealerships, maintained that its Natick Mall installation wasn't directly involved in the selling of cars.\n\nThe case is Masachusetts Association of Automobile Dealers Inc. vs. Tesla Motors MA Inc.", "The author is a Forbes contributor.

For the director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development, however, the marathon was not quite over yet.\n\n\"I've got one more hour,\" Hill said, as he headed for the door.\n\nOne more hour before Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk appears side by side with Gov. Brian Sandoval.\n\nOne more hour before the Silver State lands a grand prize hewn in lithium and supported by a controversial $1.25 billion in incentives.\n\nOne more hour before history.\n\nIn the litany of stories that will now be shared among site selectors and economic development circles, the deal for Tesla's Gigafactory and the upstart state that won it will hold a place up high, said Dennis Donovan, principal for New Jersey-based site selection firm Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting.\n\n\"It will go down in the annals of history as one of the biggest economic development and manufacturing wins for any area,\" Donovan said.\n\nTHE POLITICS OF TESLA: Ray Hagar says the deal strains the \"One Nevada\" concept\n\nWith an impressive list of competitors that included such heavyweights as Texas and California, even members of Nevada's own negotiating team admitted they weren't sure the state would get the site.\n\nOf those who had some knowledge of the deal, only one man voiced supreme confidence in Nevada landing the Gigafactory. Sporting a cowboy hat on his head and a big smile on his face, Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center principal Lance Gilman worked the crowd during the Tesla announcement with the smoothness of a TV pitchman. Gilman, whose industrial park was chosen as the site for Tesla's massive battery factory, did not shy from calling Nevada the lead horse in this race even months before the announcement.\n\n\"I never thought it would go any other way,\" Gilman said.\n\nSTARTING BLOCK\n\nAs the leaves started to turn last autumn, so did the first page in Nevada's Tesla story.\n\nHill says he was driving to his office in Las Vegas when his smartphone started to ring. The call came from a man named Diarmuid O'Connell. O'Connel's unusual first name is not what ultimately caught Hill's attention, however. It was the fact that O'Connell is vice president of business development for Tesla.\n\nLooking back now, Hill described it as one of the most significant calls in the history of the state. Nevada was on Tesla's radar.\n\nLike the economic development version of an Akira Kurosawa samurai flick, the Silver State suddenly found itself in select company.\n\nSUPER MODELS: The highs and lows of Tesla cars\n\n\"We started the conversation (with Tesla) last October,\" Hill said. \"They invited seven states over to their factory for a tour and provided an outline of what they had in mind (for the Gigafactory).\"\n\nUnlike the Kurosawa movie, however, these seven participants were not allies but rivals in a game with high economic stakes. Those stakes include 6,500 jobs, a bigger presence in the highly prized technology sector, and the halo that comes with landing Tesla's $5 billion battery plant.\n\nIt's a reality that would bear out in the coming months as the chosen states worked feverishly to position themselves as the ideal location for the Tesla project. For its part, Nevada wasted no time in making its pitch.\n\n\"We had a period of time where we were moving pretty quickly to kind of give them an outline of what we had to offer,\" Hill said. \"We provided information on what sites were available, what their specifications would be, what kind of utility coverage they had, road infrastructure, that kind of thing.\"\n\nGilman even split the cost for renting a private jet to convince the Tesla team to visit Nevada. Gilman claims Tesla representatives were actually on the plane before the trip was cancelled.\n\n\"They were called off,\" Gilman said. \"But they could see how anxious we were to present Northern Nevada so they flew up here the next week and gave us a chance to sit down and get acquainted. That's where it all started.\"\n\nThe Nevada team's efforts paid off in December when Tesla came to take a closer look at what the state had to offer. Nevada showed the company nine sites that could potentially house the Gigafactory. Hill described it as a statewide effort.\n\n\"We showed them a handful of sites in both Southern Nevada and Northern Nevada,\" Hill said. \"Then we got into more detailed discussions after that.\"\n\nIt was at this point that the state's regional economic development offices became involved. Given the magnitude of the deal, negotiations were done primarily at the state level and through the governor's office, said Mike Kazmierski, president and CEO of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada.\n\nThe role of the regional offices was to come up with sites that met Tesla's needs, work out the workforce issues and get the necessary connections with partners such as the universities, Kazmierski said.\n\n\"Once the finalists were in play, the regional economic development authorities were brought in to do the show and tell for their regions,\" Kazmierski said. \"I don't know which site (Musk) saw first but I know he saw all of them in a short period of time.\"\n\nELECTRIC CHASE\n\nFour months after Nevada entered the discussion for Tesla's Gigafactory, the state received another big breakthrough.\n\nOn Feb. 26, Tesla whittled down the number of finalists for its battery plant site to four: Nevada, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico.\n\nAt the time, site selectors interviewed by the Reno Gazette-Journal thought New Mexico's lack of right-to-work status was a competitive disadvantage. Arizona's corporate income tax also was considered a drawback.\n\n\"The two leading contenders are Reno and San Antonio,\" said John Boyd, principal of New Jersey-based site selection firm, The Boyd Company.\n\nAlthough experts such as Boyd said just making it to the final four will do wonders for Nevada's image as a good place to do business, that was not enough for the state.\n\nIt had to close the deal.\n\nThis meant coming up with creative ways to craft an incentive package that would be enough to sway Tesla, even if it can't match Texas' sizable war chest for economic development.\n\nHill and Tesla declined to provide specifics about the give and take that occurred between both sides while finalizing the incentive package. The only clue prior to the announcement was a comment Musk made in July at a conference call with analysts. At the time, Musk said the winning state needs to foot 10 percent of the Gigafactory's cost, which equates to $500 million.\n\nNevada, however, was making a far larger bet. It was working on a package that was more than double the size people expected.\n\nHill shot down claims that Musk asked for a bigger incentive package from Nevada after initially agreeing to $500 million. People just assumed that was the number due to the earnings call but it was only part of what Tesla was actually negotiating for, Hill said. Instead, incentives were largely based on the starting offers made by the various states, according to Hill.\n\nThe $1.25 billion incentive package negotiated by Tesla makes the state's previous record holder -- Apple's $89 million in incentives for its Reno Technology Park data center -- seem like chump change.\n\nYou can bet that Tesla was quite aware of Apple's decision to build its data center in Northern Nevada and how it negotiated incentives with the state.\n\n\"We might have gotten Tesla's attention in part because of Apple,\" Kazmierski said.\n\nNevada also used its experience on the Apple deal in crafting some of the incentives for Tesla. In order to blunt competitor Oregon's advantage for not having sales tax, for example, the state created a tax abatement on Apple's manufacturing equipment. With Texas not charging sales tax as well, Nevada needed to fashion a similar deal for Tesla.\n\n\"In order to be competitive, we just weren't able to charge sales tax -- that was not a possibility,\" Hill said. \"If you look at our incentive package, $675 million of that is sales tax.\"\n\nTesla's incentive deal generated much debate in the days after the announcement as the Nevada Legislature created a special session to craft new laws to make it possible. Its sheer size meant a lot of sacrificial lambs for a state with limited resources, from cuts to film tax incentives and the elimination of a tax break program for insurance companies.\n\nTesla also will practically be operating tax-free in Nevada for a decade.\n\nGiven the rising stakes, however, Nevada's economic development team felt the deal was necessary.\n\nIn May, for example, California found itself back in the game as Gov. Jerry Brown made a significant push for the Gigafactory. Even Musk called the state a \"significant candidate\" as the state tried to work out environmental waivers for the Tesla project.\n\nThe move was enough to attract Texas' attention, which indulged in some gamesmanship of its own through Gov. Rick Perry the following month. Perry, who takes pride in tweaking California by encouraging its companies to move to the Lone Star State, hopped in a Tesla electric car for a drive past the state Capitol in Sacramento.\n\nNevada, which doesn't have the rock star status of California or Texas, simply hunkered down and took things one step at a time.\n\n\"A deal of this magnitude means that when you're successful in taking one step, there are still a number of steps in front of you that you'll need to take to achieve the results you're really after,\" Hill said. \"We had to take the steps to get the commitment.\"\n\nFINAL LAP\n\nWhile Perry was driving around California in a Tesla Model S, the groundwork was literally being set in Storey County for the next big step in Nevada's efforts for the Gigafactory.\n\nIn June, a records search by the Reno Gazette-Journal at the county's building department revealed paperwork for \"Project Tiger.\"\n\nThe secret project's specifications fit the description of a potential Gigafactory site.\n\nBy July, Tesla confirmed that the company has broke ground in Nevada.\n\nFor Nevada's economic development team, being the first site to break ground was a big deal for a couple of reasons. No. 1 was the fact that the state made it to the final round of selection. The second reason was it showed just how fast the state was in getting things done.\n\nMusk has always stressed speed to development as key in meeting the Gigafatory's tight building schedule -- a big reason why California tried to come up with environmental waivers for Tesla. Preparing and grading the proposed Gigafactory site at the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center only took three and a half weeks.\n\n\"I knew Lance (Gilman) and his team were faster than any gun in the West,\" Kazmierski said.\n\nAt the same time, Nevada could not rest yet. Tesla after all stressed that it was planning to break ground in as many as three sites during the final selection phase. California's Legislature, meanwhile, continued to be a wild card.\n\nAs Nevada's economic development team nervously waited for the final announcement, Gilman paid attention to what was going on in his industrial park and liked what he saw. Even as grading wrapped up for the site, one factor stayed the same.\n\n\"One thing I watched every day that most people didn't know about is that (Tesla's representatives) had offices out there and they never left,\" Gilman said. \"Their contractors never left. Their engineers never left. It was like they were just waiting for (the final announcement to be made).\"\n\nThen in Aug. 30, another big break arrived. The California Legislature failed to reach an agreement on environmental waivers for Tesla. For Kazmierski, that was the turning point that made him finally exhale.\n\n\"Every day that no announcement was made (for another site) was another day to our advantage because of the importance of speed to development for Tesla,\" Kazmierski said. \"But it wasn't until the California Legislature adjourned without a deal that I felt pretty confident.\"\n\nOn Sept. 2, Sandoval and his economic development received the news they have been waiting for. Tesla's Gigafactory was coming to Nevada.\n\nTwo days later Musk stood at the Nevada Capitol steps, singing the state's praises.\n\n\"What the people of Nevada have created is a state where you can be very agile, where you can move quickly and get things done,\" Musk said. \"It's a real get things done state. That was a really important part of the decision.\"\n\nAlthough Musk says his negotiation team hashed out the minutiae of the deal with Nevada, the Tesla CEO stressed that time to completion was the biggest factor in choosing Nevada. Given the importance of the Gigafactory and its mass-produced battery to the company's future, Tesla does not want to deal with stalled development, he said.\n\nPicking Nevada also wasn't just about the incentives, according to Musk, who added that Nevada's offer was not the largest. A few days later, San Antonio confirmed that its incentive offer was bigger than Nevada's.\n\nNevertheless, Musk's comment drew a quick quip from one of the architects of the Nevada deal during the Tesla announcement.\n\n\"This is the first time I heard that incentives were not the most important thing,\" Hill said as he took the podium after Musk, eliciting laughs from the gathered crowd.\n\nAlthough Hill and Nevada's economic development team can finally breathe a sigh of relief, however, the marathon apparently goes on.\n\nIn addition to the debate spurred by the multibillion dollar incentives the state handed to Tesla, there's also the matter of building the Gigafactory itself. Once finished, the 5 million-square-foot factory will be larger than all the world's lithium ion factories combined, Musk said.\n\nEven as Hill finally afforded himself a smile, he admits that a lot of work still needs to be done.\n\n\"It's their responsibility to build the Gigafactory but things are going to come up when you're dealing with a project that big,\" Hill said. \"We have to make sure we do everything we can to help them get to the finish line as quickly as possible because it's in all of our best interests. What we really want -- the goal for us really -- is the creation of all these great jobs.\"\n\nDiarmuid O'Connell, Tesla vice president of business development, holds a gift from Gov.

We are so focused on what impact Elon Musk ultimately will have on the car business that we miss the fact he is a super-achiever and a visionary.\n\nDon't shoot the messenger. But I honestly believe he's going to bust some of the dealer franchise laws in all 50 states. He ultimately will be responsible for manufacturer-direct sales in competition with franchised dealers.\n\nOh, we'll be kicking screaming, gouging and biting right up until the end. But it's coming, and after the dust settles, the industry will emerge better for it.\n\nWho is this guy Musk anyway? He's a South-African transplant who made his money as co-founder of PayPal in 2000. Revolutionary at the time, PayPal allowed people to pay online without using credit cards.\n\nHe has a contract with NASA to produce a commercial spacecraft to replace the Space Shuttle. This guy is the real deal, and his ultimate vision is space exploration with reusable spacecraft using something other than rocket propulsion.\n\nMusk also is the chairman and driving force behind \"Solar City,\" the first viable production of cheap solar electricity for residential and commercial use.\n\nAnd then there's his Tesla Motors, the electric car company that is challenging the traditional dealership system in favor of factory stores.\n\nBesides scaring the Bejesus out of the car dealers, he's also got the electric companies nationwide on the edge of their seats. His achievements and out-of-the-box thinking are awesome.\n\nMusk's personal net worth since manufacturing the Tesla EVs has tripled to more than $10 billion.\n\nAnd now, Tesla announced selection of Reno NV, as the site of a battery-pack factory. Projecting annual production of 500,000 units in the next five years, the Gigafactory is a $5 billion enterprise with $1.4 billion contributed by Panasonic and another $500 million plus concessions coming from the state of Nevada.\n\nSo, everything we know about Musk is that he's ambitious, tenacious, unconventional and well financed. He's never lost at anything he's attempted so far.\n\nDealer competition busted the Ford and General Motors initiatives to own and operate dealerships in certain markets back in the early 2000s. The automakers found they weren't good at retail and they retreated from the battle field bruised and wounded.\n\nThere will continue to be franchised dealers, even if they are coexisting with manufacturer-owned stores. Remember, the manufacturers are honor-bound to do the goofy-assed stuff that doesn't work even though they keep trying to get us to do.\n\nThe only reason it will work for Musk is that Tesla does not already have an established franchised dealer body.\n\nSo, the company is not competing against existing dealers representing the brand. If any other manufacturer with established dealers tried it, we'd kick their butts back to where they came from, as we've done in the past.\n\nFranchised dealers give consumers a competitive advantage with service and pricing. Factory-owned stores do not provide that.\n\nPolitically, consumers might think the protected dealer franchise system is not in their best interest. Dealers generally sell new cars at a loss or break even. The manufacturers make the lion share of the profit. With manufacturer control, margins and prices would increase.\n\nAll of that being said, I'll go back to the original statement: Musk will prevail in disassembling franchise laws that protect the current auto-retailing system. I'm not particularly happy about it, but, I am a realist.\n\nHe'll have a fight on his hands because the dealers and the dealer associations will go down swinging. It will cost him but, he's got money to spend.\n\nThe wild card is the fact that he has a lot of sympathetic eyes watching and ears listening in the current administration in Washington. There are a lot of politicians and some government agencies on his side of this argument. It wouldn't take much to swing it his way.\n\nThe Georgia Dealers Assn. has filed a complaint with the State Department of Revenue against Tesla Motors. The organization is seeking to revoke Tesla's license to sell cars in Georgia. The basis for the complaint is that Tesla is operating on a limited license that only allows it to sell 150 cars annually and it sold 174 units in the state.\n\nWe can keep Tesla busy defending what are basically nuisance suits. But it will prevail in all states one at a time. Or there will be some sort of sweeping federal action in its favor.\n\nI have a fairly strong track record when it comes to this type of prediction. Change is inevitable. As always, we'll roll with the punches and keep on keeping on.", "The following editorial appeared in the Los Angeles Times on Thursday, Sept. 11:\n\nTesla Motors, which recently wrangled more than $1 billion in tax breaks out of the state of Nevada, has proved itself unusually adept at obtaining government support for its private enterprise. But it's hardly alone in tapping state and local governments for incentives, such as tax credits for jobs created and money invested. All 50 states now offer one or more tax breaks designed to attract new businesses or prevent existing ones from moving, costing more than $80 billion annually in lost revenue.\n\nUnfortunately, few states actually go back and check to see whether the incentives they awarded boost the economy, rather than just the companies' fortunes. And while more states are working to improve accountability by making sure businesses do what they pledged to do when they were awarded the incentives, there's still relatively little work done to measure how much better off an incentive program has made the state as a whole, if at all.\n\nGovernments offer incentives on the theory that giving Company X a tax break or a handout will lead to more jobs and investment over the long run. Numerous studies, however, have raised doubts about that theory, suggesting that many incentive programs simply shift jobs around rather than creating new ones, or reward companies for steps they would have taken anyway.\n\nOf course, a state may be perfectly happy with a program that brings in jobs and investment at the expense of other states. Although winning the Tesla \"gigafactory\" cost Nevada up to $200,000 per job at the plant, it's still 6,500 jobs that might otherwise have gone somewhere else. Nevertheless, it's important for states to find out whether the breaks and subsidies they provide increase the state's economic output and wealth, rather than just assuming they do.\n\nAccording to the Pew Center on the States, only about 10 states do that kind of follow-up. The ones that do have found some eye-opening results. For example, when Louisiana checked on the 9,379 jobs that were supposed to be created with the help of its enterprise zone incentives in 2009, it found a likely net gain of only 3,000 jobs. That's because many of the projects would have occurred even without the incentives, and because some of the new jobs came at the expense of nearby competing businesses that scaled back or shut down.\n\nIt's impossible to say how much is too much to pay in incentives, considering that tax breaks are just one of many factors businesses consider in deciding where to invest. Some states, including California, take the partial step of demanding measurable results from their incentive programs, such as the number of employees hired and the amount of capital invested. But they need to go further, examining how those results ripple through the rest of the state or local economy. Only then can they tell whether an incentive delivers on its promise.", "Wall Street analysts are often criticized for being too bullish, so imagine the conundrum they face when they love a stock but still think it's risen too far, too fast.\n\nThat's the gist in Morgan Stanley's note on Tesla Motors Tesla Motors Monday morning, as the firm's analysts lined up behind the automaker's founder Elon Musk, who recently said the stock has gotten ahead of itself. (See \"A Brief History Of CEO Warnings About High-Flying Stocks.\")\n\n\"I think our stock is kind of high right now,\" Musk said, before adding that the long-term prospects are still bright, an assessment Morgan Stanley agreed with.\n\n\"We are big believers in Tesla's strategy,\" the analysts say. \"But we do not expect the stock to appreciate so consistently and one-directionally from here.\"\n\nThat would mark a diversion for a stock that has surged in more or less a straight line since January 2013.\n\nAmong the \"sobering factors\" Morgan Stanley highlights:\n\nTesla has bucked the trend of in the global vehicle market with a successful electric car. \"[T]he rest of the auto industry's efforts to successfully commercialize pure electric propulsion have fallen well short of the marl,\" the analysts write, and many big carmakers \"have put major EV development on ice.\" The supply/demand mismatch in China: \"We believe demand for the model S and X in China will far outstrip Tesla's ability to meet it, perhaps for many quarters or years to come\" due to the lack of a dealer and service infrastructure. Widespread adoption of EVs \"requires breakthroughs that may be too unreasonable to take for granted as a base case...We view Tesla as a niche player, not a mass manufacturer.\" The end of driving? Morgan Stanley's 15-year discounted cash flow model dovetails with the rise of autonomous cars. \"The rules are changing and at least some incumbent [automakers] (i.e. BMW) are not falling asleep at the (disappearing) steering wheel.\"\n\nThe analysts play both sides though, arguing that for all the risks they consider the stock could still be worth $320 \"but perhaps not as quickly and not for some of the reasons we believe are driving the market.\"\n\nShares of Tesla, down 7.3% at $258.78 Monday, are still up 72% year-to-date.\n\nTSLA data by YCharts\n\nFollow @SchaeferStreet", "Those sci-fi concepts you dreamt about as a kid seem to be on the cusp of reality more and more these days. From DARPA's tanks that duck and self-healing implants ( just like Wolverine) to Martine Rothblatt's glance into digital immortality, these are all concepts people are taking so seriously that they're closer to truth than fiction.\n\nIn that same vein, Elon Musk, the man behind SpaceX and Tesla Motors, appears to be our real-life Ray Bradbury character.\n\nIn something straight out of \"The Martian Chronicles,\" Musk said he has repeatedly eschewed an initial public offering for SpaceX because of his impressively outlandish endgame, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"The reason I haven't taken SpaceX public is the goals of SpaceX are very long-term ... to establish a city on Mars,\" the Canadian-American science impresario said last week in Tokyo.\n\nThe quote comes from a Bloomberg piece detailing the contenders for NASA's space taxi project. SpaceX is competing with mainstay The Boeing Co. and nascent Sierra Nevada (which supplies rockets for sub-orbital tourist trips on Virgin Galactic) for more than $3 billion in funding for a project to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station by 2017. An award is expected this month.\n\nLoren Thompson, an analyst with Arlington-based Lexington Institute, considers Boeing the safe choice, while SpaceX provides an exciting alternative, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBoeing might have the edge, not only because of its 50-year history with NASA, but because it was the first to complete an important design review for the project.

Despite all that, there's huge demand from around the world for the X.\n\n\"We can drive demand up at will,\" Musk continued, implying that if he was to release more information that about the X, demand would grow even higher. \"But if we drive it up too much, then people would get upset with us because they waited too long for their car . . . [W]hen I was visiting in China, the only unhappiness I saw was . . . because customers were upset about waiting too long for their car. So it's like, boy, we better not stoke demand in that situation.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment on the \"anti-sales\" concept, Tesla didn't provide much further information about how many deposits are currently in the bank for either the X or the S. The company also didn't elaborate on exactly how many customers set on a Model X have thrown up their hands and shelled out the $70,890 and up for a Model S. Tesla has not announced pricing for the X, but the SUV is widely expected to be cheaper than the S sedan. So for every Model S Tesla pushes on a prospective X customer, it ekes more dough that it would with a Model X -- and the money's hitting Tesla's coffers sooner than early 2015, when the X is to begin hitting customers' driveways.

Also: Tesla leads tech stocks to a rebound.\n\nThe Lead: Netflix lands in Europe, but will it succeed?\n\nMuch like the titular character in one of its upcoming shows, \"Marco Polo,\" introduced Europe to Asia hundreds of years ago, Netflix is bringing Silicon Valley-style video streaming to Europe.\n\nBut will anyone care?\n\nThe Los Gatos video-on-demand company launched its streaming service in Germany on Tuesday, a day after Netflix made its debut in France, where it already faces criticism. Next on the company's schedule are four more European countries -- Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.\n\nThe costly expansion is expected to net Netflix as many as 6 million new subscribers, more than 10 percent of its current streaming subscription base. However, the company could have issues finding that many new customers if its content isn't tailored to the wants and needs of the specific countries, analysts believe.\n\n\"Viewers will search for the shows they know, and if they can't find them, they'll never subscribe,\" Gilles Fontaine, a Digiworld analyst based in France, told Bloomberg News.\n\nWhile Netflix has secured the rights to a couple of German shows -- \"Stromberg\" and \"Der Tatortreiniger\" -- and plans an original show for the French market called \"Marseille,\" success or failure could depend on the popularity of its U.S.-focused original shows such as \"Orange is the New Black\" and second-run American TV shows it does not own the U.S. rights to, such as \"Modern Family.\"\n\n\"They're going to either thrive or fail based on their ability to pick the shows that work the best,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Bloomberg Television.\n\nCEO and co-founder Reed Hastings told Reuters in an interview that Netflix is looking long-term, with plans to add to its content lineup while attempting to convince French cable companies to provide access to Netflix through their cable boxes.\n\n\"After launch is when the real work begins: improving the content being offered and getting on set-top boxes,\" Hastings said.\n\nAs it spends big to expand into new countries, Netflix is still shoveling money at Hollywood for U.S. shows, as well. On Tuesday, the company announced that it had agreed to a two-season deal for a new television show from Judd Apatow, called \"Love.\"\n\nNetflix had to fight off Hulu for the show, Variety reported, and guaranteed two seasons to an untested show for the first time since it landed \"House of Cards,\" the Kevin Spacey-helmed show that was the original spark for Netflix's recent critical acclaim for original series. Apatow's track record as a producer and writer of comedies seemingly helped, with Netflix already showing his TV series from the early 2000s, \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Undeclared\" -- both of those shows were canceled after one season.\n\n\"Netflix has been supportive in ways I couldn't create in my wildest fever dreams,\" Apatow said in Tuesday's announcement.\n\nNetflix stock dropped 0.2 percent to $456.91 on the day, and has fallen more than 4 percent so far this week.\n\nSV150 market report: Tesla bounces back along with Wall Street\n\nAfter Silicon Valley tech stocks slid hard Monday, Wall Street bounced back Tuesday with help from a Tesla Motors rebound.\n\nTesla had its worst day in months on Monday after a bullish analyst detailed the problems the Palo Alto carmaker has, but gained 2.7 percent to $260.74 Tuesday after a separate analyst checked in on the stock. ISI established coverage of Tesla on Tuesday, giving the stock a price target of $320 -- the same as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas -- and refuting at least a couple of issues Jonas brought up in his note on Monday. While Jonas considered other manufacturers' focus on hydrogen fuel cells to be a minus for Tesla, as it could stunt growth of electric-vehicle infrastructure and demand, ISI predicted that battery power would eventually win out and help Tesla. Jonas also doubted Tesla's entry into China, but ISI wrote, \"Examining China's electric vehicle policy, it is difficult to foresee an OEM better placed than Tesla to assist the government in meeting its (clean fuel vehicle) goals.\"Tesla CEO Elon Musk had more to celebrate than a stock gain Tuesday, as his SpaceX space-exploration company shared a big government contract to take U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nApple went against the grain and dropped 0.8 percent to $100.86 after the Subway food chain announced the impending arrival of NFC charge terminals, which should boost the coming Apple Pay mobile payments service, which is already being attacked by eBay's PayPal; eBay gained 1.3 percent to $51.61.

(Mark Wilson / Getty Images)\n\nGoogle Inc., with its vision for a future where cars drive themselves, is putting itself at odds with an auto industry that shares its desire for safer, less-congested roads -- yet won't abide the \"driverless\" part.\n\nThe clash pits the Internet giant, public for barely a decade, against companies that spent a century building the machines that put people behind the wheel of autos. As Google works to perfect a system in research labs and road tests to minimize the involvement of drivers, automakers spend billions of dollars annually on ads to do the opposite. Think BMW and its claims to the Ultimate Driving Machine, or Volkswagen and its Drivers Wanted sales pitch.\n\nThe differences are more than philosophical.\n\nGoogle is sweeping up top talent and research, powered by an almost $400 billion stock-market value that tops those of Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. combined. It's also keeping a tight grip on its mapping data and potential marketing plans for cars while helping to create what many in the auto industry consider unrealistic expectations for how quickly cars can safely become wholly driverless.\n\n\"Clearly there's some sort of tension there,\" said Richard Wallace, director of transportation systems analysis at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Google's splashy displays of technology \"lead to expectations creep that's probably unrealistic in some ways,\" he said.\n\nGoogle's aloofness was on display at last week's Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit. The search giant had minimal presence at the annual event where automakers hash out standards for the technology that would keep, at the center of it all, the driver.\n\nAmong the advancements automakers announced at last week's conference in Detroit was GM's \"Super Cruise\" system for 2017 Cadillacs, which will let drivers take their hands off the steering wheel and feet from pedals for periods of highway driving. Like technology being developed by Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and other companies, GM's system hands control back and forth between driver and vehicle.\n\nThe approach that Google is taking is, literally, much more hands-off. In May it unveiled plans to deploy at least 100 fully autonomous, two-seat, egg-shaped test cars with a top speed of 25 miles per hour and no steering wheel. Google has since said it will include one, as well as brake and gas pedals, as California requires.\n\nAided by early staffing with top Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University scientists who won a U.S.-backed driverless vehicle challenge in 2005, Google recruited dozens of robotics and artificial-intelligence researchers, and is adding more.\n\nGoogle has won or applied for 96 autonomous-driving patents since 2011 and has hired talent from Toyota, BMW AG, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and even Silicon Valley upstart Tesla Motors Inc., according to LinkedIn profiles. For high-level advice, Google can turn to former Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally, now a board member.\n\nIt's also backed by more than $60 billion in cash, more than any individual automaker can muster.\n\n\"When you're at Google's scale you do plenty of things that disrupt or change the environment,\" said Frank Gillett, analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"We now have a race for who's going to build the software and services platform that operates driverless cars.\"\n\nWhile the effort is still in an early phase, executives including co-founder Sergey Brin have committed Google to making driverless cars a reality. They tout societal benefits of robotic cars, such as a transportation option for the blind and elderly.\n\nTo traditional manufacturers, anything that makes human drivers superfluous is automotive heresy.\n\n\"Driving is essentially very fun,\" Ken Koibuchi, general manager of intelligent vehicle development for Toyota, said in an interview in Detroit this month. For that and reasons including liability issues in the case of an accident and yet-to-be-set regulations, the world's largest carmaker isn't planning a driverless car even as it adds automated features.\n\nNissan Motor Co., Mercedes and Tesla are among those that have said they'll add self-driving features by end of the decade. None has said how much it's spending to do that.\n\n\"They've kind of shamed the automakers into investing more money into this,\" said Egil Juliussen, research director for advanced driving systems for IHS Automotive.\n\nWhile Google's cash pile tops that of individual automakers, Toyota's $41 billion, Volkswagen's $44 billion and GM's $29 billion ensure they can fund advances.\n\nGoogle so far hasn't specified whether it will build and sell driverless cars; create a service using such vehicles; or supply its driverless technology to the auto industry.", "WASHINGTON: NASA selected Boeing and SpaceX on Tuesday (Sep 16) to build America's next spacecraft to carry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2017, opening the way to a new chapter in human spaceflight.\n\nNASA, which has been unable to send astronauts to space since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, awarded a total of US$6.8 billion to the two companies for their respective spacecraft.\n\n\"The total potential contract value is US$4.2 billion for Boeing and US$2.6 billion for SpaceX,\" NASA administrator Charles Bolden said. \"It was not an easy choice, but it is the best choice for NASA and the nation.\"\n\nThe agency has spent more than US$1.4 billion since 2010 to help private companies including SpaceX, Boeing and Sierra Nevada - which lost out on Tuesday - develop their own crew transport vehicles.\n\nWith the end of the 30-year space shuttle programme, the world's space powers have had to rely on Russia's Soyuz for transporting rocket scientists to the orbiting outpost, at a cost of US$70 million per seat.\n\n\"From day one, the (President Barack) Obama administration has made it clear that the greatest nation on Earth should not be dependent on other nations to get into space,\" Bolden said.\n\n\"Thanks to the leadership of President Obama and the hard work of our NASA and industry teams, today we are one step closer to launching our astronauts from US soil on American spacecraft and ending the nation's sole reliance on Russia by 2017.\"\n\nBoeing has received the largest amount of NASA funds - US$620.8 million not including Tuesday's award - to help build its commercial crew vehicle, according to NASA.\n\nBoeing's acorn-shaped space capsule is called the Crew Space Transportation-100, or CST-100 for short, and designed to carry up to seven passengers or a mix of crew and cargo to the space station, which circles the planet in low-Earth orbit.\n\nThe sleek, metallic capsule is designed without welding creases, may be re-used up to 10 times, and is equipped with wireless Internet access and tablet technology so the crew can interface with mission control.\n\nCalifornia-based SpaceX has already been awarded US$554.5 million to develop its crew vehicle, which it has based on the Dragon cargo carrier it designed and which in 2010 became the first private spaceship to complete an unmanned resupply mission to the ISS.\n\nSpaceX is headed by Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, who made his fortune as co-founder of PayPal and also serves as CEO of Tesla Motors.\n\nMusk unveiled the Dragon Version Two, or V2, at a glitzy night-time news conference in May.

The need to assemble at least 1,000 acres -- the minimum eventually required by Tesla -- prompted local officials to create a partnership to share the risks and revenue.\n\nThey called the partnership \"Frame Switch\" after the historical community once rooted on the land.\n\nInitially, Tesla was looking for a 5 million-square-foot building it could convert, but that proved too difficult, so the company turned to building its own.\n\nIt pitted five states -- Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada and New Mexico -- in a bidding war that was by turns both very public and very secret.\n\nIn Texas, the code name was \"5 Star Project.\"\n\nDave Porter, senior vice president for economic development at the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, coordinated the regional response to Tesla.\n\nOn Nov. 5 of last year, Porter said, the governor's office relayed Tesla's desire for a large factory on 300 acres within an hour of the Austin, San Antonio or Dallas-Fort Worth airports.\n\nTexas had three days to respond.\n\nHutto didn't have an available 5 million-square-foot building, but Grisham said the community submitted a proposal to build on several hundred acres.\n\nOn Nov. 27, Porter said, he was alerted that Tesla was interested in the Hutto-Taylor site.\n\nOn Dec. 5, a couple of Tesla executives made the first of several visits to the Austin area with news that Tesla co-founder Elon Musk had enlarged the project to 1,000 acres.\n\nGrisham said he could get Taylor to help enlarge Hutto's original proposal of several hundred acres.\n\nAustin officials had been courting Tesla for four years.\n\n\"Our eyes went wide open,\" Porter said of the initial meeting.\n\nThere was a dinner in a private room at the III Forks restaurant and an all-day meeting at the Temple College campus in Hutto the next day.\n\nEvery time Tesla officials returned to Central Texas, they brought more executives, but Musk wasn't among them.\n\nBy March, Tesla had hired Austin lawyer David Armbrust, who has been involved in some of the region's largest development deals. Armbrust said his client assured him the company was serious about Hutto-Taylor.\n\n\"They told me they were looking at other sites in Texas, but they had not committed the resources like they had for Hutto-Taylor,\" Armbrust said.\n\nFor weeks, Armbrust said, he was on 10 a.m. conference calls with Tesla officials.\n\nDespite Tesla's urgency to investigate the Central Texas site, the company never officially filed applications for school district property tax breaks, commonly called Chapter 313 agreements, or for the Texas Enterprise Fund, the state's source for grants to relocating companies.\n\n\"I know they were frustrated with the state process,\" Porter said.\n\nHe said the application for Chapter 313 is voluminous, takes too long and makes the company's plans public the moment the paperwork is filed. Other states didn't have that hurdle, he said.\n\nAt the local level, the story was different.\n\n\"All the jurisdictional issues just faded away,\" Armbrust said. \"The attitude was, 'There is one site here. We're going to make it work.' It was incredible.\"\n\nTime was running out, however.\n\nOn July 31, Musk was due to talk to analysts during a quarterly earnings call. Porter said he and Grisham were meeting with company officials in Dallas just hours before Musk's pivotal conversation.\n\nNo one was sure what Musk was about to say, Porter said.\n\nDuring the call, Musk disclosed that the company had started clearing a site in Nevada, while insisting that Tesla would do the same at one or two other locations before finalizing a decision.\n\nThe real curveball: Musk said he expected the winning bidder to put up $500 million of the $5 billion price tag for the \"gigafactory.\"\n\nGrisham said Hutto-Taylor had put together a package of tax abatements and rebates worth $800 million to $900 million over 20 years. It had spent $20,000 for an option on the 1,200-plus acres.\n\nThe only upfront money would be whatever the state offered from the Texas Enterprise Fund.\n\n\"We knew no one was going to give $500 million upfront,\" Grisham said.\n\nNevada provided a $1.3 billion package, including tax breaks that will allow Tesla to operate the factory virtually tax-free for years.\n\n\"I don't view it as a loss because look at the exposure we're going to get,\" Grisham said. \"This is the biggest project talked about in the world.\"\n\nHe said the Hutto-Taylor partnership is trying to extend the options on the land and is approaching investors to buy the land -- at a cost of $20 million -- to keep the mega-site together for a game-changing project.\n\n\"If another project comes along,\" Stockard said, \"we can literally pick right up where we left off.\"", "If any state should know about bad bets, it's the gambling mecca Nevada. But it rolled the dice and came up snake eyes when it won the five-state bidding war Tesla Motors (TSLA) conducted for its new $5 billion battery factory. In beating out Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and Tesla's home state, California, Nevada is giving away the take.\n\nNot only is Nevada giving out more than double Tesla's initial demand for subsidies, from $500 million to $1.29 billion, but the Tesla project only has to create 6,000 jobs, not the initial 6,500 touted (see here: http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/28th2014Special/BDR/BDRSS28_32-0014.pdf). And Tesla itself doesn't have to hit the 6,000 jobs benchmark to get the tax breaks, instead, the hiring could be done by outside suppliers to the factory, says the watchdog group Good Jobs First, which keeps tabs on corporate breaks. Good Jobs First blasted Nevada's tax deal with Tesla Motors after reading the fine print, dubbing one provision \"a scheme we have never seen before.\"\n\nGreg LeRoy, who runs the watchdog group and is the author of the book \"The Great American Jobs Scam,\" says Tesla's $1.29 billion tax package ranks as the largest in Nevada history and the 12th largest in U.S. history.\n\nNevada politicians and Tesla have used job creation as a selling point for the massive subsidies. Nevada had the worst jobless rate during the recession, so excitement over Tesla's new battery factory, which it needs for its electric cars, has been running high. Tesla's \"gigafactory will mean nearly $100 billion in economic impact over the next 20 years,\" Governor Brian Sandoval has said.\n\nBut after studying the deal, economist Richard Florida has concluded \"3,000 permanent positions are more likely, and estimates the total job creation impact at 9,750 - less than half of the 22,000 claimed\" in overall job growth by Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development.\n\nTesla got a lot of vigorish in the form of exemptions from sales and property taxes, as well as tax credits and electricity discounts, which means locals will see their electric bills go up while the electric car maker operates \"completely tax-free in the state for the next ten years,\" says LeRoy. The Las Vegas Sun also reported LeRoy's analysis. Some $3.5 billion in capital investment has to be paid over the next decade to trigger all but one of the tax breaks.\n\nHowever, LeRoy says that $3.5 billion sum includes both Tesla's capital expenditures (the so-called 'lead participant' as state documents describe it) as well as what its suppliers will spend ('participants').\n\nMoreover, Good Jobs First's LeRoy says in \"a scheme we have never seen before, Tesla, the 'lead participant,' is entitled to all of the refundable tax credits (up to $195 million) even if the hiring that's needed to get those credits is done by the other 'participant' suppliers.\" He also says the deal requires just half of the \"temporary construction workforce and half of the permanent manufacturing workforce\" be Nevada residents.\" Which means the workers could come from nearby states like California, which won't have to spend any money to get those jobs.\n\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval's office gave this statement in response: \"The 6,500 jobs number is a projection based on several unbiased reports,\" adding, \"if a company does not create jobs, they do not receive the tax credit. The Nevada Legislature conducted a comprehensive and thorough review of this legislation.

That makes you CEO, manager, head honcho, the leader, right?!\n\nNot necessarily. Being in charge is one thing - being a true leader is something entirely different.\n\nTo become a great leader, you must have certain qualities that motivate others to follow. In fact, we believe there are six qualities that do a great job of accomplishing just that.\n\nDon't worry - everyone possesses these characteristics, but some may have to dig a little deeper to bring them out. Just take a look at these six qualities of great leaders, and some of the best influencers who embody them, to enhance your leadership development.\n\n1. They're Enthusiastic\n\nInspiring others to care about a topic, industry, or even a product demands a bit of enthusiasm. It takes more than being passionate about your company, you have to show it as well. Others will then feed off of this positive energy to incorporate it into their own behavior.\n\nJust think about Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube. Sister-in-law of Sergey Brin, founder of Google, Wojcicki displayed her enthusiasm for Google by hosting the search engine in her garage when it first began, and rising from there. First, she led AdWords and AdSense, but was called \"the most important Googler you've never heard of (Mercury News).\" She persevered and expressed her passion to lead in taking over YouTube in February of 2014; and nabbed the #12 spot on Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women list this year.\n\n(Image Source : Twitter)\n\n2. They're Communicative\n\nHow are you able to explain the importance of your company, if you aren't able to do it eloquently? Whether it is through a networking event or a simple email to a co-worker, communication is everything. A Forbes article unveiled 10 Communication Secrets of Great Leaders which could help you understand how to hone in these skills. A few highlights from the article include having an open mind, and learning to simply \"shut-up and listen;\" both of which can be helpful in handling a dispute or just conducting a brainstorm.\n\nDon't get discouraged if you find this characteristic difficult to master. Most world leaders struggle with this skill every day. In fact, the Dalai Lama is often brought in to encourage conversation about education instead of violence in order to prove a point among communication-challenged leaders. He does so with a contagious charisma often displayed on his Twitter page.\n\n(Image Source: TibetanReview.Net)\n\n3. They're Inquisitive\n\nCuriosity is a characteristic often defined by constantly asking questions. And a great leader must know when it is appropriate to give a straight-forward answer or when to answer with a question. This is a tricky trait, because the method is only effective when it is the right question. Daring to push co-workers (or fellow leaders) further by asking questions to provoke otherwise unknown answers could be the ticket to innovation.\n\nElon Musk is a perfect example of such a leader. He constantly pushes the limits by asking questions about current technological capabilities to discover solutions to unrealized questions. Just read up on creations such as Tesla Motors and SpaceX if you need specific examples.\n\n(Image Source: DazeInfo)\n\n4. They're Decisive\n\nYou must earn the right to call yourself a leader. The most powerful way to do so is through your decision-making skills. Knowing your goals, understanding the consequences, and deciding confidently are the ingredients in making a solid decision.\n\nTake a cue from leaders such as Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, for inspiration in swift decisiveness. In a recent article in The Guardian, Branson touches on how every decision he makes is with the brand in mind. Generally, Branson as a leader teaches you that if you want your name to be synonymous with your product or idea, you must be meticulously mindful in your decisions.\n\n(Image Source: Forbes)\n\n5. They're Ethical\n\nHaving the power of decisions is exciting, but all the while daunting. Since we don't live in a perfect world, and there are many temptations to take \"the easy way,\" you must harness the qualities of a true leader. You must rely on using your morality meter to make the hard, but ethical, decision and do what is right for the whole of a company or group, not just you.\n\nThe most impactful leader who exhibits this characteristic is Malala Yousafzai. At just 16 years old, she realizes the difference between right and wrong, and does not hesitate to stand for the justice of the whole. At 11 years old, she stood up to the Taliban, and since then has unfailingly defended women's right to an education. She is a brave example of using ethical means to be a leader.\n\n(Image Source: Lakeside Connect)\n\n6. They're Committed\n\nIn the end, you must be completely, totally, utterly, and 100% committed to your goals for your venture. If you don't believe in what you want to achieve, nobody else will either. No matter the difficulties you face, or the hardships you must overcome, you have to show a dedication to succeeding.\n\nJeff Bezos of Amazon is exemplary at showing such a quality. He had a clear goal in pioneering internet commerce, and has changed to stay competitive with innovation only if it does not conflict with his branding goals. It was only a month ago that Amazon updated their login screen after more than a decade of what Bezos believed to have worked. So be sure to choose your goals carefully, because the best leaders stick to them!\n\n(Image Source: Fast Company)\n\nWhat other qualities do great leaders possess?

Porter said he and Grisham were meeting with company officials in Dallas just hours before Musk's pivotal conversation.\n\nNo one was sure what Musk was about to say, Porter said.\n\nDuring the call, Musk disclosed that the company had started clearing a site in Nevada, while insisting that Tesla would do the same at one or two other locations before finalizing a decision.\n\nThe real curveball: Musk said he expected the winning bidder to put up $500 million of the $5 billion price tag for the \"gigafactory.\"\n\nGrisham said Hutto-Taylor had put together a package of tax abatements and rebates worth $800 million to $900 million over 20 years. It had spent $20,000 for an option on the 1,200-plus acres.\n\nThe only upfront money would be whatever the state offered from the Texas Enterprise Fund.\n\n\"We knew no one was going to give $500 million upfront,\" Grisham said.\n\nNevada provided a $1.3 billion package, including tax breaks that will allow Tesla to operate the factory virtually tax-free for years.\n\n\"I don't view it as a loss because look at the exposure we're going to get,\" Grisham said. \"This is the biggest project talked about in the world.\"\n\nHe said the Hutto-Taylor partnership is trying to extend the options on the land and is approaching investors to buy the land -- at a cost of $20 million -- to keep the mega-site together for a game-changing project.\n\n\"If another project comes along,\" Stockard said, \"we can literally pick right up where we left off.\"\n\n---\n\nInformation from: Austin American-Statesman, http://www.statesman.com\n\nThis is an AP Member Exchange shared by the Austin American-Statesman", "Analysts at RBC Capital Markets assumed Microsoft (MSFT) with an 'Outperform' from 'Sector Perform' rating and raised their price target to $54.00 in a research report issued to clients on Tuesday.

US Silicon Valley venture capital funds already refer to Africa as the Silicon Savannah.\n\nDerek Kudsee, chief operating officer for the African arm of tech firm SAP, says the company has invested in and set up an innovation centre in Pretoria to foster innovation with an African flavour.\n\n\"Mobile innovation is a particular focus for us,\" he says. \"Africa has the world's fastest-growing population and mobile innovation will drive African economies in future. Bear in mind that 90% of the continent's gross domestic product is generated by small- to medium-sized companies and virtually all of them rely heavily on mobile technology.\n\n\"There are about 800 million cellphone users in Africa which is about three times the population of the US. Since 2011, 150 million people in Africa have found themselves living within less than a 2km radius of a fibre optic node.\n\n\"We see innovation in Africa happening at an accelerated pace now because the continent is so well served by internet connections - 16 submarine cables link Africa with the rest of the world. The lines make 25TB of data per second available but less than 1TB is used - there's huge room for growth.\n\n\"Innovation is most likely to take place around renewable energy and natural resources and there will be huge investment in mobile banking as smartphones will be used for transactions instead of ATMs,\" he says.\n\nPerhaps the current poster boy for a South African with innovation in his blood is Pretoria-born and high school-educated Elon Musk. The serial entrepreneur, engineer and inventor has established three companies, all with innovation at their core. In 2002 he sold PayPal, an online payment system, to auction site eBay for US$1.5-billion. The same year he founded SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies) with some of the PayPal proceeds. It's a company that develops and builds space launch vehicles and has effectively made the case for the privatisation and commercialisation of space exploration in the US. Musk has said he wants to send humans to Mars in the next two decades. Here on planet Earth, Musk is chief executive of Tesla Motors, which is doing pioneering work in the field of electric cars, and he co-founded SolarCity, the largest provider of solar power systems in the US.\n\nWhile Musk's endeavours have an international and even interplanetary focus, innovation for Africa and beyond is a core focus at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Pretoria. It's an organisation that supports innovation in South Africa with a view to improving national and international competitiveness in the fields of science and technology. Says Richard Fearon, the CSIR's entrepreneur-in-residence: \"South African innovators face significant challenges -- key among them access to capital and access to markets. But all of this is underscored by problems with the country's education system, particularly in the areas of maths and science.\"\n\nFearon says innovation could help turn things around in education. \"We're seeing huge strides in mobile technology that delivers great educators to the masses via the internet. There's a great deal of innovation that takes place in South Africa. One of our recent locally developed projects that's about to be licensed internationally looks at cells in a patient and then quickly determines which treatment is the most appropriate for them -- it's personalised medicine. Another is a project with a working title of CellNostics. Using mobile technology, we've developed a portable device and platform that can take a small blood sample from a patient, upload its composition to the cloud for pathology diagnostics and then return results almost immediately. It can quickly screen for conditions like HIV, diabetes, malaria and tuberculosis, for example, and plugs into existing computerised health systems. Initiatives like this will pave the way for improved national health facilities that will work, given that there are too few doctors serving too many people. The cost and speed of the new system makes healthcare more affordable and the commercial research possibilities, particularly for pharmaceutical companies, means that they would get involved in funding it. \"\n\n\"South Africa is a great country for research and development because you can attach a rand overhead to innovation that will usually produce earnings in euros and dollars. We have the skills, minds and infrastructure to do great work but we do try to balance profit with purpose,\" he says.\n\nFearon says future innovation will be driven by finding African solutions to African challenges and that much of it will incorporate mobile technology as the most ubiquitous and powerful method of reaching people and communities.", "(Reuters) - Massachusetts' highest court on Monday threw out a lawsuit seeking to block Tesla Motors Inc\n\nThe state's Supreme Judicial Court unanimously concluded that the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association and two dealers lacked standing to block direct Tesla sales under a state law designed to protect franchise owners from abuses by car manufacturers.\n\nJustice Margot Botsford wrote that the law was aimed at protecting dealers from unfair practices of manufacturers and distributors \"with which they are associated, generally in a franchise relationship,\" rather than unaffiliated manufacturers.\n\nThe law \"was intended and understood only to prohibit manufacturer-owned dealerships when, unlike Tesla, the manufacturer already had an affiliated dealer or dealers in Massachusetts,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Contrary to the plaintiffs' assertion,\" she added, \"the type of competitive injury they describe between unaffiliated entities is not within the statute's area of concern.\"\n\nThe trade group had accused Tesla of operating a showroom in Natick, Massachusetts without a license and in violation of a law prohibiting a manufacturer from owning a dealership.\n\nNeither the trade group nor its lawyer immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\n\"It's a great decision,\" Todd Maron, deputy general counsel at Tesla, said in a telephone interview.\n\n\"The statute is very similar to statutes in other states,\" he said. \"We have battles in New Jersey and other states with similar constructs, and we hope and expect the same interpretation would carry over to those venues.\"\n\nIn March, New Jersey's Motor Vehicle Commission effectively revoked Tesla's license to operate two stores. The General Assembly in June passed legislation that would, if enacted into law, allow sales to resume.\n\nTesla also cannot conduct direct sales in Arizona, Maryland and Texas, the company said.\n\nLast week, Nevada let Tesla make direct car sales to residents, as part of an arrangement to provide $1.3 billion of tax breaks for the company to build a giant battery factory.\n\nIn an unusual blog posting in April, three top U.S. Federal Trade Commission officials expressed opposition to laws banning direct sales, saying they could harm consumers.

Tesla Motors MA Inc, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, No. SJC-11545.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "It takes only a few seconds for anyone to notice that USC is a very busy place. To newly admitted freshmen, the hustle and bustle of Trousdale Parkway at 10 a.m. is frightening and chaotic at the very least. In an urban campus teeming with movement, activity and distracted students, efficient transportation is unfortunately lacking. That's where GenZe, a startup conceived in Silicon Valley, comes in. The company seeks to remedy ineffective transport issues with its line of effective and eco-friendly electric scooters.\n\nThe concept behind GenZe was developed when the company toured university campuses across the country in an effort to examine and analyze the daily routine of college students. What they found was that students weren't using transport for any single purpose, instead using them for a variety of things. Furthermore, many were unsatisfied with the existing modes of transport and desired more from their vehicles.\n\n\"Students would have to wait for a campus bus in the snow, rain or hot sun. If they were taking a bicycle, there wouldn't be enough space for their laptop, backpack or groceries,\" said Yesim Erez, head of marketing and development for GenZe. \"Furthermore, universities like USC are making it increasingly difficult for students to own cars because it's very expensive to park, gas prices are high and students can't always afford to pay for repairs.\"\n\nWith such problems in mind, GenZe has created two products that combine practical functionality with striking aesthetics and innovation. The GenZe 2.0 is an electric scooter that provides substantial storage capacity and creates a hassle-free transport experience. Powered by a rechargeable battery module, the vehicle is complete with an electronics charging port and a 7-inch touch-screen monitor that syncs with smartphone applications and indicates important vehicular diagnostics such as speed and charge state.\n\nIts counterpart is the GenZe e-Bike, a modern twist on the traditional bicycle. Its distinct feature is its throttle, which can propel the bike without any human exertion. Also powered by a lightweight battery pack, the e-Bike is extremely versatile, coming in the form of both sports and recreational models.\n\nFor any company centered on a product, one of the most important elements of its success is the nature of consumers' response. Naturally for GenZe, the feedback has been tremendous. Many students have already purchased the vehicles online, and the company is preparing to exhibit its products on various university campuses on the West Coast, including USC, UC Davis and UCLA.\n\nGenZe's successful and innovative products cannot be viewed in isolation, however, as the people and work behind the company also distinguishes GenZe from similar businesses. Genze has an immense talent pool -- many of its engineers have previously worked at Tesla Motors and Mercedes-Benz. Furthermore, the GenZe team is diverse, as all designers have had extensive experience producing consumer products. According to the company, even in vehicle production, understanding consumers and their nuanced tastes is essential to success.\n\n\"We carefully studied what students define as cool, and we came to learn that they have an affinity for minimalism,\" Erez said. \"Look at our scooter, for example. Many people like scooters but don't think they look cool. Thus, we made the seat so that you can sit on it or put it on a slant and lean on it like a barstool.\"\n\nDespite its current success among university students, GenZe is looking to continuously improve its products and business model. The company currently delivers products to California, Oregon and Michigan, a limitation that it hopes to soon overcome. In the next year, GenZe plans to expand across the country. By doing this, the company can sell their products directly to students and be conveniently located to provide more services to them. Furthermore, GenZe is also looking to expand its portfolio of electric vehicles in order to better serve the transportation needs of students and urban commuters.\n\nGenZe's vision keeps its engine going. The company hopes that their products will allow students to utilize its own skills and talents to create the next generation of ingenious products that create a positive difference in someone else's world. \"Always start with the end in mind and always try to think of a solution that no one else is thinking of,\" Erez said. \"You always want to create a unique product that has a value-added difference.\n\nThe GenZe does what a bicycle, skateboard and even a car cannot. It fills a void and a need that no other product can in the same way.\" For students curious about GenZe's products, the company will be exhibiting the GenZe 2.0 and the e-Bikes outside the Lyon Center on Sept. 16 and 17.", "An Ann Arbor-based start-up said it has developed lithium-ion battery technology that is nearly twice as efficient as batteries in Tesla Motors' Model S.\n\nSakti3, a University of Michigan spinoff that has raised $30 million in venture capital, said its new battery cell also has \"more than double the usage time in a wearable device like a smartwatch.\"\n\nThe company, whose investors include General Motors and Khosla Ventures, said its battery technology would increase the range of a Model S from 256 to 480 miles.\n\n\"We don't believe there's anything outlandish about these projections at all,\" Sakti3 CEO Ann Marie Sastry said in an interview.\n\nSastry, a former U-M engineering professor, said the technology would be for sale within two years. Sakti3 intends to target wearable electronics before selling to automakers.\n\nSakti3 will partner with an unidentified manufacturer instead of investing in its own factory.\n\n\"This is not a case where it's an extremely expensive and hard-to-manage process,\" she said.\n\nImproving the energy density of batteries and lowering their cost is crucial in making electric cars more affordable.", "Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, is planning to build its giant battery Gigafactory in Nevada after a five-state competition, a source who asked not to be identified confirms.\n\nNevada Gov. Brian Sandoval has called a news conference Thursday in Nevada's capitol, Carson City, where the deal is expected to be announced.\n\nThe plant has been one of the nation's most highly sought projects among state economic development officials. Tesla, which has partnered with Japan's Panasonic, plans to spend $4 billion-$5 billion on the project and employ up to 6,500. The plant will make advanced batteries expected to power Tesla's next generation of electric cars.\n\nTesla recently confirmed that it has been excavating on a site near Reno, but stopped short of saying that it would be the site of the giant plant. In choosing Nevada, Tesla picks a location only a few hundred miles from its main assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which is close to its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto.\n\nThe announcement comes after a weekend in which California's legislature adjourned without acting on a bill that could have delivered economic incentives to try to lure Tesla into building its battery plant in the Golden State.\n\nBesides Nevada and California, other states named as finalists for the project included Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Tesla has indicated it may build a second battery factory, too.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said that the company needs the Gigafactory, as he calls it, to dramatically lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries. The maker has indicated it was on a tight schedule to make sure the plant is running in time for start of production of its third model, the Model III, which would be aimed at mass-market car buyers.\n\nTesla now makes only a single electric car model, the Model S, and is about to start production of an electric crossover, the Model X. Both of those vehicles, however, are aimed at high-end luxury buyers.\n\nTesla had no official comment today on the pending announcement. Spokesman Simon Sproule said, \"We continue to work with the state of Nevada.\"", "There are two ways to look at Lance Gilman of Storey County, Nev., the businessman whose industrial center is set to house Tesla's massive Gigafactory.\n\nTo some, he is a major player when it comes to economic development in Nevada, a state that is still clawing its way out of a recession. To others, Gilman is also seen as a flesh peddler -- he's owner of the famous Mustang Ranch brothel, legally operated in Storey County just east of Reno.\n\nGilman is the principal and director of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, billed as the largest industrial park in the world. As Storey County Manager Pat Whitten put it, Gilman is \"the lead economic engine for Northern Nevada.\"\n\nBesides Tesla, he's lured major companies to his park, which has become a cash cow of tiny Storey County. The park is located just outside the county limits of the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area and includes companies such as Kal-Kan, Wal-Mart, Dell Computers and Toys R Us. The industrial park is next to coast-to-coast interstate highway and rail systems, so it sells itself. Yet Gilman closes the deals.\n\nHe is also an integral part of the negotiations to bring Tesla Motors' $5 billion Gigifactory project to the industrial park he represents.\n\nMeanwhile, Gilman got into the brothel business about a decade ago with his Wild Horse Canyon Ranch brothel. He later bought the Mustang Ranch, which was previously owned by the notorious Joe Conforte -- who escaped to Brazil to avoid federal prosecution for tax evasion.\n\nWhen the Mustang re-opened under Gilman's ownership in 2007, Conforte appeared via live video feed at a grand opening celebration to give a few words and pass the mantle off to Gilman.\n\nWhen Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told the Nevada Legislature in 2011 it was time to ban legal prostitution in Nevada, he did not mention Gilman by name, but it was apparent who he was speaking about.\n\nAfter that speech, Gilman said he was the target of the majority leader's concerns over businesses not coming to Nevada because of brothels, but added those concerns were overstated.\n\n\"I just read the speech and I am mystified at that quote,\" Gilman said back in 2011. \"It made it appear he is on the attack on Storey County and TRI.\"\n\nGilman carries clout for another reason: he's one of three Storey County commissioners, although some residents in the county seat of Virginia City will tell you Gilman doesn't really live in the county.\n\nLast summer, a Storey County jury awarded a $1.3 million judgment to investor Tom Gonzales, who contended Gilman and the Storey County government conspired to bamboozle him out of his share as as secret partner in the Mustang brothel. After winning the the jury's verdict, Gonzales called for the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Gilman and the Storey County government.\n\nStorey County District Attorney Bill Maddox called that allegation \"b.s.,\" but also acknowledged Gilman's influence.\n\n\"In retrospect, we might have been manipulated,\" he said in an interview earlier this year. \"You could certainly conclude that from all that has happened, that the county might have been manipulated. If you want to quote me on that, go ahead. It'll probably get me in trouble with Gilman, but so be it.\"", "RENO, NEV. -- Gov. Brian Sandoval has ordered the Nevada Legislature into a special session to consider $1.3 billion in tax breaks and other incentives for electric car-maker Tesla Motors as part of \"an extraordinary opportunity\" to seal the deal for its $5 billion battery factory and tens of thousands of jobs he says are needed to recover from the worst economic crisis in state history.\n\nMajority Democrats in the Senate and Assembly intended to open the session today to begin work on the package the Republican governor says would help further diversify Nevada's hard-hit, tourism-based economy through new and innovative technology.\n\n\"An extraordinary occasion exists, which requires immediate action of the Legislature,\" Sandoval wrote in the formal proclamation signed late Tuesday night. He said Nevada continues to \"feel the effects\" of the Great Recession -- \"the worst economic crisis in the history of the state.\"\n\nSandoval said the lithium battery gigafactory and its 6,500 workers would generate more than 20,000 construction and other related jobs and up to $100 billion for Nevada's economy over the next 20 years -- a return on investment he estimated to be $80 for every $1 the state spends.\n\nLittle public opposition has emerged among lawmakers since Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced alongside Sandoval on the Capitol steps last week that Nevada had beat out California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico for the factory expected to open in 2017.\n\nSandoval's proclamation doesn't name Tesla, but covers the seven categories in the blueprint his Office of Economic Development outlined on Thursday when Musk said Nevada was the best fit for his venture critical to cutting costs for his next line of more affordable electric cars.\n\nLawmakers toured the expansive site at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center along U.S. Interstate 80 about 15 miles east of Sparks on Tuesday and Assembly Minority Leader Pat Hickey, R-Reno, said he was prepping for \"an all-nighter if necessary\" after late-night briefings scheduled with the governor's staff.\n\nThe special session was expected to begin Wednesday afternoon and could last days.\n\n\"How long it is going to take is anybody's guess,\" Hickey said.\n\nRalston Reports' Jon Ralston reported the proclamation was wasn't signed until just before midnight partly because other Nevada companies were making a last-ditch effort to secure a way to win sales tax breaks similar to those being offered to Tesla.\n\nEven before Sandoval signed the order, dozens of lobbyists had registered to represent more than 30 companies and organizations at the special session, including labor unions, chambers of commerce, school districts, auto dealers, health care organizations, utilities, manufacturing and other trade groups, and even Black Rock City LLC -- the organizers of the annual Burning Man counter-culture festival.\n\nDemocrats said one of their priorities would be to make sure the jobs go to Nevadans at prevailing wages. That shouldn't be a problem at the factory where Tesla says hourly pay will average $25 or more, but it could be a sticking point with some Republicans because of the estimated 3,000 construction jobs expected to be needed to build the plant.\n\nMari St. Martin, Sandoval's director of communications, did not respond to repeated telephone calls or emails seeking comment Tuesday night and early today.", "CARSON CITY, NEV. -- Nevada's Legislature resolved some issues, but disagreed on others as it debated a $1.25-billion incentive deal to bring Tesla Motors' battery Gigafactory to a site outside Reno.\n\nAs a result, lawmakers left Thursday without having voted on bills related to Tesla's $4-billion to $5-billion factory, which would create up to 6,500 jobs.\n\nOne of the strongest objections came from Senate Democrats to Gov. Brian Sandoval's plan to slice $70 million out of a movie-production tax abatement program passed in 2013 Legislature and shift it to the Tesla deal.\n\n\"That's a tough one for my caucus,\" said Sen. Debbie Smith, D-Sparks, and the chair of the Senate Finance Committee. \"A lot of time and effort was spent on it in the last legislative session, and it has only been in effect for nine months and we are already dialing it back? It does not send a very positive message to the film industry.\"\n\nNevada's franchised auto dealers agreed not to stand in the way of a plan to allow Tesla to sell its electric cars \"factory direct\" to Nevada consumers. Tesla does not sell its cars through franchised auto dealers. That was a major sticking point in negotiations with Texas and Arizona to locate the Gigafactory in those states, according to news reports. California and New Mexico also bid for the project.\n\n\"My car dealers want to assist in any way they can,\" said lobbyist John Sande of the Nevada Franchised Auto Dealers Association. \"Nevada law does not allow Tesla to come in and sell direct to the consumer, so we are going to have come in and change it so they can sell direct to the consumer.\"\n\nThe Nevada insurance industry won't object to a plan to strip it of about $27 million in tax breaks for companies that have offices in Nevada. Nevada insurance companies that have offices in Nevada have received the tax break since at least 1971, said longtime insurance lobbyist Jim Wadhams.\n\nNow, however, it appears that tax break will be eliminated and the $27 million it produces for the insurance industry will now become part of Tesla's tax abatement program.\n\n\"We think this is a great thing for Nevada to have the Gigafactory come in, jobs and the like,\" Wadhams said. \"But we would expect the Legislature at some point would revisit this issue.\"\n\nWadhams warned that insurance companies may shutter their Nevada offices if the tax break is lost. They could instead service Nevada accounts from out-of-state offices.\n\nAssemblyman Skip Daly, D-Sparks, also wants Tesla to adhere to a prevailing wage scale for construction workers who build the gigafactory. Daly and other Democrats want to make sure that Nevada workers are hired for construction and as employees of the Gigafactory.\n\nState law requires prevailing wage scales to be used in public works projects, but not usually in privately-funded projects.\n\nRepublicans are opposed to forcing Tesla to honor a prevailing-wage scale.\n\n\"This is a public-private partnership and no direct public dollars are going into the construction of the site,\" said Assembly Minority Leader Pat Hickey, R-Reno.", "* The September 2014 Empire State Manufacturing Survey indicates that business activity expanded at a robust pace for New York manufacturers.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it will be the largest lithium battery factory in the world, producing more batteries annually than all the existing plants in the world did in 2013.\n\nWhen and how many jobs will be produced?\n\nThe factory is projected to employ up to 6,500 workers by the time it's scheduled hit full production in 2018. In the meantime, the Governor's Office of Economic Development projects 3,000 construction jobs will be created, beginning with 700 in 2015. Another 1,000 direct jobs are forecast to be added in 2016 with an additional 3,000 by 2017. The state anticipates 22,000 jobs will be produced over 20 years as a result of the project.\n\nA banner welcoming Tesla to Nevada is hung on the US Bank building. Photo / AP\n\nWho will get the jobs?\n\nHalf of the 6,500 factory jobs and half the 3,000 construction jobs must be offered to Nevadans who have worked 30 hours a week the past year in a Nevada job covered by health insurance. The factory jobs are expected to average a minimum of $23 per hour. If Tesla cannot find enough qualified Nevada workers for specific jobs, it can appeal to the state for exceptions.\n\nWhat did Tesla receive in terms of economic incentives?\n\nThe total package over 20 years is estimated to be worth up to US$1.3 billion - up to $1.1 billion of that in the form of tax abatements that will see Tesla pay no property or payroll taxes for 10 years and no local sales or use taxes for 20 years. The other nearly $200 million is in the form of tax credits.\n\nRead also:\n\n* Tesla Motors dealing as states play factory poker\n\n* Gigafactory gets the go-ahead\n\nHow does this compare with other incentive packages offered nationally?\n\nThe incentives are 14 times larger than the largest Nevada has ever granted - $89 million for Apple to locate in Reno in 2012. According to Good Jobs First, it is the 13th largest giveaway in US history, rivaling the biggest ever offered to the auto industry - Chrysler's $1.3 billion from Michigan in 2010. The biggest ever went to Boeing in Washington, $8.7 billion.\n\nWhat's the return on Nevada's investment?\n\nThe governor projects a return of 80-to-1 based on an investment of up to $1.3 billion that he says will pump $100 billion into Nevada's economy over 20 years, although some economists argue the multiplier used to figure indirect investment is inflated.\n\nWhat assurances does Nevada have it will see all that money?\n\nTesla is required to invest a minimum of $3.5 billion in the state within 10 years. If it fails to do so, it will have to pay back the abatements with interest.\n\nWhy did Tesla pick Nevada over Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona?\n\nOfficials in Texas say they offered Tesla a bigger incentive package. Musk acknowledged Nevada's offer wasn't the largest, but insisted it wasn't all about the money. He said the cost of doing business was a key and that the single most important factor was a regulatory climate that allowed Tesla to move fastest in Nevada.", "The dollar weakened against most major peers and government bonds climbed before the Federal Reserve reviews interest rates.

I spent the first week of June visiting Saint-Clement des Baleines, France. Over the last week of August, I took in San Clemente, Italy.\n\nAs I might say in my hometown of San Clemente, I collect San Clementes. I've been to six. Others populate my bucket list.\n\nWHERE'S THE BEACH?\n\nUnlike its namesake in California, Italy's San Clemente is not a beach town - it's 5 miles inland from the Adriatic Sea. It isn't much of a stretch to call it \"Italian village by the Sea\" as a spinoff on \"Spanish Village by the Sea,\" Orange County's San Clemente.\n\nItaly's historic village sits atop a knoll surrounded by fortress walls that command a view of the sea. Where the downtown street in San Clemente, Calif., is Avenida Del Mar (Avenue of the Sea), San Clemente, Italy, invites you to stroll its Via del Castello, a reference to its castle-like walls.\n\nWalls were common in medieval times. On a tourist map of Rimini Province, walled villages dot the landscape. San Clemente evidently avoided warfare and enjoyed a peaceful evolution under domain of the Malatesta family, the rule of Venice, rule of the Vatican, a Napoleonic period and the the rule of Italy after national unification, townspeople told me.\n\nSEEING THE LIGHT\n\nIn France, Saint-Clement des Baleines (San Clemente of the Whales) is surrounded on two sides by water. It's the southwest corner of an island, Ile de Re, that draws throngs of summer tourists. A top attraction is San Clemente's Phare des Baleines lighthouse, completed in 1854 to replace a shorter one that dates to 1682 and still stands. A spiral staircase of 257 steps ascends to the top of the big one, 187 feet up.\n\nThe pleasant island is flat, populated by villages, vacation rentals and campgrounds. Bicycle trails lead past vineyards, salt flats, beaches and a nature reserve.\n\nI reached the lighthouse on foot from downtown. There's no San Clemente Pier, no lifeguard headquarters with clock tower along this beach trail as in California. The lighthouse is the landmark. Just as San Clemente's beach trail is perched atop railroad rocks, Saint-Clement's sits atop ramparts protecting it from the \"Savage Coast.\"\n\nOn the day I walked it, the \"savage\" coastal waters of the Atlantic were on their best behavior - placid, gorgeously blue-green and deliciously warm.\n\nHOW I FOUND THEM\n\nCalifornia's San Clemente's sister city, San Clemente del Tuyu, Argentina, inspired my search. It's a fun beach town with a fishing pier, surf, fishing tournaments, hot springs, a historic lighthouse, packed beaches and festive summer evenings. It's home to Mundo Marino, South America's Sea World.\n\nIt took me five months to reach the Argentine sister city on my first visit in 1974. I traveled over land across Central and South America. During a month exploring Ecuador, I surmised Ecuador might have a San Clemente, so I asked.\n\nThe dot on the map in the Quito tourist office didn't prove easy to reach. A dusty ride in an open-air bus got me there, rewarding me with a sleepy beach town that so entranced me, I revisited it in 2012. Oh, and I've revisited my town's charming Argentine sister city four times.\n\nOn a 1976 Eurailpass fling across Europe, I inquired in Madrid and found San Clemente, Spain. It was an easy bus ride. A local family, the Peramos, showed me around this village that dates to around 1100 and has splendid architecture from the 1400s and 1500s. I revisited in January 2014. I had hoped to surprise Dr. Braulio Peramo, a San Clemente native, only to learn he was out of the country.\n\nOn the 1976 trip, I also found San Clemente, Italy. Saint-Clement des Baleines came to me during a recent Web search that produced a dizzying number of Saint-Clements in France. I picked the one that had a beach.\n\nSan Clemente, Mexico, is two to three hours outside Guadalajara by bus, discovered via Web search. As I later wrote, it's a delightful town with colonial roots and a landmark hacienda said to date back 400 years.\n\nFun facts, Italy\n\nLoving wine: San Clemente, Rimini, has a music and wine festival the third Sunday of July, coinciding with our San Clemente's yearly ocean festival. Actually, the Note di Vino festival runs three successive Sundays.\n\nFavorite son: Giustiniano Villa, social poet (1842-1919), is San Clemente's favorite son, celebrated with a monument and displays several of his literary works. One is about Italian migration to America.\n\nPopulation: About 500 in and around the historic walls. The outlying village has spread out, resulting in an overall population of 5,000.\n\nTraffic signals: I saw one. The main road is so narrow, summiting the hill, that traffic must stop on one side to let the other side pass.\n\nIndustries: Wine, olive oil, ceramic tiles\n\nTaste of SC: Locals are proud that Gino Angelini, a native of San Clemente and award-winning chef, has a Los Angeles restaurant, Angelini Osteria. You needn't fly to Rome for a taste of the town.\n\nAmbiance: Downtown Saint-Clement des Baleines remains one of the most quiet, laid-back villages on Ile de Re, despite swarms of tourists who visit the town's outlying lighthouse, maritime museum and collection of souvenir shops and restaurants.\n\nPopulation: About 700 core residents, though the population swells as summer vacation rentals, inns and campgrounds fill.\n\nPresidential: Just as President Richard Nixon hosted world leaders in San Clemente, Calif., in the 1970s, Saint-Clement hosted French President Francois Mitterand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1992. During a summit, they dined at Saint-Clement's esteemed downtown restaurant, Le Chat Botte.\n\nMovie scene: Ile de Re was occupied by German forces during World War II. One of Saint-Clement's beaches, La Conche, served as a movie set for the 1960s D-Day movie \"The Longest Day.\"\n\nLoving wine: Ile de Re has its own local wines, Vignerons de Ile de Re, and homegrown beers, Biere de Re.\n\nSource: Locals, tourist office, observations, souvenir book by Herve Roques", "\"After so many miles, you have to bring it in for an oil change or tune-up,\" said Kimberly Gardner, plant leader at Propoulsion Technologies International of Miramar. \"After so many hours running an [aircraft] engine, you basically have to service the engine.\"\n\nThat work is creating double-digit growth at Propulsion Technologies, which repairs parts for one aircraft engine line for General Electric Aviation and France-based Snecma. The engine, the CFM56, powers Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft.\n\nPropulsion Technologies will be recognized this week as one of the South Florida Manufacturing Association's 2014 Manufacturers of the Year. The others are Hotpie in Fort Pierce, PAC Seating Systems in Palm City and Techno Coatings in Miami.\n\nPropulsion Technologies' revenues grew 28 percent in 2012 and 22 percent last year, said Gardner, who joined Propulsion Technologies in 2012 after a long career at GE in Hartford, Conn.\n\nThe company increased staff by 6 percent in 2013 and will more than double that growth this year, she said. The Miramar company employs 153 people and is hiring for manual machinists, process engineers and quality engineers.\n\nGardner is working with Snecma partner Thomas Grosclaude to launch a program at Broward College to generate local workers with the skills they need.\n\n\"They're not just employing people at high-level jobs; they're investing in our community,\" June Wolfe, president of the South Florida Manufacturers Association, said of Propulsion Technologies' move from Doral to Miramar in 2011.\n\nGardner said leadership principles she learned at GE have served her well. At Propulsion Technologies, she manages autonomous teams, rather than layers of management.\n\n\"The team makes decisions based on the customers' needs,\" she said.\n\nEmployees also attend team-building events at Broward College's Tigertail adventure learning program.\n\nNorm Seavers, associate vice president at the college's Institute for Economic Development, said Tigertail is designed to help organizations improve communications, resolve conflict or address other issues.\n\nmpounds@sunsentinel.com or 561-243-6650\n\nEVENT: \"State of the Art Thinking,\" with keynote by management consultant Mike Adams and a panel discussion with the award-winning manufacturers", "This is Kongsberg Norspace's first commercial order for the new generation frequency agile Command Receiver that can be commanded in-orbit to operate over a wide frequency range. In addition to the frequency agility, the new Command Receiver offers significant performance improvements over the first generation product, which Kongsberg Norspace has manufactured and sold under a license since 2006, the company writes. The Intellectual Property of the new product is fully owned by Kongsberg Norspace.\n\nThe order comes less than two years after Kongsberg Norspace started the development of the new generation Command Receiver under an ARTES contract with the European Space Agency (ESA). Kongsberg Norspace is already building flight units using the new generation design, but without the frequency agility, for another customer. These units will operate at Ka-band (28 GHz), while the SES-10 units will operate at Ku-band (14 GHz).\n\nCommenting on the contract award, Kongsberg Norspace's CEO Sverre Bisgaard said, \"We are very pleased and proud of the trust Airbus and SES - two of the most prominent actors in the commercial satellite industry - have shown us by placing this order. The ongoing development and qualification, and the ongoing manufacturing of flight units, which are progressing as planned, have probably been major contributors to win this contract. It shows our customers that we do what we say. Moreover, honestly, the interest the new product has received in the market has almost overwhelmed us. The features offered by the new product seems to be a timely response to new needs from satellite operators.\"", "One of the strangest-looking yet important planes ever created has reached its 20th birthday \u00e2\u0080\" the Airbus \"Beluga\" transport plane. The Beluga is a highly modified Airbus A300, and named for its resemblance to the Beluga Whale. Airbus has marked the occasion with a video about the plane.\n\nIn its early days, Airbus used modified and obsolete 1940s-vintage transport planes which were built by its biggest competitor, Boeing. That had to be a little bit embarrassing. Boeing even joked that \"every Airbus is delivered on the wings of a Boeing.\" The modified Boeing Stratocruisers were nicknamed \"Super Guppies.\" Super Guppies were also used by NASA to ferry rocket parts to their final assembly prior to launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nOfficially named the Airbus A300-600ST, (the ST for Super Transporter) this workhorse aircraft is second only to the Antonov An-225 in terms of cargo capacity by volume. Its lifting capability is only 47 tons, however. Its mission is to carry aircraft components, such as completed fuselage sections and wings from Airbus factories around Europe to final assembly factories in Toulouse and Hamburg. Five Belugas are flying for Airbus. Their size limits them from transporting pieces of the A380, which is the world's largest passenger jet. However, Flight Global says Airbus may be evaluating an A330 version of the Beluga, based on manufacturing schematics for a new Beluga line station (mentioned in the video above).\n\nBoeing has its own modified beast-of-burden aircraft, the 747-LCF (Large Cargo Freighter) also known as the Dreamlifter. Boeing's fleet of four modified 747-400s were built specifically to transport 787 Dreamliner (see what they did there?) sections. Development and manufacturing of the Dreamliner is a truly global initiative for Boeing, one that some would say led to the program's delays. But regardless, it's remarkable that manufacturers can modify planes to meet their own needs. These planes may not be aerodynamically efficient, but they get the job done a lot faster than having to ship plane pieces over land or sea.", "(Reuters) - European travellers face continued disruption as Air France\n\nAir France said it had been forced to cancel six out of 10 flights on Monday and predicted the same level of groundings the next day.\n\nAir France pilots intend to strike until Friday over the carrier's plans to expand the low-cost operations of its Transavia brand by setting up foreign bases. Their union said they stood ready to prolong the strike as both sides accused the other of causing an impasse in weekend negotiations.\n\nAn extended strike could become the airline's most serious dispute since a 10-day stoppage that disrupted France's hosting of the World Cup soccer tournament in 1998, union leaders said.\n\nShares in Franco-Dutch parent Air France-KLM\n\nIn Germany, pilot union Vereinigung Cockpit late on Monday said it had cancelled an eight-hour strike planned for Tuesday at Germany's biggest airline Lufthansa, which would have been the fourth strike to hit the airline within three weeks.\n\nNew competition from low-cost rivals and fast-growing long-haul carriers in the Gulf has prompted European carriers to speed up restructuring measures and tweak their business models.\n\nAlitalia is set to undergo restructuring and loss-making Finnair\n\nAir France-KLM Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac said the strike would cost Europe's second-largest flag carrier 10-15 million euros ($13-19 million) a day. He said it could have a damaging impact on the group's finances, but declined to say how quickly that might happen.\n\nThe strike left many check-in counters empty, days after de Juniac unveiled an ambitious new turnaround plan focusing on the expansion of the company's Transavia budget subsidiary.\n\nBoth sides expressed frustration over the failure to narrow differences over how pilots from the main airline would be recruited to the low-cost operation. Air France said pilots had meanwhile gone back on past agreements over the airline fleet.\n\n\"It is as though we had talked for 20 hours for nothing,\" de Juniac told a news conference.\n\nTransavia operates a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft and de Juniac said Transavia was ready to buy 22-23 more as it creates new opportunities for pilots and 1,000 new jobs.\n\nPilots union SNPL said it had proposed that Air France-KLM switch to Airbus A320s for the whole group, allowing pilots to switch between carriers according to the level of demand.\n\nBut both sides said the biggest roadblock was the pay and conditions for pilots switching from Air France to Transavia.\n\nDe Juniac said the plan would tap opportunities for growth that would otherwise not exist and allow long-haul co-pilots to move ahead in the queue for promotion to captain.\n\nBut SNPL accused Air France of carrying out a disguised form of offshoring by proposing to base some Transavia pilots in foreign bases on lower benefits and longer hours.\n\nSo far the strike at Air France-KLM, created from a merger of French and Dutch carriers in 2004, only involves French pilots. But Dutch pilots who fly for KLM warned they could drop their traditionally conservative stand on industrial action.\n\n\"The last strike we had was in 1995; we don't even know how to spell the word 'strike',\" said Steven Verhagen, president of the Dutch Airline Pilots' Association.\n\n\"We are eager to see Transavia as a European company but ... we don't want to see pilots from lower-cost countries taking our jobs. There is no imminent strike, but this could happen in the near future,\" he told reporters. \"We urge Mr de Juniac to find a solution (instead of) wasting money on playing hardball games.\"\n\nIn Germany, pilots cancelled a strike planned for 0700-1500 GMT on Tuesday at Lufthansa after receiving an adjusted list of demands in the ongoing row over an early retirement scheme. They want Lufthansa to maintain a scheme that allows pilots to retire early at the age of 55 and still receive up to 60 percent of their pay before regular pension payments start.\n\nShares in Europe's largest network carrier fell more than one percent, underperforming a fractionally weaker market.\n\n(Additional reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Mark Potter, Pravin Char and Michael Urquhart)", "The Boeing Co. is winning the battle for market share among low-cost carriers starting up in China, and that could be good news for Wichita.\n\nAccording to a report from the Seattle Times, Boeing says it has about 70 to 80 percent of the sales to that market in the past year, a marked difference from the roughly even split between Boeing and Airbus from the large, state-owned carriers.\n\nWhile some advise caution, noting that the Chinese government only formally announced it would allow such carriers late last year and that Airbus is being aggressive in trying to win back market share, any win in China is good for Boeing.\n\nIn the case of the low-cost carriers, it's also especially good news for Wichita because it has meant orders for the 737.\n\nWhile Spirit AeroSystems Inc. has work on all Boeing commercial aircraft, it has the most on the 737 program. Spirit (NYSE: SPR) builds about 70 percent of the 737 in Wichita.\n\nAnd nearly 30 percent of 737s built by Boeing last year were for Chinese customers.\n\nThat percentage is expected only to grow, as China is projected to pass the U.S. as the world's biggest market for commercial airplanes within the next decade.\n\nIhssane Mounir, Boeing senior vice president of sales for northeast Asia, told the Seattle Times that Beijing is now encouraging the startups to replicate what carriers like Southwest Airlines have done in the states.\n\nSouthwest flies an all-737 fleet.\n\nMounir adds that the entrepreneurial airlines starting up in China typically stick with one manufacturer -- and in the case of Boeing and the 737, that means potential increases to the single most important commercial program in the Air Capital.\n\nDaniel McCoy covers aviation, manufacturing and automotive.", "Imagine, for a moment, that you're an international salesman. You work for General Electric, which is one of the biggest producers of freight-hauling locomotives in the world. There's a demand in South Africa, and you want to get in on it.\n\nBut you're facing competition from several other locomotive manufacturers from around the world. You don't want to lose out to the Chinese locomotive company. So you get in touch with the Export-Import Bank back in Washington, D.C., to press for a loan for South Africa's state-owned rail operator, Transnet, that would enable them to purchase your locomotives, boosting your profits and, presumably, allowing you to hire more workers in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut China has its own Export-Import Bank, which could also offer Transnet a loan to buy Chinese locomotives. In fact, there are nearly 60 of these Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) around the world that effectively subsidize private companies' foreign exports.\n\nIn short, the Export-Import Bank lends to foreign buyers like Transnet to make U.S. exports competitive. Without an ECA of its own, the fear of the Bank's defenders is that U.S. exports would lose out to goods produced overseas.\n\nEstablished in the wake of World War II, when crippled foreign markets weren't strong enough to purchase American products, the Export-Import Act of 1945 has been renewed by Congress 16 times without a political fight as intense as this year's.\n\nWith its current authorization expiring on Oct. 1, the independent federal agency, which has just 400 employees, has been the subject of quite a bit of Washington's midsummer mudslinging. Of course, theirs is not the only expiration date looming at the end of this month. If Congress does not soon pass a spending bill, the entire government could shut down come October. Sound familiar?\n\nThe big news last week was that the Republican House leadership was considering a stopgap measure that would fund the government through Dec. 11. Included in that continuing resolution, much to the displeasure of their most conservative members, would be an extension of the Ex-Im Bank through June 2015. Conservatives, like House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have traditionally argued that propping up U.S. exports is the job of the private sector.\n\nThat short-term resolution was shelved for the rest of last week while the president asked Congress to consider funding for the training of Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State. But with members returning to their districts for a final midterm election push at the end of this week, the remaining days of legislative action are numbered.\n\nSuppose that resolution goes forward this week and the bank is extended for another nine months. That's better than it dying, said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of Economics, who serves on the Bank's advisory board.\n\nBut the danger with such a short-term extension, rather than the traditional two-year renewal, Hufbauer said, is that other export credit agencies from around the world would capitalize on the U.S. Bank's uncertain future. A Chinese ECA, for example, could convince Transnet that they'd be better off engaging in a long-term deal with them since the U.S. Ex-Im Bank might not be around in nine months.\n\nAnd without an Export-Import Bank at all, Hufbauer cautioned, there'd be little incentive for American manufacturers to actually make their goods in the United States. They could move to other countries with export credit agencies that would support their exports. The implicit threat in this narrative: the loss of American jobs.\n\nThe bank's official mission reads jobs, jobs jobs. Job support gets top billing in a press release announcing new deals with overseas buyers. Since 2009, the Bank touts that they've supported 1.2 million private sector jobs, and 205,000 in 2013. Even Paul Krugman, not the most enthusiastic supporter of the Bank, has argued that \"this is exactly the moment when ending an export-support program really would cost jobs.\"\n\nAnd yet, when GE actually did enter into a deal with Transnet this past March, they committed to manufacturing major parts of the locomotives in South Africa, which Transnet CEO Brian Molefe estimated would create about 30,000 indirect and direct domestic jobs -- in South Africa.\n\nBut the bank also supports exports produced by foreign companies in the United States, as long as enough material comes from U.S. suppliers and assembly occurs in the states. Ex-Im Bank president Fred Hochberg said this week that the Bank would back Airbus Group jetliner exports.\n\nBesides support for American jobs, the Bank champions its commitment to America's small businesses. In fiscal year 2013, nearly 90 percent of the Bank's volume of transactions was for short-term deals on behalf of American small businesses selling their goods overseas. But in terms of sales -- i.e., money transacted -- deals with big American businesses like Caterpillar, Boeing and GE dominate. About 46 percent of the Bank's financing is on behalf of Boeing alone.\n\nAnd that's where most of the attacks against the bank as an agent of \"corporate welfare\" come from. On the right, House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, whose committee oversees the Bank's renewal, has been among its most outspoken critics. Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth have slammed the government-backed bank for meddling in the free market, taking from the American taxpayer to enrich big business.\n\nThe Bank doesn't cost the taxpayer. In fact, it returns a profit to the Treasury -- more than $1 billion in fiscal year 2013. How it does that, though, says one of its critics on the left, is little more than arbitrage.\n\nIt works like this: The Ex-Im Bank borrows at the very low Treasury rate and then lends that money to its customers, like Transnet, at a higher rate. Provided borrowers don't default (the default rate was just 0.194 percent as of June 2014), that margin turns into a profit as foreign borrowers pay back the loan in installments. At the end of the year, the Bank turns that profit back to the Treasury.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture, said Center for Policy and Economic Research co-director Dean Baker, is that the government is such a low-cost borrower it can loan money to almost anyone and make money on that loan. In his opinion, there's no reason for that subsidy to bolster America's wealthiest corporations. He'd like to see more assistance support American small businesses. (Actually, he'd really prefer to reduce the value of the dollar to get the trade balance in order. For more detail on the relationship between the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign purchasing power, see our recent post on the Big Mac Index.)\n\nWithout Ex-Im Bank support, Boeing would ship fewer planes abroad, but it's not as if their exports would fall to zero, said Baker. Fewer exports would reduce their profits, too, but hardly enough to put a dent in GDP, Baker said.\n\nOf course, that's not the way American businesses see it. The Bank enjoys support from much of the business establishment of both political parties, especially groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, like much of his party, embraces the Bank and has urged Congress to renew it even though he too called it \"little more than a fund for corporate welfare\" when campaigning in 2008. Democrats in the House have been pushing for a five-year reauthorization of the Bank to avoid going throughout another fight like this year's anytime soon.\n\nIt now appears that conservatives in the House, including chief critic Hensarling, are ready to go along with a CR that extends the Bank's authority. \"Not the first time that I've swallowed hard in my congressional career,\" Hensarling said Wednesday.\n\nBut if the House GOP plans to let the bank survive a little longer, that may, as Veronique de Rugy suggests in National Review, only reflect \"hopes of killing it in the long term.\"\n\nLongtime Ex-Im Bank defender Eric Cantor is gone, replaced by a House Majority Leader who's pledged to let it die. And by June, its GOP opponents may have two advantages: the Bank's expiration will be decoupled from the funding of the government, and there's a decent chance their party will control not just the House, but the Senate, too.\n\nAs for the Bank's prospects for long-term survival after a short-term extension, Bank advisory board member Hufbauer said, \"I wouldn't give it better than 50-50.\"", "European travellers face growing disruption after Air France pilots began a week-long strike in a dispute over cost cuts and Deutsche Lufthansa AG pilots called their fourth walkout in three weeks over early-retirement rights.\n\nAir France said it had been forced to cancel six out of 10 flights on Monday and predicted the same level of groundings the next day, while an eight-hour strike by Lufthansa pilots was set to disrupt two dozen flights on Tuesday.\n\nAir France pilots intend to strike until Friday over the carrier's plans to expand the low-cost operations of its Transavia brand by setting up foreign bases.

room.\n\nEither way, an Airbus proposal for in-flight virtual reality sensory isolation headgear that controls sights, sounds and even smells experienced by travelers is likely to turn heads -- although if the heads are stuck in helmets, there might not be much room for turning.\n\nThe European aircraft manufacturer has filed a patent for the headgear which French inventor Bernard Guering says could help alleviate boredom, reduce stress and prevent injury via a mini-airbag system designed to deploy in the event of turbulence.\n\n\"During aircraft flights, certain passengers have periods when they are bored either during a wait phase preceding take off or following landing or during a cruise phase,\" the patent application says.\n\n\"More-over it is known that aircraft flights generate stress for certain passengers.\"\n\nMORE: Airbus files patent for saddle seats on planes\n\n'Odorous substances'\n\nThe patent suggests that placing passengers in partial or total \"sensorial isolation\" by piping audio and video directly into their eyes and ears -- and squirting \"odorous substances\" up their nose -- will help make all this go away.\n\n\"This isolation allows the passenger to better profit from some of the distractions offered, for example listening to music, watching films,\" says the screed attached to the invention blueprints.\n\n\"If the passengers is sensitive to stress, this isolation, possibly associated with one of the above-mentioned activities allows him/her to more easily calm down and relax.\"\n\nThe helmets, designed to be incorporated into the headrest, will also feature remote controls and technology that projects a virtual reality keyboard on the fold down table, enabling passengers to hammer out emails directly on to the detritus of their in-flight meal.\n\nIt's not known if there are any plans to introduce the helmets in the near future -- Airbus hasn't responded to a CNN query -- but it's likely they're at the same distant stage as another unusual Airbus patent that proposes cycle saddle-style seating.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether sensory isolation can genuinely improve the in-flight experience, but the innovation must surely be a gift to airline staff.\n\nWhile the eyes of their passengers are helmeted in virtual reality, cabin crew can return to actual reality and relax the mandatory smiles.",

state-of-the-art jetliner, the Boeing B787-8 Dreamliner in August of 2012, it took many by surprise. How can a poor country like Ethiopia become second next to Japan to own and operate the most sophisticated airliner in the world?\n\nEthiopian was the first African carrier to join the jet age in the 1960s by bringing the first B720 jetliner to Africa. Again it was the first airline in Africa to acquire the Boeing 767 in 1984. It was also the first carrier in Sub-Saharan Africa to place orders for the Airbus 350XWB in 2009.\n\nThe national flag carrier is still renewing its fleet, expanding its international and domestic routes and building its infrastructure tremendously. At a time when the global airline industry is traversing through turbulent times, Ethiopian has been recognized by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as the largest carrier in Africa. Ethiopian became, for the first time in its 69 year history, the largest African carrier with revenue topping 2.3 billion dollars in 2013 and profit, according to the airlines ranking of the IATA published in the 58th edition of World Air Transport Statistics.\n\nAccording to IATA's annual airline ranking published last June, Ethiopian ranks first in Africa and 37th in the world in revenue as well as first in Africa and 18th in the world in operating profit.\n\nEthiopian Airlines is a global Pan-African carrier currently serving 83 international destinations across 5 continents with over 200 daily departures and operating 66 modern aircrafts such as the B777 and B787. Ethiopian registered this remarkable growth at a time when mega carriers like Qantas and Air France KLM were declaring loss. What makes Ethiopian's success story unique is that it is a state owned company. One of the reasons often cited for most African airlines' failure is their state ownership. Ethiopian has disproved this logic.\n\nThough Ethiopian Airlines has a glorious history that started in 1946, the general aviation in the country is at its infant stage. There are 16 foreign airlines that fly to Addis Ababa. However, it is only Ethiopian Airlines that operates scheduled domestic flight services in the country. Foreign airlines are not allowed to operate domestic flight services. Private operators until recently could not operate aircrafts that had more than 20 seats. Recently, the seat limitation was pushed to 50. Domestic flight service is only allowed for Ethiopian nationals. Foreign investors cannot invest in private airlines.\n\nIn 2011, the number of registered private airlines reached 26, out of which only six were active. Accordingly, the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA), the regulatory body of the aviation sector revoked the licenses of 20 of the registered airlines on the grounds that they were not operational.\n\nAccording to ECAA, currently there are 15 registered private airlines. Recently, the authority granted licenses to three new private airlines that are under preparation to launch flight services.\n\nAt the moment there are six private airlines that provide charter flight services-Abyssinian Flight Services, National Airways, Trans National Airways, Suhura Aviation, Amibara General Aviation and Zemen Flight Service. Amibara Aviation is a pesticide dusting company while Suhura Aviation provides cargo charter flight services. The rest provide charter flight services in Ethiopia and neighboring countries.\n\nEthiopia is a land locked country and air transport has a crucial importance. The road network and railway lines are not well developed yet and the rugged terrain of the country makes air transport an indispensable means of transport. Despite all these facts, the domestic airline industry is still at its infant stage.", "Find out more about local businesses that use the Export-Import bank: http://seati.ms/1rUPcxW\n\nTucked into an industrial park in Seattle's Magnolia neighborhood is a small company that makes smart dummies.\n\nThe high-tech manikins, a customized version of which sells for as much as $500,000, simulate the human body's response to heat, cold, moisture and other conditions. They can test temperature ratings for sleeping bags or mimic passengers sweating in automobile seats.\n\nHonda, Nike, Airbus and the U.S. Army are all customers.\n\nBut if Measurement Technology Northwest were to land an order from, say, Nigeria or Brazil, it wouldn't make a sale without the Export-Import Bank.\n\nThat's because the Export-Import Bank, an export credit agency owned by the U.S. government, sells insurance against deadbeat customers overseas. If Measurement Technology doesn't get paid within 180 days, the bank covers 90 percent of the amount owed.\n\n\"It's a lot more intimidating for foreign customers to not pay the U.S. Export-Import Bank than it is for them to not pay us,\" said Tim O'Neill, president and founder of Measurement Technology. Without the assurance that comes with the clout of a federal agency, selling in some countries \"is incredibly risky.\"\n\nSo it is with much worry that O'Neill has watched the bank, called Ex-Im for short, teeter on the brink of extinction. Congressional critics for weeks have been fighting against renewing the Depression-era agency's charter, which expires at the end of this month. Opponents regard the bank as corporate welfare that displaces private-sector lenders.\n\nLast Thursday -- after a temporary capitulation by a faction of House Republicans -- the chamber was set to vote on reauthorizing the bank for nine more months as part of a larger bill to keep the federal government funded until mid-December. But the vote was pushed back until this week, in part to consider President Obama's request to include in the bill authority to train rebels against the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nThat further postponed the reckoning over what conservatives and free-market disciples deride as \"Boeing's bank.\" The aerospace giant accounted for $8.3 billion, or 30 percent, of the $27.3\u2009billion in financial commitments underwritten by the Ex-Im Bank in 2013, making it the biggest corporate beneficiary by far.\n\nBut thousands of small businesses are also caught in the debate. The vast majority of the 100 or so companies in Washington state that use the bank each year are small enterprises whose employees number in the hundreds, if not dozens.\n\nAmong them are Woodinville's Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, which insures its shipments against payment defaults; Seattle's Nucor steel company; and Bellevue's Concordia Beverage Systems, which makes commercial espresso machines.\n\nThe benefit to local companies is a major reason members of the state's congressional delegation -- with the exception of Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Spokane -- fully support the bank.\n\nThey include all three of McMorris Rodgers' fellow Republicans. One of them, Rep. Dave Reichert of Auburn, twice wrote House Speaker John Boehner and then Majority Leader-Elect Kevin McCarthy urging reauthorization, saying it's \"good for businesses of Washington and it is good for businesses in every part of America.\"\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, the House GOP's No. 4 leader, has said she recognizes the value of the Ex-Im Bank to her district. Still, she has not given unequivocal support, saying any reauthorization should be conditional on reforms to make the bank more transparent and accountable.\n\nThe issue has become a gauge for tea-party and conservative bona fides. The conservative advocacy groups Heritage Action and the Club for Growth are whipping opposition to renewing the bank's charter.\n\nJim McDonald, chief executive of SCAFCO Grain Systems in Spokane, said customer financing offered by Ex-Im Bank can mean the difference between sale and no sale. His company sells bins, silos and conveyors against cheaper competitors from China, India, Turkey and elsewhere.\n\nThe bank makes direct loans to SCAFCO's customers at favorable rates with money borrowed from the U.S. Treasury. Foreign buyers otherwise may not be able to make the purchase, McDonald said, because their banks and governments are geared to finance exports, not imports.\n\nIn contrast, the bulk of the bank's dealings with Boeing involves loan guarantees for American banks. Such was the case in 2013 when the Ex-Im Bank helped Boeing close a deal to sell a fleet of Renton-produced 737-900ER jetliners to Indonesia's Lion Air.\n\nNew York's Apple Bank for Savings financed the contract. But Ex-Im Bank provided $1.1 billion in loan guarantees, protecting Apple Bank for every penny if the Indonesian carrier defaults.\n\nNearly one of five Boeing jetliner sales hinges on Export-Import Bank financing. Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, recently told a Seattle business group, \"We cannot lose Ex-Im Bank, period.\"\n\nFor SCAFCO, international sales make up 60 percent of revenue. If Congress does away with the bank, McDonald said, \"We would most likely lose sales and we would also probably lose employees.\"\n\nThis summer, McDonald made a video testimonial as part of a lobbying effort for the bank by the Association of Washington Business, the state's chamber of commerce group. McDonald also has spoken to McMorris Rodgers, his congresswoman. He said he believes McMorris Rodgers supports the bank, but she did not promise her vote.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, said a vocal minority of House Republicans has hijacked the Ex-Im Bank for partisan means. She contends their objections make no economic sense.\n\n\"You'd be giving away a very competitive advantage,\" Cantwell said. \"Basically you are shipping jobs overseas.\"\n\nIn July, Cantwell co-sponsored a bipartisan Senate bill to renew the bank's charter for five years. Opponents, including House Majority Leader McCarthy and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, favor getting rid of the Ex-Im Bank and ending \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nThe bank has generated excess revenues -- from fees, premiums and interest -- in recent years that are returned to the Treasury. Excess collections fluctuate greatly, but in 2013, it had $1.057 billion left after covering its administrative costs and setting aside reserves for losses.\n\nO'Neill, the Magnolia businessman, said the Ex-Im Bank makes it possible for his two companies to do deals in countries where they couldn't recover unpaid debt on their own. Thermal manikins are O'Neill's flagship product. But his companies also produce a range of other specialized equipment, including industrial and marine control and monitoring systems and equipment for large composting facilities.\n\nThough the combined companies had more than $11 million in revenue last year, O'Neill said one big missed or late payment from a customer could seriously jeopardize their cash flow. Ex-Im Bank helps by vetting foreign customers and stepping in if O'Neill's companies get stiffed.\n\n\"We're not that sophisticated, and we don't have a lawyer in the building,\" O'Neill, 57, said.\n\nHalf of the combined sales of Measurement Technology and the second company, Engineered Compost Systems, came from overseas. Of that, about $2 million, or 40\u2009percent, were deals insured by Ex-Im Bank -- protection that allowed O'Neill's companies to gamble on new customers in such countries as Poland, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHad it not been for the export insurance, O'Neill said, \"We would have walked away from most of this business.\"", "Boeing Co and European rival Airbus said on Thursday they are both considering seriously whether to make their best-selling narrow-body jetliners at faster rates, news that may cheer investors in the short term but could raise longer-term market concerns.\n\nAirbus is studying whether to increase production of its best-selling A320-family aircraft beyond the record level of 46 jets a month already targeted for 2016, and a decision could come by year-end, Airbus Americas President Barry Eccleston told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington.\n\n\"If we're going to make that decision, we would want to make that decision as soon as possible, because the market's already there,\" Eccleston said.\n\nSeparately, Boeing has seriously considered increasing production of its 737 narrow-body airplanes to more than 47 a month, President and Chief Operating Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a separate interview at the summit. Boeing's current 737 output is a record 42 a month and it already has plans to lift the rate to 47 a month in 2017.\n\n\"We now see continuing pressure to further increase that,\" Muilenburg said in a television interview at the Reuters summit. \"We've taken a very serious look at options, both timing and volume, but clearly pressure is in an upward direction.\"\n\nIndustry experts expect Boeing's next target would be 52 a month, and Muilenburg's comments suggest the analysis may be largely complete, and that the results may be known shortly.\n\nIn August, Boeing's chief financial officer, Greg Smith, signaled the company was close to deciding whether to push 737 production to 52 a month. On Monday, the chief executive officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Ray Conner, said the plane maker was feeling \"incredible pressure to go higher in rate.\"\n\nThe upward push in production is being driven by scorching demand from airlines for new, fuel-efficient versions of the planes.\n\nAirbus and Boeing have years of production backlog on their order books, so customers ordering planes now must wait years to get them. Raising output allows more near-term plane deliveries.\n\nBut for both companies, the ability to increase rates depends on whether suppliers can keep up and support higher production levels and pose a quandary for investors.\n\nWhile delivering more planes rings the cash register at Airbus, Boeing and their suppliers, it also can raise costs and chip away at profit margins. Specialized models also can do that, such as a 200-seat version of the 737 MAX that Boeing launched with Ryanair on Monday.\n\n\"You're building a new plane for Ryanair. There's no way this doesn't dilute margins,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nChurning out 50 or 60 jets a month could cut profit margins a percentage point on those planes, he said, because costs could rise at such high production levels. \"You're not exactly reaching for the stratosphere in terms of profitability.\"\n\nHe noted: \"If you push it to 60 and keep it there too long...you're going to have engineered a bust cycle.\"\n\nEccleston also said that Airbus is close to finding a buyer for six Rolls-Royce powered A380s superjumbos that had been earmarked for Skymark Airlines Inc of Japan. Airbus recently cancelled the order because of the airline's inability to make the required advance payments. Eccleston declined to elaborate on who the buyer might be. (Reuters)"], "2014-09-16": ["Airbus has filed a patent for helmets to provide \"sensorial isolation.\" US Patent Office\n\nIn a world where economy-class seats are getting thinner and lavatories are shrinking, any flight longer than an hour can feel like a traveling prison. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus is abetting the shift, but a recent patent filing shows it hasn't forgotten about you, the passenger who actually has to sit in these miserable flying cells. It's considering helmets that will let you forget you're in an airplane at all.\n\nFlying can be boring or stressful, which is why airlines provide music, movies and bad TV. The next step appears to be thoroughly immersing passengers in what they're watching. \"The helmet in which the passenger houses his/her head offers him/her sensorial isolation with regard to the external environment,\" reads the patent filing.\n\nThe helmets feature headphones to provide music. You can watch movies (perhaps in 3D) on the \"opto-electronic\" screen or possibly through \"image diffusion glasses.\" If you want to get some work done, turn on the virtual keyboard, which appears on your tray, don a pair of motion capture gloves, and type away. The helmet could even pipe in different odors for an olfactory treat, and the whole thing would be nicely ventilated.\n\nThere would be various ways to wear the helmet, and the screen would go up and down. US Patent Office\n\nThe idea, definitely in a preliminary stage, is both horrifying and brilliant. Horrifying, because flying already stinks and the need to strap on a virtual reality helmet to make you forget just how hellish it is feels like a creepy add-on. Brilliant, because there's no reason to expect economy class to become pleasant anytime soon, and the people packed into those thin, confining seats already look for ways to distract themselves. Thus, eye masks and noise-canceling headphones. Virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift promise great things. If people are getting excited about wearing headsets that let them play sweet games, why wouldn't they want to use them while traveling?\n\nDon't expect the helmets anytime soon, though. This is merely a patent filing, and an Airbus rep says the company isn't doing anything to bring the idea to market; it's just protecting its IP. Beyond that, adding something like this would require navigating an American Ninja Warrior-level obstacle course of regulations governing absolutely everything about civil aviation. Then, airlines would have to want to buy them. Cost aside, the added weight (Read: higher fuel bill) makes it a hard sell, especially since passengers can entertain themselves quite nicely with an iPad or, for the Luddites, a book.\n\nIf Airbus does bring this to market, it should include a setting to virtually transport yourself to first class.\n\nFig. 14 shows the \"image diffusion glasses\" that could be included with the helmet. You can see how air would circulate in Fig. 15, and the virtual keyboard in Fig. 16.

We fantasize about bathroom sex, and are afforded a God's eye view of the landscapes far, far below. But really, flying is a drag. Anyone who's been confined to a tiny airborne cylinder with a crying baby and an especially chatty cross-section of humanity can attest to this. Flying sucks.\n\nThat's why European aviation manufacturer Airbus is trying to make air travel a little less hellish with a patent they filed for onboard individual virtual reality headsets.\n\nAirbus' patent filing, which was dug up by Peter Terlato of Business Insider, describes a moveable isolation helmet not unlike those worn by silver-haired grannies at the hair salon. Invented by one Bernard Guering, the helmets would allow for passengers to watch films or listen to music in solitude, unperturbed by the unwashed masses.\n\nThe filing also describes how the helmet would come with glasses for diffusing images, giving any video displayed on the visor an immersive effect. A virtual keyboard would also be projected onto passengers' trays.\n\nPart 1950s technological fever dream, part Homer Simpson car for in-air entertainment, Airbus' proposed helmet is stuffed with features that seem more Jetsons than jet travel. For example, the helmets will have a cooling airflow system, an internet connection, be able to diffuse \"odorous substances\" throughout the helmet, and an airbag on the back because apparently this thing could kill the person sitting behind it in the case of sudden acceleration.\n\nAlthough it remains to be seen if the patent will be accepted, not to mention actually implemented, the filing notes that the helmet could be installed on every seat in a plane, or on a select few as a paid option.\n\nAirbus' patent filing comes at a time when virtual reality entertainment is finally (maybe) getting a little wind in its sails. Oculus Rift has found use in flight simulators -- you can fly like a bird -- and Sony's Project Morpheus is being positioned as a way to bring consumer video games into the virtual realm. As overwrought as it seems, Airbus' patent may just be ahead of its time.", "Gulf carrier Emirates, which is the second carrier operating jumbo aircraft A380 to India, today said it has no plans to windrow the plane from operations.\n\n\"A380 (aircraft) is here to stay...We have the approvals from the authorities,\" Emirates vice president for India and Nepal, Essa Sulaiman Ahmad said in a response to a query.\n\nAhmad's assertion came after a section of media had reported that the Dubai-based airline may suspend its A380 operations to India.\n\nHe said that A380 was a flagship product for the Emirates and has received a wide acceptance from the customers all over.\n\nEmirates is the world's largest Airbus A380 operators.

Airbus, which also has aircraft manufacturing and its helicopter divisions, employs about 144,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business generates most of the company's revenue, which was \u20ac59.3 billion in 2013.\n\nShares of Airbus were up less than 1 percent at \u20ac49.05 in midday trading in Paris on Tuesday.", "MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA -- Australia is sending up to eight F/A-18F Super Hornet strike fighters, an Airbus KC-30 multirole tanker transport and an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft to the Middle East this week for possible use against Islamic State forces in Iraq.\n\nThe Australian contingent will move to the United Arab Emirates where they will prepare for operations, ahead of a government decision regarding Iraq.\n\nThe move, which also includes 400 Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) support personnel and 200 ground troops, was announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Sunday.\n\nThe ground troops will include Special Forces, which will be used to train Iraqi military personnel and Kurdish peshmerga fighters.\n\nThis marks the first time Australian Super Hornets have been deployed to the region since entering service in 2010, and the first time RAAF combat aircraft have deployed with both organic tanker and AEW&C support.\n\n\"The decision to prepare Australian Defence Force personnel for deployment has not been taken lightly,\" Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, chief of the Australian Defence Force, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a highly complex operating environment which continues to evolve, and we now have a significant amount of detailed planning work to undertake as we prepare for this deployment.\n\n\"Disrupting and degrading ISIL will take a comprehensive and sustained effort from the international community.

I think from Australia's point of view, if you look at the scale of forces that we can deploy and recognizing the RAAF is at the moment working to introduce a broad range of platforms to service, this will be a demanding deployment. But I'd say it's a deployment which is commensurate with Australia's interests in this issue,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think we should underestimate what the RAAF is doing now, deploying the tankers and the AEW&C with fighters at the same time, at distance from Australia. This is a challenging exercise that they'll undoubtedly learn a lot from.\"\n\nThomson also said that it is difficult to estimate how long Australian forces will need to remain in the region.\n\n\"The word complex doesn't come close to capturing the situation we're moving into.

It also signalled a further strategic shift with the revelation that it was exploring \"industrial alternatives\" for its security and defence electronics businesses.\n\nThe move highlights Airbus's deflated ambitions in the defence realm, after its \u20ac36bn plan to combine with Britain's BAE Systems in 2012 fell foul of German government opposition. It comes just weeks after Airbus completed the merger of its defence and space businesses into a single unit, which involves cutting up to 5,800 jobs and site closures in France, Germany, Spain and the UK.\n\nTom Enders, Airbus chief executive, has said there was an \"urgent\" need to improve the unit's competitiveness as European governments slash defence spending.\n\nAirbus is seeking to reach a group return on sales target of between 7 and 8 per cent next year, excluding certain development costs, but the defence and space unit poses potential obstacles to this goal, partly because European governments are cutting defence budgets in response to austerity.\n\nMr Enders said the disposals announced on Tuesday would \"result in an even stronger focus on our group's core activities, aeronautics and space\".\n\nThe businesses being sold are a mix of wholly and partially owned units. They include thermal management group Fairchild Controls; a German submarine systems business jointly held with ThyssenKrupp, called Atlas Elektronik; fighter pilot training operation AvDef; and the cabin simulator company, Rostock System-Technik.\n\nThyssenKrupp said it was considering whether to exercise its right of first refusal to buy out Airbus' 49 per cent stake in Atlas. Airbus paid an estimated \u20ac60m for the stake in 2005, beating off fierce competition from Thales, the French defence electronics group.\n\nThales is now being mooted by analysts as a potential buyer of some of the businesses being shed by Airbus. However the German government would have to approve any buyer as Atlas is regarded as important to national security.\n\nThere is also a high degree of political sensitivity surrounding the security and defence electronics businesses which include several government contracts. Airbus said that options from outright disposal to joint ventures and partnerships would be considered.\n\nAirbus is expected to identify potential buyers by the end of this year with disposals completed by the middle of 2015. The group insisted these were strong businesses, although it refused to quantify the level of profit they generated.\n\nAnalysts were broadly positive about the moves. Investec estimates that Airbus could raise proceeds in the range of \u20ac1.5bn to \u20ac2bn.\n\nChristophe Menard of Kepler Cheuvreux said the announcement showed Airbus \"delivers on its strategic promises\". However the disposals would not result in a big upgrade to forecasts, he added, as the process would not be completed before next year.\n\nAirbus has also signalled its desire to sell its 46 per cent stake in the business jet and military aircraft group Dassault Aviation, controlled by the influential Dassault family of France. Dassault is due to hold a shareholder meeting next week at which investors will be asked to support a share buyback, which could accelerate a disposal by Airbus.", "BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - AIRBUS (EAD.PA)Group\n\nAnnouncing the results of a portfolio review, Europe's largest aerospace group signalled a break with previous efforts to diversify into security activities and a halt to investment in defence electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals.\n\nEurope's defence industry is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back on military spending.

The choice of venue was ironic in light of the scandal: it was on this side of the Berlin Wall where the Stasi, communist east Germany's secret police, spied on its citizens for decades.\n\nThis legacy gave the US spying revelations a particularly forceful impact in Germany - and on the nation's chancellor, who grew up in east Germany. Ms Merkel pressed Mr Obama on the programme that day in June last year, still months before the revelation that the US had listened to her private phone calls.\n\nIn a joint press conference with Mr Obama, Ms Merkel caused a stir by referring to the internet as \"Neuland\" - uncharted territory - and suggested it was a potential threat to liberty. \"The internet is uncharted territory for us all,\" she declared. \"And it makes it possible for enemies and opponents of our democratic order to endanger our way of life with entirely new means and entirely new approaches.\"\n\nHer stark comments laid bare the gulf emerging between some of Europe's policy makers and the prevailing view in the US, not least with the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who see an unfettered web as a tool for spreading liberty.\n\nFifteen months later Silicon Valley is facing a powerful backlash across Europe. Nowhere is the resentment fiercer than in Europe's biggest economy. Taxi drivers have protested against Uber, the US ride-sharing service, from London to Milan, but it is in Germany that a militant taxi industry has won a countrywide injunction against the company. A senior German politician has called for a break-up of Google, fearing the company has abused its dominance of search. And German media groups are pressing politicians in Brussels to take a harder line on Google and other US internet groups.\n\nIt took the leaks about NSA surveillance to bring the issue into the open, but the strong emotions that have been stirred up point to far deeper anxieties about Germany's place in the digital world. For many years Germany \"has totally misunderstood the importance and relevance\" of the internet, says Stefan Heumann of the Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a think-tank.\n\n\"With [Edward] Snowden, they've come to realise it's at the centre of geostrategic influence and they are in a very weak position,\" Mr Heumann says. \"Most of the software and the innovative business models in the internet come from the US.\"\n\nGermany's reaction has been the most pronounced, but it reflects an unease across continental Europe about the growing power of digital platforms controlled from across the Atlantic. Germany - along with France, with which it is closely aligned on internet issues - is working to define the digital agenda that will shape the next European Commission, which takes office later this year.\n\nThis looks set to involve actions to curtail the dominance of the big US technology groups, as well as a crackdown on how they handle personal data. Tech entrepreneurs are braced for a wave of regulation that they warn could squash the very innovation that Europe needs to inject life into its sluggish economies.\n\nThe backlash has been marked by a visceral anger among some of Europe's political leaders, leaving US tech executives worried that the repercussions will be difficult to predict or control, and the potential damage all the greater.\n\n\"It's emotional and personal,\" says Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, of the way that politicians such Ms Merkel have recoiled at the NSA revelations.\n\nHe recounts how, at a recent dinner in Germany, the German chancellor lashed out at the way US intelligence services had bugged her personal phone, asking sarcastically: \"Were they trying to listen to the calls with my mother?\"\n\nThe result, says Mr Schmidt, has been a fundamental breakdown in trust on the part of Germany's leaders: \"They perceive that this special bond they have with the US is broken.\"\n\nThis has brought to the fore growing anxieties over the country's poor competitiveness in digital services and a possible erosion of cultural identity. \"There is technology angst,\" says Peter Thiel, one of Silicon Valley's most successful tech investors and himself a German. \"It's about European decline. There is a sense in Silicon Valley that it is on the right side of history, and Europe is on the wrong side of history.\" While sharing the belief himself, Mr Thiel warns that it is a \"dangerous view\" and that it will bring an even greater backlash in Europe.\n\nIt is Google, however, that has become the focus of much of the anxiety. Brussels last week threw out a compromise that would have resolved a long-running competition investigation, raising the risk of a formal indictment. The company's vaunting ambition has fanned the worries, as it sets its eyes on markets as varied as electric cars and health.\n\nGoogle is seen as the archetype of the overreaching US tech company, even as it tries to be seen as international in its outlook, says Mr Thiel, a director of rival Facebook. \"'Don't be evil' as a corporate slogan\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009sounds to Europe incredibly American, dividing the world into good and evil,\" he says.\n\nThe search for ways to counter Google echoes earlier transatlantic battles over control of strategically important industries, says Evgeny Morozov, a critic of the unfettered power of internet companies. At \"exclusive gatherings\" across the continent, there is frequent talk of \"the need to follow the example of Airbus\" and create an alternative to Google, he says.\n\nStitching together a new industrial champion is harder to achieve, however, when Europe lacks a base of successful smaller companies. A previous attempt to launch a \"European Google\" - the Quaero search project, announced by the French and German political leaders nine years ago - quickly flopped.\n\nSome European entrepreneurs hope that worries about privacy and security following the NSA scandal will give initiatives such as this a new lease of life. They include Qwant, a French search engine start-up that has an emphasis on privacy for users. It recently attracted an investment from Axel Springer, the German media group whose chief executive, Mathias D\u00f6pfner, has led the charge against Google, which he has accused of seeking a digital \"superstate\".\n\nQwant remains a tiny player in a market driven by network effects, however. Though it processed more than half a billion search requests last year, the number is dwarfed by the more than 100bn a month handled by Google.\n\nWith attempts to counter Google flagging, Brussels has faced a stream of complaints about the US company's tactics.\n\n\"Start-up companies in Europe can do well, until they are medium-sized - but when they get bigger, when they try to go global, they become a threat,\" says Paulo Trezentos, a Portuguese tech entrepreneur who accuses Google of anti-competitive behaviour.\n\nAptoide, the Portuguese mobile app store company he runs, is one of more than a dozen companies that have protested to Brussels about Google's Android mobile operating system. In a complaint that closely echoes the earlier European case against Microsoft's Windows, the EU is expected to look at whether Google abuses the dominance of Android to favour its own services, such as maps or its app store. Google declined to comment.\n\nUndeterred, Google has been trying to paint itself as the champion of innovation in Europe. In June, announcing the company's investment in a Berlin start-up venue called The Factory, Mr Schmidt declared that Germany was becoming a \"start-up nation\".\n\nThe pitch was carefully calibrated to \"appeal to European anxiety\", says Mr Morozov, by playing on the insecurities local politicians feel over the far greater success of US tech entrepreneurs.\n\nGoogle's campaign to keep Europe's digital markets open is echoed by some homegrown tech entrepreneurs.\n\nJan Rezab, chief executive of Socialbakers, a Prague-based company that monitors social networks for leading brands, warns that attacks by European regulators on Silicon Valley business models would be counter-productive.\n\n\"This will only lead to destruction, not innovation,\" he says. \"We need to spend less time wondering if this should or should not be allowed. Yes, glasses will be broken, taxi drivers will lose jobs. That's the world, that's the market.\"\n\nSupporters of the German start-up scene hope for a breakthrough with the pending IPO of Rocket Internet, an internet incubator with investments in companies in developing countries. Rocket's mission to become the largest internet platform outside the US and China demonstrates the ambition of European tech entrepreneurs, says Saul Klein, a London- based investor.\n\nThe number of European start-ups achieving valuations of \u20ac1bn has been growing rapidly, he adds. That may be much less than the $18bn valuation recently given to Uber, but it still represents a progression that hints at more continent-wide companies to come.\n\nThe fear of digital domination by the US raises questions that reach deeper than industrial competitiveness, as the instinctive distrust that Ms Merkel expressed for the open internet suggests. Writing this year in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Sigmar Gabriel, the German economy minister, laid out the scale of the conflict: \"It is the future of democracy in the digital age that is at stake here.\"\n\nThe concerns in Europe have converged on the question of how personal data are handled. Supporters of stronger privacy rules have been emboldened by this year's \"right to be forgotten\" ruling, which lets European citizens ask for links to information about them to be removed from Google.\n\nAccording to Mr Gabriel, the case has \"re-established the sovereignty of law by ruling that Google can no longer simply bypass European standards\", making it a call to action for European politicians to push for more.\n\nBerlin has shown its hand since the surveillance scandal, giving its backing to the reinstatement of a measure that would limit the ability of US intelligence agencies to spy on EU citizens. The provision, contained in article 42 of the EU's proposed data protection regulation, would bar the disclosure of an EU citizen's data to a third party abroad without authorisation by a European data protection authority. That would put US companies in a bind when served with a US court order requiring them to hand over the same data - a conflict they say would make the system unworkable.\n\nSilicon Valley is already braced for a hostile reception from the incoming administration in Brussels. European political circles have been rife with talk that incoming European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker owes a debt to Axel Springer's Mr D\u00f6pfner, who publicly backed him while Ms Merkel was hesitating over the choice.\n\nMartin Selmayr, head of Mr Juncker's cabinet, is regarded by US tech industry lobbyists with concern, since he has worked with EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding, a strong supporter of tougher privacy rules.\n\n\"Obviously for him to see a tough data protection regulation going through is a priority - it's personal to him,\" says a lobbyist for the tech industry.\n\nThe change of tone in Brussels is evident from the EU's new digital policy chief G\u00fcnther Oettinger, who warned Google last week that it faced curbs on its market power. The German commissioner replaces Neelie Kroes, who had sided with Uber in its fight.\n\nEven as the climate changes in Brussels, national regulators have already been growing more hostile. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government in France has introduced legislation to curb free delivery of books by Amazon in a bid to protect the country's network of traditional independent booksellers. It has also forced Google to pay \u20ac60m to aid struggling French newspapers after threatening laws to force it to share revenues from links to online stories.\n\nLocal regulators and courts in Europe are starting to cast a wary eye on the social consequences that stem from the sort of digital disruption championed by Silicon Valley. The latest test will come as Uber appears in court in Frankfurt today over a nationwide ban imposed on its Uber Pop service. By ignoring rules applied to other taxi services, it is gaining an unfair advantage, critics say.\n\n\"We will most certainly not change these laws, and if Uber does not fully comply then they will have to take a closer look at their business model,\" Heiko Maas, Germany's justice minister, told the FT.\n\nThe political pressure in Europe for greater controls on the internet economy is mounting, particularly when it comes to the data-handling regulations that set the basic rules of the road.\n\n\"This is the conundrum Europeans are in, if they decide to implement a very high data protection standard,\" says Mr Heumann of the Stiftung Neue Verantwortung think-tank. \"It would make it hard for US companies to operate here - but it would also undermine the European tech industry.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Murad Ahmed and Hugh Carnegy\n\nThank you for your participation. We have summarised the findings of this survey in a blog post", "Stacked inside the shroud of an Ariane 5 rocket, two commercial television broadcasting satellites for Malaysian and Australian telecommunications companies blasted off from French Guiana on Thursday.\n\nThe Measat 3b and Optus 10 spacecraft rocketed away from a launch pad in Kourou, French Guiana, at 2205 GMT (6:05 p.m. EDT), riding on top of an 18-story Ariane 5 booster to begin 15-year missions to broadcast television programming to millions of customers in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nLiftoff of the Ariane 5 rocket was delayed 44 minutes after a status board at the European-run Guiana Space Center displayed a \"red\" condition, signaling a problem. No details of the issue were released during the launch's official webcast. [Photos: Amazing Rocket Launches of 2014]\n\nThe countdown was paused twice, including a hold 27 seconds before liftoff before the launch team reset the clock to the 7-minute mark.\n\nOfficials said ground teams needed more time to configure a downrange tracking station in Kenya.\n\nOnce the problem was cleared, the countdown resumed under a computer-controlled synchronized sequence. The Ariane 5 pressurized its propellant tanks and ignited its Vulcain 2 main engine when the countdown reached zero.\n\nSeven seconds later, after passing an automated health check, the rocket fired its two solid-fueled boosters and blasted off on top of a column of hot orange exhaust.\n\nThe Ariane 5's hydrogen-fueled core engine and twin solid rocket boosters pushed the launcher into a clear sky, passing the speed of sound in 41 seconds as it pitched east over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe two boosters burned their pre-packed powder propellant in a little over 2 minutes and fell away from the Ariane 5 rocket to plummet back into the sea 41 miles below. The Ariane 5's main stage continued firing as it released a nose shroud to expose the mission's dual-payload composite once the rocket flew into the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Vulcain 2 engine gave way to the launcher's upper stage engine 9 minutes after liftoff. On cue, the rocket's HM7B second stage powerplant switched off after a 16-minute burn to put the Measat 3b and Optus 10 satellites into an on-target geostationary transfer orbit, an egg-shaped path around Earth used as a waypoint to the craft's final operating positions.\n\nIn a three-step deployment procedure, the Ariane 5's upper stage released Measat 3b, then ejected a Sylda dual-payload adapter covering Optus 10. Then the rocket separated Optus 10 about at 2239 GMT (6:39 p.m. EDT), prompting smiles and applause to break the tension inside the control room in Kourou. []\n\n\"Arianespace has just received confirmation from our on-board telemetry systems that Measat 3b and Optus 10 were separated as planned,\" said Stephane Israel, chairman and CEO of Arianespace, the French company which manages Ariane 5 launch operations and sales.\n\nThursday's flight notched the Ariane 5's 61st consecutive successful launch.\n\nFor engineers working on the mission's payloads, the launch was just the beginning.\n\n\"It's only the start because the operations are just starting,\" said Arnaud de Rosnay, executive vice president for telecommunications satellites at Airbus Defence and Space, the manufacturer of Measat 3b for the Malaysian telecom company Measat. \"I've just had confirmation that we've received telemetry from the control center in Toulouse, and the early operations of the stellite are working fine.\"\n\nThe 13,000-pound (5,897-kilogram) Measat 3b satellite will fire its orbit-raising propulsion system four times in the next five-to-six days to reach a circular orbit approximately 22,300 miles over the equator. Once there, the spacecraft will extend its power-generating solar panels and antennas to prepare to enter service.\n\nAt that altitude, known as geostationary orbit, the satellite will hover over the same location on Earth.\n\nMeasat 3b should enter service by mid-October parked over the equator at 91.5 degrees east, according to Measat.\n\n\"Measat's successful procurement and launch of the Measat 3b satellite is a great achievement for Measat, for Malaysia's ICT (Information and Communications Technology) infrastructure, and for the Malaysian space industry,\" said YB Dato' Jailani Johari, Malaysia's deputy minister of communication and multimedia, in a press release. \"We trust that Measat will continue to push the boundaries of both business and technology as they look to become the world's leading emerging market satellite operator.\"\n\nOutfitted with 48 Ku-band transponders, Measat 3b will expand direct-to-home television services in Malaysia, Indonesia, India and Australia, serving more than 18 million households, according to Measat.\n\nThe Optus 10 satellite launched by the Ariane 5 rocket is heading for geostationary orbit to support direct television broadcasts, Internet, telephone and data transmission services to Australia, New Zealand and the Antarctic region.\n\nLaunched for the Australian communications firm Optus, the satellite 7,209-pound (3,270-kilogram) spacecraft hosts 24 Ku-band transponders, according to Space Systems/Loral of Palo Alto, Calif., Optus 10's manufacturer.\n\n\"What a great day for Optus,\" said Paul Sheridan, vice president of Optus Satellite. \"We've achieved another major milestone in our rich satellite history.\"\n\nThe flight plan called for Optus 10 to unfurl its solar arrays and begin a series of four maneuvers to circularize its orbit at geostationary altitude. After 20 days of payload testing, the satellite should begin service in October.\n\nOptus 10 is heading for a geostationary slot at 164 degrees east longitude.\n\nNext up for Arianespace is another Ariane 5 launch set for Oct. 16 with the Intelsat DirecTV Latin America 1 satellite and the Arsat 1 payload, the first large communications spacecraft built in Argentina.", "BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Group\n\nAnnouncing the results of a portfolio review, Europe's largest aerospace group signaled a break with previous efforts to diversify into security activities and a halt to investment in defense electronics, in which it lacks the scale of rivals.\n\nEurope's defense industry is struggling as cash-strapped governments cut back on military spending.

The division's top executive said it would sell assets generating 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of revenues. Here are some details on the assets up for sale.\n\nThe U.S. based supplier of fluid valves and environmental controls is among the last vestiges of French industrialist Jean-Luc Lagardere's expansion into the U.S. defence and commercial satellite market, through the 1989 acquisition of the defence and space activities of Fairchild Industries.\n\nLagardere's Matra missiles company sold most of the Fairchild assets in the 1990s and later helped to found EADS, recently renamed Airbus Group. Fairchild Controls was active in the U.S. Space Shuttle programme and was last month named supplier of the year in its category by Airbus's rival Boeing.\n\nIts sale would also sever Airbus's remaining ties with the U.S. KC-46A aerial tanker programme, a $35 billion project to supply the Pentagon with aerial tankers that Airbus lost to Boeing, but for which Fairchild Controls remains a supplier.\n\nOriginally founded in 1977 to support shipbuilding projects for the East German Navy, the company makes cabin training mock-ups and simulators for airlines such as Qatar Airways, which has ordered door trainers for the Airbus A380 and the new A350.\n\nThe firm, which has 150 employees, says it operates a test bed for maritime applications for Europe's Galileo satellite positioning system in the former East German port of Rostock.\n\nAirbus's little-known in-house charter airline specializes in transporting people and freight on demand and training future French military pilots from its base in southern France.\n\nAirbus Group owns 80 percent of Pentastar, a military training and services venture which owns 55 percent of AvDef with UK defence contractor Cobham owning the rest.\n\nIn 2010, Airbus's then defence boss pointed to AvDef as part of its strategy to boost its presence in services. But with a staff of about 40 and revenues reported to be around 15 million euros, it is looking for new growth to cope with defence cuts.\n\nAirbus Defence & Space owns 30 percent of the Munich-based systems and software company, which has 1,600 staff and posted 2013 revenues of 258 million euros. France's Thales also owns 30 percent and a German unit of Northrop Grumman owns 10 percent of the company, which serves the automobile and aerospace industries and the German military.\n\nAirbus Group, then known as EADS, teamed up with German engineering firm ThyssenKrupp to buy the submarine supplier from BAE Systems in 2005. German media speculate France's Thales could launch a fresh approach for Airbus's stake, having lost out in 2005 when the German government reportedly blocked its bid on national security grounds. Former shareholder Rheinmetall has also been cited as a potential suitor for the sonar and torpedo maker, which has around 2,000 employees and revenues of over 400 million euros. Airbus Group is likely to discuss the stake with ThyssenKrupp first, however.\n\nEADS bought the TETRA-based secure radio assets of Nokia in 2005, ending a battle over digital standards with its own TETRAPOL technology and predicting a global market of 10 billion euros over 5 years. The business competes with Motorola to supply users such as police and security forces.

He said it could have a damaging impact on the group's finances, but declined to say how quickly that might happen.\n\nThe strike left many check-in counters empty, days after de Juniac unveiled an ambitious new turnaround plan focusing on the expansion of the company's Transavia budget subsidiary.\n\nBoth sides expressed frustration over the failure to narrow differences over how pilots from the main airline would be recruited to the low-cost operation.

But then things start to look different. Past the cubicles filled with programmers and support staff sits a 140,000-square-foot factory with spotless white concrete floors, bright lighting, surprisingly quiet equipment, and very few human beings.\n\nOpened in 2011, Crosspointe is the kind of factory that makes a good backdrop to a political speech about advanced manufacturing, as President Barack Obama knew when he arrived less than a year later. It's global: the U.S. operations center of a U.K. company, it uses titanium forgings from Scotland, Germany, or the United States; shapes them into fan disks; and, after milling, polishing, and testing, ships them off to England, Germany, or Singapore. Once there, each disk will become one of 10,000 parts in a typical engine.\n\nIt's also highly automated: $1.5 million machines made by DMG Mori Seiki do the initial milling of the disks, following steps directed by Siemens software with a minimum of human interference. On a day in early summer, eight machines were being monitored by three operators. Computer screens in front of the machine displayed instructions in pictures and text, flashing warnings when a part has not met specs or the machine needs to be serviced. Later an automated measurement machine with a probe on the end would spend eight hours inspecting 1,000-plus distinct dimensions of the part. For the next 25 years, Rolls-Royce will keep data on each part, starting with exactly how it was made. Sensors in the engine will track how the engine and its parts are holding up, and maintenance and flight data will be carefully recorded.\n\nIt's not just pristine floors, scarce workers, and a global network that make Crosspointe emblematic of manufacturing today. It's also the ecosystem surrounding the facility. Just down the road is the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing, a research center whose members include Airbus, NASA, and the University of Virginia.\n\nThere, Rolls-Royce staff who know the challenges and details of manufacturing work with researchers and suppliers to improve the factory and its products, says Crosspointe manufacturing executive Lorin Sodell. \"Often a great idea for a new manufacturing process won't ever make it into production because that connection is missing.\"\n\nMost of the advanced machining and other innovative processes in place at Crosspointe were developed and first tested at a similar research center near the company's plant in Sheffield, U.K., called the Advanced Manufacturing Research Center. Sodell is already working with suppliers housed in the Virginia research center to diagnose and quickly address new tooling issues and any other problems that might arise.\n\nTo understand why manufacturing matters, we must lose some misconceptions. First, manufacturing no longer derives its importance primarily from employing large numbers of people. As software drives more of the manufacturing process, and automated machines and robots execute much of it, factories don't need as many workers.\n\nSecond, the idea popularized in the 1990s and 2000s that innovation can happen in one place (say, Silicon Valley) while manufacturing happens in another (such as China) is not broadly sustainable. If all the manufacturing is happening in China, these networks are growing there, meaning eventually all the innovation -- or at least a lot of it -- will be happening there too.\n\nManufacturing will make its most essential economic contribution as an incubator of innovation: the place where new ideas become new products. Thanks to advanced manufacturing technologies, that place can in theory be pretty much anywhere. Robots, software, and sensors work no matter what language is spoken around them. In practice, however, advanced manufacturers thrive best in an ecosystem of suppliers and experienced talent. For this reason, specialized manufacturing networks have taken hold in many regions. Among the success stories highlighted in this report are China's dominance as a manufacturer of consumer electronics, Germany's lead in precision tooling and robotics, the United States' strength in aerospace and car manufacturing, and its role in pushing forward important new manufacturing technologies.\n\nInnovative manufacturing today requires as its base that manufacturers and their suppliers build strong relationships and share knowledge extensively, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nChina's achievement is especially significant. Today, it would be nearly impossible for any other region to replicate the country's manufacturing prowess in electronics or the speed with which its companies can introduce new products, says Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih, a longtime executive at IBM, Eastman Kodak, and other multinational firms who studies the links between manufacturing, product development, and innovation.\n\nIt's not a new idea that manufacturing and innovation are linked. Seventy percent of industrial research and development spending in the U.S. comes from the manufacturing sector. Some have been skeptical, however, that innovation requires manufacturing know-how.\n\nApple, for example, has thrived with a system of designing its products in California but having them assembled in China using digital design and manufacturing instructions. That arrangement, printed on the back of every iPhone, has been popular with investors who appreciate not only Apple's wildly successful products but also its \"asset light\" structure and relatively small workforce. \"Couldn't everyone do what Apple did?\" says MIT professor Suzanne Berger, who participated in a three-year-long university task force that examined manufacturing in hundreds of global companies and produced the book Making in America. \"In a way, the case that motivated our whole inquiry was Apple.\"\n\nApple did not participate in the study, but in time Berger came to see that the company's case was not so black and white -- that even Apple finds links between manufacturing and innovation. Apple owns the automated production machines in the Chinese factories that manufacture its products. Many California-\u00adbased Apple engineers spend at least 50 percent of their time in China as new products are launched, she learned.\n\nOne engineer explained to Berger that it was critical to be on the ground in China for two reasons: to see what problems arose when the products prototyped in the U.S. hit large-scale production, and to \"understand where I left too much on the table, where I could have pushed farther with the design.\"\n\nAfter three years of study, Berger is a believer that the United States must continue to manufacture if it hopes to be an innovation leader. She finds evidence that the manufacturing communities for emerging high-tech sectors such as solar and wind energy and batteries are already being built outside the country in places where technical expertise, manufacturing skills, and even plant layouts are quickly pulling ahead.\n\nWithout manufacturing, \"we lose capabilities in the workforce,\" says Harvard's Shih. \"It limits what you are able to do down the line.\"", "Bangalore-based Dynamatic Technologies is increasingly becoming the preferred supplier of aerospace parts and assemblies to global aviation industry including giants such as Airbus, Boeing and Bell Helicopter. The company that many experts call the \"Infosys of aerospace manufacturing\" was recently promoted as a tier-1 global vendor for these companies and orders have been pouring in. Its order book for aerospace products has tripled to about Rs 6,000 crore since the beginning of 2014. These orders have to be executed over the next decade.\n\nEuropean aircraft maker Airbus, which has placed orders worth Rs 1,800 crore with Dynamatic, has worked closely with the company for the past eight years. \"We are expanding our Airbus 320 and Airbus 350 production. With increasing maturity of Dynamatic, we include it among the popular candidates. They have been manufacturing one of the most complicated parts for us and have delivered all our orders on time,\" said Airbus India CEO Srinivas Dwarkanath.\n\nThe global aviation companies decided to outsource manufacturing in 2006 and identified India as a potential destination. Dynamatic's CEO and managing director Udayant Malhoutra, who was working closely with HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics) then, was quick to see the opportunity and got in touch with these firms.\n\n\"Dynamatic was quite smart about it,\" said Pratyush Kumar, India head of American firm Boeing. \"They have been innovative and quick to get into the game, and have been successful. They recognise manual assembly and are very savvy and well-informed about how global aviation industry functions.\" He added, \"With high cost, quality and delivery efficiencies we are keenly looking at Indian suppliers. Their success is our success.\"\n\nDynamatic is the only tier-1 supplier from India, which is being seen as an outsourcing destination by global majors.\n\nIt manufactures primarily flap track beams, a flight critical component instrumental in controlling the speed, direction and balance of the aircraft, for Airbus and helicopter parts for Boeing and Bell.\n\n\"Developing plane parts is an art, like manufacturing a Swiss watch,\" said Malhoutra, \"It's all handmade. It's not a business where you set up capacities and start manufacturing. We have invested several years and a lot of money in developing these skills and are now past the learning curve.\"\n\nTata and Mahindra Aerospace are among the other domestic private sector companies in this sector, but they are much smaller than Dynamatic, which also makes airframe structures for Indian Air Force aircraft such as the Sukhoi 30MKI and Lakshya. It is a strong contender for the offset orders that can come up in aerospace as part of defence orders. The defence ministry has already placed orders worth about $4.3 billion or Rs 26,000 crore. It is expected that orders worth $24 billion will flow from the aerospace and defence segments.\n\nThe aerospace business contributed just 15% to the company's total revenues in 2013-14, but its share in operating profit was as much as 60%. The revenues from the aerospace segment are likely to grow, too, promising a jump in the company's profits.", "(CNN) -- Sure, first class sounds swank, but when you're paying a premium of several thousand dollars a ticket, it can be hard to justify the added expense.\n\nIn an effort to really make it \"worth it,\" airlines have started offering passengers everything from on-board apartments (yes, really) to post-boarding limo rentals and private jet access.\n\nWe've broken down the top first-class perks to see which carriers offer the best value.\n\nEtihad\n\nCome December, the Abu Dhabi-based airline is taking luxury a step further with the launch of Residence Class on its Airbus A380 and Boeing B787 Dreamliner aircraft.\n\nWealthy customers can enjoy three-room apartments while in the air.\n\nThese suites -- clocking in at around $40,000 for a round-trip flight from Abu Dhabi to London -- will feature a private bedroom, a living room and en suite shower.\n\nPassengers looking for a slightly scaled down experience can book a First Apartment -- a private suite with a full-length bed, separate reclining ottoman and access to a bathroom with shower.\n\nPassengers will get their own Savoy Academy-trained butler, concierge, a chauffeur to get them to and from the airport and a private chef.\n\nWhile guests can order off the a la carte menu, they can also request personalized dishes anytime.\n\nMORE: Etihad Airways unveils world's most luxurious passenger jets\n\nEmirates\n\nEmirates has announced similar plans to launch a private, on-board residence, though the details have yet to be released.\n\nStill, the Dubai airline has long been at the forefront of in-flight luxury.\n\nIn 2008, Emirates was the first carrier to install first-class cabins with sliding doors for privacy on their Airbus A380s, A340-500s and on most Boeing 777s.\n\nCabins come with a personal minibar, adjustable lighting, private vanity table, mirror and wardrobe.\n\nGuests can avail themselves of a 25-minute \"shower spa\" treatment (though actual shower time is limited to five minutes).\n\nThere's also turndown service, where cabin crew convert the seat into a bed with a real mattress.\n\nAnd of course there's the award-winning food.\n\nIn first class, Emirates focuses on regional menus.\n\nPassengers can expect items like Iranian caviar or stir-fried lobster in black bean sauce.\n\nAir France\n\nPassengers craving an extra level of comfort can book Air France's new La Premiere cabin.\n\nThese mini-suites -- available on the carrier's long-haul Boeing 777-300 aircraft -- feature lie-flat seats that adapt to each passenger's morphology, a 24-inch HD screen (one of the largest available on board), a private wardrobe and an adjustable privacy curtain.\n\nThere's a reclining ottoman, so guests from other parts of the cabin can visit.\n\nCome nighttime, cabin crew will outfit the seat with a mattress and linens from the Sofitel range.\n\nAir France has also teamed with an army of Michelin-rated chefs to design its new La Premiere menu.

perks, however, is access to the Lufthansa private jet.\n\nGranted, the extra service isn't included, but for travelers wishing to hit up a second -- perhaps more remote -- location, the jet offers a seamless means of transport, minus the rigmarole of layovers.\n\nLufthansa also tapped a few Michelin-starred chefs to design its in-flight menus, complete with caviar service.\n\nThe award-winning wine program (Vinothek Discoveries) offers a rotation of vintages handpicked by sommelier world champion Markus Del Monego.\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nIn 2012, Singapore launched suites aboard its new A380 aircraft.\n\nEach cabin features sliding doors and window blinds for maximum privacy.\n\nEschewing the lie-back seat, the carrier opted instead for a standalone bed that can accommodate two people.\n\nThe cabins also come with a 23-inch screen and USB and HDMI ports, enabling travelers to plug in their own devices.\n\nSingapore's Book the Cook service lets passengers pre-order one of more than 60 dishes.\n\nSome of its more off-the-cuff items include kyo-kaiseki -- a traditional, bespoke Japanese tasting menu, and wagyu sirloin.\n\nSingapore also offers an extensive selection of champagne, grand cru red burgundy and second growth Bordeaux.\n\nCathay Pacific\n\nLast year, Cathay Pacific brushed up its first-class cabins with the help of British architecture firm Foster +

adjust the seat and control the lighting.\n\nPassengers are also given BOSE headphones to better enjoy the in-flight entertainment.\n\nThe bedding has also been improved and passengers are given pajamas from Hong Kong label PYE.\n\nThe Hong Kong carrier also recently partnered with the Mandarin Oriental Hotel to bring five-star dining to the air.\n\nFirst-class passengers traveling from Hong Kong to London, for example, will be plied with the likes of foie gras, truffles and chicken and beef accompanied by crab meat and caviar.\n\nJapan Airlines has introduced a number of minimalist, first class suites on a handful of routes.\n\nThese cubicles feature wood grain interiors and air-weave pillows that act as a mattress when the seat is in lie-flat mode -- that's soft on one side and

scenic beach trail, more than 5,000 miles from Southern California, I marveled at the aquamarine waters of the Bay of Biscay and the historic Phare des Baleines lighthouse.\n\nAnother day, another place, a local vintner shared a glass of his wine with me within the fortress walls of a 650-year-old San Clemente by the sea, in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy.\n\nThose were the bookends of my summer, 2014. I spent the first week of June visiting Saint-Clement des Baleines, France. Over the last week of August, I took in San Clemente, Italy.\n\nAs I might say in my hometown of San Clemente, I collect San Clementes. I've been to six. Others populate my bucket list.\n\nWHERE'S THE BEACH?\n\nUnlike its namesake in California, Italy's San Clemente is not a beach town - it's 5 miles inland from the Adriatic Sea. It isn't much of a stretch to call it \"Italian village by the Sea\" as a spinoff on \"Spanish Village by the Sea,\" Orange County's San Clemente.\n\nItaly's historic village sits atop a knoll surrounded by fortress walls that command a view of the sea. Where the downtown street in San Clemente, Calif., is Avenida Del Mar (Avenue of the Sea), San Clemente, Italy, invites you to stroll its Via del Castello, a reference to its castle-like walls.\n\nWalls were common in medieval times. On a tourist map of Rimini Province, walled villages dot the landscape. San Clemente evidently avoided warfare and enjoyed a peaceful evolution under domain of the Malatesta family, the rule of Venice, rule of the Vatican, a Napoleonic period and the the rule of Italy after national unification, townspeople told me.\n\nSEEING THE LIGHT\n\nIn France, Saint-Clement des Baleines (San Clemente of the Whales) is surrounded on two sides by water. It's the southwest corner of an island, Ile de Re, that draws throngs of summer tourists. A top attraction is San Clemente's Phare des Baleines lighthouse, completed in 1854 to replace a shorter one that dates to 1682 and still stands. A spiral staircase of 257 steps ascends to the top of the big one, 187 feet up.\n\nThe pleasant island is flat, populated by villages, vacation rentals and campgrounds. Bicycle trails lead past vineyards, salt flats, beaches and a nature reserve.\n\nI reached the lighthouse on foot from downtown. There's no San Clemente Pier, no lifeguard headquarters with clock tower along this beach trail as in California. The lighthouse is the landmark. Just as San Clemente's beach trail is perched atop railroad rocks, Saint-Clement's sits atop ramparts protecting it from the \"Savage Coast.\"\n\nOn the day I walked it, the \"savage\" coastal waters of the Atlantic were on their best behavior - placid, gorgeously blue-green and deliciously warm.\n\nHOW I FOUND THEM\n\nCalifornia's San Clemente's sister city, San Clemente del Tuyu, Argentina, inspired my search. It's a fun beach town with a fishing pier, surf, fishing tournaments, hot springs, a historic lighthouse, packed beaches and festive summer evenings. It's home to Mundo Marino, South America's Sea World.\n\nIt took me five months to reach the Argentine sister city on my first visit in 1974. I traveled over land across Central and South America. During a month exploring Ecuador, I surmised Ecuador might have a San Clemente, so I asked.\n\nThe dot on the map in the Quito tourist office didn't prove easy to reach. A dusty ride in an open-air bus got me there, rewarding me with a sleepy beach town that so entranced me, I revisited it in 2012. Oh, and I've revisited my town's charming Argentine sister city four times.\n\nOn a 1976 Eurailpass fling across Europe, I inquired in Madrid and found San Clemente, Spain. It was an easy bus ride. A local family, the Peramos, showed me around this village that dates to around 1100 and has splendid architecture from the 1400s and 1500s. I revisited in January 2014. I had hoped to surprise Dr. Braulio Peramo, a San Clemente native, only to learn he was out of the country.\n\nOn the 1976 trip, I also found San Clemente, Italy. Saint-Clement des Baleines came to me during a recent Web search that produced a dizzying number of Saint-Clements in France. I picked the one that had a beach.\n\nSan Clemente, Mexico, is two to three hours outside Guadalajara by bus, discovered via Web search. As I later wrote, it's a delightful town with colonial roots and a landmark hacienda said to date back 400 years.\n\nFun facts, Italy\n\nLoving wine: San Clemente, Rimini, has a music and wine festival the third Sunday of July, coinciding with our San Clemente's yearly ocean festival. Actually, the Note di Vino festival runs three successive Sundays.\n\nFavorite son: Giustiniano Villa, social poet (1842-1919), is San Clemente's favorite son, celebrated with a monument and displays several of his literary works. One is about Italian migration to America.\n\nPopulation: About 500 in and around the historic walls. The outlying village has spread out, resulting in an overall population of 5,000.\n\nTraffic signals: I saw one. The main road is so narrow, summiting the hill, that traffic must stop on one side to let the other side pass.\n\nIndustries: Wine, olive oil, ceramic tiles\n\nTaste of SC: Locals are proud that Gino Angelini, a native of San Clemente and award-winning chef, has a Los Angeles restaurant, Angelini Osteria. You needn't fly to Rome for a taste of the town.\n\nAmbiance: Downtown Saint-Clement des Baleines remains one of the most quiet, laid-back villages on Ile de Re, despite swarms of tourists who visit the town's outlying lighthouse, maritime museum and collection of souvenir shops and restaurants.\n\nPopulation: About 700 core residents, though the population swells as summer vacation rentals, inns and campgrounds fill.\n\nPresidential: Just as President Richard Nixon hosted world leaders in San Clemente, Calif., in the 1970s, Saint-Clement hosted French President Francois Mitterand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1992. During a summit, they dined at Saint-Clement's esteemed downtown restaurant, Le Chat Botte.\n\nMovie scene: Ile de Re was occupied by German forces during World War II. One of Saint-Clement's beaches, La Conche, served as a movie set for the 1960s D-Day movie \"The Longest Day.\"\n\nLoving wine: Ile de Re has its own local wines, Vignerons de Ile de Re, and homegrown beers, Biere de Re.\n\nSource: Locals, tourist office, observations, souvenir book by Herve Roques", "Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), developed a geared turbofan that relies on a gearbox and lets the front fan operate at a different speed than the rest of the engine, while on GE's traditionally configured engines the fans run at the same speed.\n\nSpeaking at a Morgan Stanley investor conference, GE Chief Technology Officer Mark Little said the company had \"considered a geared approach ... and we chose very consciously not to take that approach.\"\n\n\"Some other application someday, maybe, but not for this one,\" Little said at the conference in Dana Point, California, that was broadcast over the Internet.\n\nThrough its joint venture called CFM with France's Safran (SAF.PA), GE is competing against Pratt for airline and other customers that choose Airbus' (AIR.PA) new A320neo single-aisle plane.

(PAL) after paying as much as $1.3 billion to diversified conglomerate San Miguel Corp. (SMC).\n\nThe Tan Group celebrated the successful buyback by holding a party at the headquarters of Philippine National Bank (PNB) on Macapagal Boulevard in Pasay City.\n\nIn his message, Tan said he was happy to take back full control of the national flag carrier, which he described as \"special\" to him.\n\n\"PAL is more than an airline company for me. It goes beyond investing - it is like family.

Tan serves as chairman of PAL while SMC president Ramon Ang is president and chief operating officer.\n\nFormer PAL president Jaime Bautista, who served as chief negotiator for the Tan Group during the talks, has been appointed general manager of the airline.\n\n\"The first step is to go back and review where we stand and plot a new direction,\" Bautista said.\n\nThe source added that Ang is expected to remain PAL president and COO at least for another month or during a transition period.\n\nIn April 2012, SMC's wholly owned subsidiary San Miguel Equity Investments Inc. (SMEII) acquired a 49-percent equity interest in Trustmark Holdings Corp. for $500 million. Trustmark owns 97.71 percent of PAL Holdings, which in turn owns 84.67 percent of PAL through PR Holdings Inc.\n\nWith SMC on board, PAL embarked on a massive fleet renewal program involving the acquisition of 100 brand new aircraft.\n\nPAL entered into its first purchase agreement with Airbus for a firm order of 44 A320 aircraft with options for 20 A321 NEO aircraft for delivery in fiscal years 2014 to 2020.\n\nIt also signed a second purchase agreement for a firm order of 10 A330-300 and options for another 10 aircraft for delivery in fiscal years 2014 to 2016.\n\nHowever, PAL and Airbus agreed to a contract amendment last March wherein the number of orders of A330-300 aircraft would be reduced to 15 instead of 20.\n\nIt also agreed to acquire eight A321 NEO. The airline has until 2017 to exercise its right to purchase four A321 NEO aircraft.\n\nAs of end-June, PAL has received a total of 17 aircraft from Airbus, including 10 A330 and seven A321. The fleet of the PAL Group, including PAL Express, stood at 85 as of end-June.\n\nWith the Tan Group back at the helm, it is not clear whether PAL would pursue the ambitious fleet renewal program or put the aircraft orders on review.\n\nHowever, the Tan Group is looking at taking in Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways as partner for a 40-percent stake in the national flag carrier.\n\nAsia's oldest airline is set to mount flights to New York via Vancouver in March next year instead of the original schedule of October as the US Federal Aviation Administration upgraded the aviation security rating of the Philippines back to Category 1 from Category 2 last April.\n\nIt is also looking at flying to other major cities in the US including Florida, San Diego and Chicago, as well as other cities in Europe such as Paris, Rome and Amsterdam after mounting direct flights to London last November after the European Union lifted the ban imposed on Philippine carriers.\n\nPAL booked a net income of P1.49 billion in the second quarter of the year from a net loss of P1.08 billion in the same quarter last year.", "(Reuters) - General Electric Co\n\nPratt, part of United Technologies Corp\n\nSpeaking at a Morgan Stanley investor conference, GE Chief Technology Officer Mark Little said the company had \"considered a geared approach ... and we chose very consciously not to take that approach.\"\n\n\"Some other application someday, maybe, but not for this one,\" Little said at the conference in Dana Point, California, that was broadcast over the Internet.\n\nThrough its joint venture called CFM with France's Safran\n\nCFM's LEAP, among other improvements, uses new materials designed to reduce weight and add durability.\n\n\"We thought that the addition of the extra component would add reliability and weight challenges, and durability challenges that we could avoid by going the path we went,\" Little said.\n\n\"We like the bet that we've made,\" Little said.\n\nIn response to Little's comments, Pratt & Whitney spokeswoman Sara Banda said: \"We are confident in our PurePower Geared Turbofan engine technology and this is not just us saying this,\" noting that in addition to Airbus, four other aircraft makers have selected the GTF, including Embraer\n\nPratt has completed more than 10,000 hours of testing for the GTF engine family, Banda said in an email, after 20 years of research and $1 billion invested into developing the engine.\n\nBarry Eccleston, president of Airbus Americas Inc, told the Reuters Aerospace and Defense summit last week that of A320neo customers, so far about one-third have chosen the LEAP, one-third have selected the GTF, while one-third remain undecided.\n\nPratt has had a smaller presence among commercial engines in recent years, so the GTF engine is its bid to return to prominence.

The only problem with Arsenal is when they meet top teams, they don't seem to have the consistent level of mental strength to get through it.\"\n\nChelsea have made a strong start to the season in the Premier League and Scholes thinks the domestic title might be Jose Mourinho's priority.\n\nHe said: \"Whilst The Champions League is the ultimate trophy for any club team, I believe Chelsea's main objective is winning the Premier League this season.\n\n\"If you ask Jose Mourinho what you'd rather win now, I think the answer would be the Premier League.\"\n\nUnited failed to qualify for the Champions League this season and, despite their stature, Scholes is not sure the competition will miss his former club.\n\nHe said: \"Maybe, but there's still a lot of major clubs in it.\n\n\"Let's just hope it's one year, you have to earn the right to be in it and they haven't done that for this season.\"", "A MERE 14 weeks after the amazing Angel Di Maria-inspired comeback in Lisbon, Real Madrid welcome the visit of FC Basel on Wednesday morning (EST) to kick off their UEFA Champions League title defence.\n\nAnd the Swiss side must fancy their chances considering Real's ordinary start to the season.\n\nWith Di Maria now plying his trade in England, Real have looked far from the dominant side that beat arch rivals Atletico 4-1 in front of 60,000 fans at the Estadio da Luz back in May.\n\nBut with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez - and the wisdom and confidence of Carlo Ancelotti - they are not to be underestimated and will still start favourites.\n\nThe opening round of matches in the final 32 features some tasty match-ups, none more so than the three Premier League v Bundesliga showdowns.\n\nThe pick of those looks to be Manchester City's visit to the Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich, although Arsenal's trip to Dortmund on Thursday morning (EST) could rival it.\n\nIt's a year-long celebration of the best club football in the world. Qualifying rounds actually began when the World Cup was still on in early July. Those still standing are now among the big guns and will play in the group matches - an elongated round of 32, if you like. The winners and runners up from the eight groups then progress through to the round 16. From then on it's home and away sudden death right through to the one-off final.\n\nWith no World Cup next year, there doesn't seem to be a rush to actually play the decider. Set your calendars for June 6 - which is two weeks later than 2014 - and the venue is the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\n\nFor the first time since the 2001-2002 season Real Madrid took the title. They beat crosstown rivals Atletico 4-1 after extra time in a game they were 1-0 down until the 89th minute.\n\nWell, no-one from the very first qualifier. Belarussian side BATE Borisov, Swedes Malmo and Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets are the only ones left from the second round of qualifying. There are four teams left from Germany, Spain and England, three from Portugal, two from Italy, France and Russia and one each from Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nWhile upsets are not uncommon in the group stages, the final rarely produces a shock winner. The cream almost always rises to the top. Probably the biggest shock of recent seasons was Porto's success in 2003-2004 when they beat Monaco 3-0. Since then the winner has come from England, Spain, Italy or Germany.\n\nIt's been five long seasons but Liverpool are again among the elite. European nights at Anfield have a big place in Liverpool's history, from the late 1970s and early '80s when the club was the most successful on the continent to the period from 2005-07 when Liverpool won one Champions League final and reached another.\n\nUnder previous coach Antonio Conte, Juventus failed to reproduce their dominant domestic form in Europe so Massimiliano Allegri will know the importance of beginning with a win against Malmo in Turin. The Italian champions, who will be without injured midfielder Arturo Vidal, are fresh from beating Udinese 2-0 on Saturday.\n\nSwedish champions Malmo were beaten European Cup finalists in 1979, losing to Nottingham Forest, but this is their first appearance in the Champions League group stage. Age Hareide's side won three qualifying ties to get here.\n\nSpanish champions and last season's Champions League runners-up Atletico begin their campaign away to the Greek titleholders at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium. Atletico will be buoyed by avenging their 4-1 defeat to Real Madrid in May's final in Lisbon by winning 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu over the weekend.\n\nArda Turan was the matchwinner at the Bernabeu and is expected to start for the first time this season, while Italian international Alessio Cerci could make his debut. Atletico coach Diego Simeone serves a one-game European touchline ban for storming onto the pitch to confront Real defender Raphael Varane towards the end of the Champions League final. Olympiakos, who reached the last 16 last season under former Real Madrid and Spain star Michel, are unbeaten so far this season.\n\nFive-time European champions Liverpool mark their return to the Champions League for the first time since 2009 at home to the Bulgarian champions, who are making their group stage debut. Daniel Sturridge is injured for Brendan Rodgers's side but Raheem Sterling will return to the line-up after being rested for the 1-0 home loss to Aston Villa.\n\nLudogorets produced the sensation of the play-off round by beating Steaua Bucharest 6-5 on penalties, with Romanian defender Cosmin Moti saving two spot-kicks after goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov had been sent off. Stoyanov will therefore be suspended for the trip to Anfield.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's reigning European champions will be looking forward to the distraction of the Champions League after a poor start to the season domestically, with Saturday's 2-1 loss to Atletico in the Madrid derby their second in three games in La Liga. Ancelotti has yet to find a balance to his side following the summer arrivals of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez, while goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas's place in the team has been the subject of intense scrutiny.\n\nSwiss champions Basel were knocked out in the group stage last season but did beat Chelsea home and away. Since then, Portuguese Paulo Sousa has replaced Murat Yakin as coach.\n\nPortuguese champions Benfica, last season's beaten Europa League finalists, face a familiar foe as Zenit St Petersburg head to Lisbon coached by Andre Villas-Boas. The Portuguese was a nemesis for Benfica during his highly successful season in charge of Porto in 2010/11 and he has enjoyed a fine start to this campaign with Zenit, winning 10 games in a row in all competitions. Benfica are also undefeated so far this season, the Brazilian Talisca scoring a hat-trick in the 5-0 win at Vitoria Setubal.\n\nWhen they finished second in Ligue 1 last season, Monaco looked capable of going on to be a force to be reckoned with in Europe, but James Rodriguez, Radamel Falcao and other stars left over the summer without being replaced and Leonardo Jardim's side are in the relegation zone at home ahead of their meeting with early Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen. Roger Schmidt's visitors are without captain Simon Rolfes for the trip to the principality but Lars Bender is fit again and South Korea's Heung-Min Son is likely to start after scoring as a substitute in Friday's 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen.\n\nDortmund and Arsenal meet in the Champions League for the second season running. Last time around, the German giants won 2-1 in London, but an Aaron Ramsey goal handed the Gunners a 1-0 victory at the Signal Iduna Park. Arsene Wenger's side will be looking for a repeat performance here that would extend their unbeaten start to the campaign, although they must do without the injured Mathieu Debuchy. Jurgen Klopp's home side beat Freiburg 3-1 in the Bundesliga on Saturday with Shinji Kagawa scoring on his first appearance since returning to the club from Manchester United. They will need the Japanese star to perform again, especially with numerous players currently missing, including Marco Reus and captain Mats Hummels.\n\nTurkish giants Galatasaray entertain Anderlecht looking for a better start to this season's Champions League than 12 months ago, when they were thumped 6-1 by Real Madrid in Istanbul. Now coached by former Italy boss Cesare Prandelli, Gala should do better against Anderlecht, even if the Belgian champions are so far unbeaten this season.

Qualifying rounds actually began when the World Cup was still on in early July. Those still standing are now among the big guns and will play in the group matches - an elongated round of 32, if you like. The winners and runners up from the eight groups then progress through to the round 16. From then on it's home and away sudden death right through to the one-off final.\n\nWith no World Cup next year, there doesn't seem to be a rush to actually play the decider. Set your calendars for June 6 - which is two weeks later than 2014 - and the venue is the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\n\nFor the first time since the 2001-2002 season Real Madrid took the title. They beat crosstown rivals Atletico 4-1 after extra time in a game they were 1-0 down until the 89th minute.\n\nWell, no-one from the very first qualifier. Belarussian side BATE Borisov, Swedes Malmo and Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets are the only ones left from the second round of qualifying. There are four teams left from Germany, Spain and England, three from Portugal, two from Italy, France and Russia and one each from Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nWhile upsets are not uncommon in the group stages, the final rarely produces a shock winner. The cream almost always rises to the top. Probably the biggest shock of recent seasons was Porto's success in 2003-2004 when they beat Monaco 3-0. Since then the winner has come from England, Spain, Italy or Germany.\n\nIt's been five long seasons but Liverpool are again among the elite. European nights at Anfield have a big place in Liverpool's history, from the late 1970s and early '80s when the club was the most successful on the continent to the period from 2005-07 when Liverpool won one Champions League final and reached another.\n\nUnder previous coach Antonio Conte, Juventus failed to reproduce their dominant domestic form in Europe so Massimiliano Allegri will know the importance of beginning with a win against Malmo in Turin. The Italian champions, who will be without injured midfielder Arturo Vidal, are fresh from beating Udinese 2-0 on Saturday.\n\nSwedish champions Malmo were beaten European Cup finalists in 1979, losing to Nottingham Forest, but this is their first appearance in the Champions League group stage. Age Hareide's side won three qualifying ties to get here.\n\nSpanish champions and last season's Champions League runners-up Atletico begin their campaign away to the Greek titleholders at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium. Atletico will be buoyed by avenging their 4-1 defeat to Real Madrid in May's final in Lisbon by winning 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu over the weekend.\n\nArda Turan was the matchwinner at the Bernabeu and is expected to start for the first time this season, while Italian international Alessio Cerci could make his debut. Atletico coach Diego Simeone serves a one-game European touchline ban for storming onto the pitch to confront Real defender Raphael Varane towards the end of the Champions League final. Olympiakos, who reached the last 16 last season under former Real Madrid and Spain star Michel, are unbeaten so far this season.\n\nFive-time European champions Liverpool mark their return to the Champions League for the first time since 2009 at home to the Bulgarian champions, who are making their group stage debut. Daniel Sturridge is injured for Brendan Rodgers's side but Raheem Sterling will return to the line-up after being rested for the 1-0 home loss to Aston Villa.\n\nLudogorets produced the sensation of the play-off round by beating Steaua Bucharest 6-5 on penalties, with Romanian defender Cosmin Moti saving two spot-kicks after goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov had been sent off. Stoyanov will therefore be suspended for the trip to Anfield.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's reigning European champions will be looking forward to the distraction of the Champions League after a poor start to the season domestically, with Saturday's 2-1 loss to Atletico in the Madrid derby their second in three games in La Liga. Ancelotti has yet to find a balance to his side following the summer arrivals of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez, while goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas's place in the team has been the subject of intense scrutiny.\n\nSwiss champions Basel were knocked out in the group stage last season but did beat Chelsea home and away. Since then, Portuguese Paulo Sousa has replaced Murat Yakin as coach.\n\nPortuguese champions Benfica, last season's beaten Europa League finalists, face a familiar foe as Zenit St Petersburg head to Lisbon coached by Andre Villas-Boas. The Portuguese was a nemesis for Benfica during his highly successful season in charge of Porto in 2010/11 and he has enjoyed a fine start to this campaign with Zenit, winning 10 games in a row in all competitions. Benfica are also undefeated so far this season, the Brazilian Talisca scoring a hat-trick in the 5-0 win at Vitoria Setubal.\n\nWhen they finished second in Ligue 1 last season, Monaco looked capable of going on to be a force to be reckoned with in Europe, but James Rodriguez, Radamel Falcao and other stars left over the summer without being replaced and Leonardo Jardim's side are in the relegation zone at home ahead of their meeting with early Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen. Roger Schmidt's visitors are without captain Simon Rolfes for the trip to the principality but Lars Bender is fit again and South Korea's Heung-Min Son is likely to start after scoring as a substitute in Friday's 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen.\n\nDortmund and Arsenal meet in the Champions League for the second season running. Last time around, the German giants won 2-1 in London, but an Aaron Ramsey goal handed the Gunners a 1-0 victory at the Signal Iduna Park. Arsene Wenger's side will be looking for a repeat performance here that would extend their unbeaten start to the campaign, although they must do without the injured Mathieu Debuchy. Jurgen Klopp's home side beat Freiburg 3-1 in the Bundesliga on Saturday with Shinji Kagawa scoring on his first appearance since returning to the club from Manchester United. They will need the Japanese star to perform again, especially with numerous players currently missing, including Marco Reus and captain Mats Hummels.\n\nTurkish giants Galatasaray entertain Anderlecht looking for a better start to this season's Champions League than 12 months ago, when they were thumped 6-1 by Real Madrid in Istanbul. Now coached by former Italy boss Cesare Prandelli, Gala should do better against Anderlecht, even if the Belgian champions are so far unbeaten this season. They have finished bottom in their last seven group stage campaigns.", "Franck Rib\u00e9ry has returned from injury in time for Bayern Munich's Champions League clash with Manchester City. Reuters\n\nNow familiar foes Bayern Munich and Manchester City kick off their Champions League campaigns with a heavyweight clash at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. Having never previously met in a competitive match, the sides will now be facing off in the group phase for the third time in four seasons.\n\nThe frequency of those meetings is a testament to Manchester City's rapid rise, but also their struggles to break into the true European elite. Last season was the first in which City succeeded in getting out of the group phase, but even a 3-2 win at the Allianz Arena wasn't enough to ensure top spot in their group and a more favorable draw in the last 16. In their first ever knockout tie in Europe's top competition, the might of Barcelona were the opponents and City were sent packing. While the club has now won two Premier League titles in three seasons to establish themselves as a true force at home, the club's mega-rich Abu Dhabi owners now surely crave the prestige and notoriety of being a regular at the sharp end of the Champions League and, indeed, taking home the most prestigious trophy in club soccer.\n\nBut before they can think about doing that, Manchester City will again have to negotiate a treacherous group. Not only must they face Bayern, the champions of 2013, but also a rejuvenated Roma side, which finished second in Serie A last season. Two matches against Bayern will not just be chances to show that they can now mix it with Europe's best, but potentially pivotal opportunities to gain points.\n\nWhen the two sides met at the Etihad last October, City looked very much the European novices up against continental heavyweights. In truth, a 3-1 defeat flattered the hosts as Manuel Pellegrini got his tactics badly wrong in his first real European test since taking charge. The decision to go with two strikers on that occasion left City horribly open and Bayern, in the early days of Pep Guardiola, looked a good bet to become the first team to retain the European Cup in the Champions League era.\n\nA similar scenario appeared on the cards in Munich in December. Bayern led 2-0 in a game to decide which team would progress to the last 16 as group winners. But City, this time with a reinforced midfield and just one striker, rebounded superbly and a 3-2 win was only tarnished by the fact that, unbeknownst to Pellegrini, they needed just one more goal to take top spot.\n\nHaving sold Alvaro Negredo on transfer deadline day and with Stevan Jovetic disappointingly injured once more after a fine start to the season, it seems highly likely that Pellegrini will opt just one striker when City return to the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. The Chilean has suffered a blow, though, with the man brought in this summer to shore up the midfield, Fernando, ruled out through injury. Without the former Porto player, as well as Yaya Toure, on Saturday, City struggled to control the midfield and could only draw 2-2 with Arsenal. Although Fernando remains absent, Toure should return to take the place of Frank Lampard alongside Fernandinho.\n\nLast December, few read much into what was just Bayern's third defeat of 2013.Yet it turned into a precursor for the defensive failings that would be briefly shown up by Arsenal and Manchester United and then crudely exposed by Real Madrid in an emphatic defeat for the holders in the semifinals. While City may still need to prove themselves on the European stage, Bayern will be eager to show that they have put that major disappointment behind them.\n\nOne of Guardiola's plans to overcome that vulnerability was apparently to switch to a three-man backline. That idea, however, was quickly undermined by a serious knee injury to Javi Martinez. And their defensive options have now been weakened further by yet another injury cruelly suffered by Holger Badstuber, who had just returned after more than 18 months out injured. It could mean that, against Manchester City, there will be a first appearance in a Bayern shirt for the man signed from Roma last month, Mehdi Benatia.\n\nAnother late-transfer-window arrival Xabi Alonso has already settled seamlessly into the heart of the Bayern team and played a starring role in a 2-0 win over Stuttgart on Saturday. His early performances are a particular boon to Guardiola, given that he is without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thiago Alcantara and Rafinha through injury. Arjen Robben is also a doubt for Wednesday, although Franck Rib\u00e9ry made his return from injury and marked it with the second goal against Stuttgart.\n\nPrediction: Neither side has enjoyed an ideal start to the season, and also have key injuries. Bayern appear to still be struggling with something of a World Cup hangover, while City, too, have been impacted by the tournament in Brazil, with Sergio Aguero still not up to full speed. Wednesday's clash then may not be the best of indicators for how each will fare in Europe going forward this season. City should certainly be competitive, with David Silva in fine form and likely to be handed a central playmaking role. Behind him, though, the loss of Fernando to balance the attacking instincts of Toure is a significant loss. Bayern, with their incredible strength in depth, may just emerge with a narrow win.\n\nBayern Munich 2-1 Manchester City\n\nKickoff time: 2.45 p.m. EDT\n\nTV channel: Fox Sports 1\n\nLive stream: Fox Sports Go, Fox Soccer 2Go (via free trial)\n\nShare this article Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google + More", "Rio Ferdinand might struggle to convince the majority of coaches in modern elite sport that banning chips the night before a game amounted to a catastrophic error of judgment.\n\nBut in his new autobiography the former Manchester United defender presents an aversion to deep fried potatoes as one of a number of reasons why David Moyes failed to last beyond 10 months as the successor to Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nSome might point to Ferdinand as one of a number of senior players who happened to be past their best when Moyes took charge at Old Trafford in July last year. There is no denying Moyes was presented with a huge rebuilding job that is only now being addressed by Louis van Gaal with a massive transfer outlay approaching \u00a3200million.\n\nYou can like our Manchester United Facebook page here\n\nMoyes would not deny he made mistakes either. Indeed he admitted as much in the interview he gave to Sportsmail; the first since his brutal dismissal on April 22.\n\nBut Ferdinand gives his own, fairly detailed view of the Moyes tenure in the book, #2Sides, being serialised in The Sun.\n\nThe 35-year-old defender, who moved to QPR during the summer, does recognise that Moyes was 'unlucky'. He also says he could not fault his desire to succeed. 'He was a genuine guy and no one could have worked harder,' he writes.\n\nBut Ferdinand thought Moyes made a number of key mistakes, among them the banning of what had long been part of a traditional pre-match meal. He said it was 'a ritual' to have 'low-fat chips the night before a game'.\n\nFerdinand said the United players 'loved' their chips but within a week of becoming manager Moyes had banned them 'for no good reason'. 'All the lads were p****d off,' complains Ferdinand. He says the moment Moyes left and Ryan Giggs took temporary charge, chips returned to the menu.\n\nMoyes believed in going for a pre-match team walk. Ferdinand said this was anathema to the players. 'When lots of little things start changing its destabilising,' he said.\n\nIn his interview with Sportsmail, Moyes accepted that in hindsight he might have taken 'a slightly different approach'. At the same time he conceded methods that proved successful at Everton perhaps did not work as well at United. But he insisted he did not go in and make wholesale changes. 'I didn't want to change anything immediately,' he said last month. 'I wanted to take my time working out what I thought was needed.' He felt he was 'not given time to succeed or fail', but praised the players for their work ethic. 'They were fantastic,' he said.\n\nFerdinand is not quite so generous towards Moyes, claiming there was a lack of clarity when it came to tactics and a lack of appreciation of what it meant to be part of United.\n\nHe recalls a training session Moyes held in a public part of Munich ahead of a Champions League game at Bayern.\n\nFerdinand said it was 'bizarre' to practise set-pieces in front of members of the public who began filming the session. 'It was amateurish,' writes Ferdinand. 'I mean, why not just send Bayern an email or a DVD.'\n\nFerdinand reveals how Moyes then told him he would not be playing against the Germans 'in front of everybody'.\n\n'It was probably the worst single moment I had at United,' he recalls. 'It killed me. Inside I wanted to scream and grab him.'\n\nWhen it came to delivering instructions for the match, Ferdinand claims Moyes only succeeded in confusing the players. He says Ferguson used to give 'simple, concise, clear instructions'. Moyes, however, said they could employ 'three formations' depending on 'how Bayern played'. 'We lost and 13 days later Moyes was sacked,' writes Ferdinand.\n\nThe former England captain agrees that Moyes was not dismissed 'in a dignified way' by United. But he says Moyes 'tried to impose a vision but never seemed to be completely clear what that vision should be'.\n\nHe says he 'unintentionally created a negative vibe' and 'slowly lost' the players because of an 'accumulation of mistakes'.", "Pressure has intensified after defeats against Real Soceidad and Atletico\n\nReal Madrid fans tried to kick Gareth Bale's car and shouted abuse at Toni Kroos and Raphael Varane as the players left training on Monday.\n\nThe atmosphere around the club is far from positive, given their back-to-back defeats against Real Sociedad and rivals Atletico Madrid.\n\nWhen the players left their Valdebebas training complex in their expensive sports cars, a group of fans were waiting for them.\n\nSome shouted for Bale to sign autographs, but he didn't stop and two of them tried to kick his car on the way past.\n\nOne clearly missed, while the second appears to make some minor contact.\n\nGerman midfielder Kroos, a summer signing from Bayern Munich, had some fans shout: \"W****! Foreign s***\" at him, while Varane was also abused.\n\nThe incident was captured by Spanish television station Cuatro's cameras.\n\nMadrid are preparing for their first Champions League match, against Basel at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday night.\n\nThe game against Atletico on Saturday was marked by fan dissent from the stands, with Iker Casillas and Karim Benzema in particular suffering from whistles.\n\nSupporters are also unhappy that Angel Di Maria and Xabi Alonso were sold this summer without adequate replacement.\n\nAncelotti defended his side's performances, saying: 'We have to get used to new players and try to play with more spontaneity.", "It is eight years since Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team reached the Champions League final for the first and only time in their history and they stand alone as the most consistent English qualifier for the competition, now that Manchester United have fallen by the wayside. But it just would not be Arsenal in Europe if there was not a mood of mild panic as they approach their first game in the competition desperately short of right-backs. Mathieu Debuchy, for one, is out injured.\n\nWenger approached the diminishing number of fit and available defenders among his ranks with the usual pre-match good humour that dissolves when he walks out of the tunnel on match day.\n\nHe may yet have to call upon Hector Bellerin, a 19-year-old with one substitute's appearance to his name, tomorrow night against Borussia Dortmund, but if that was of concern to the Arsenal manager then he certainly did not show it as he embarks upon his 17th consecutive Champions League campaign.\n\nIt is early days yet, although Arsenal's unfortunate habit of finishing second in their group in the last two years has contributed to them drawing Bayern Munich in the last 16 twice and going out of the competition each time. They have finished second in those groups to German teams on both occasions - Schalke in 2012, and Dortmund last season - so this year it is not hard to see where the improvement might come. It is also their last season under the old Uefa system that has guaranteed them a place among the seeds despite their recent run of third and fourth place Premier League finishes.\n\nNot since the 2009-10 season have Arsenal made it out of the last 16. They last reached the semi-finals in 2008-09, when they were beaten by Manchester United home and away. Despite his team's doggedness in qualifying, this has been a competition of diminishing returns for Wenger.\n\nTomorrow, however, it is a more expensively assembled Arsenal that the locals will come to the Westfalenstadion to see. Of the two clubs' respective World Cup-winning German players it is the Arsenal contingent who had the greater number of finals appearances between them this summer. Mesut \u00d6zil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski racked up 15 between them to the six that Mats Hummels, injured for tomorrow's game, played.\n\nThere will be more German World Cup experience in red shirts on the pitch than there will be in the native yellow. Asked whether that would bring with it the attendant pressure, Wenger agreed.\n\n\"In the Dortmund squad they had no [Ilkay] G\u00fcndogan and no [Marco] Reus, and they would have played in the World Cup finals if they had been fit,\" he said. \"It is always a pressure when you come back to your country. If I took Wojciech Szczesny to play in Poland, he would be under scrutiny. The attention [on them] is a bit bigger.\"\n\nHummels, Reus and G\u00fcndogan are three among an injury list of seven first-team players J\u00fcrgen Klopp will be without. The Dortmund manager's goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was a non-playing member of the World Cup squad, so too Kevin Grosskreutz and Erik Durm, who are both likely to be in the starting XI. The 20-year-old Matthias Ginter, another non-playing member of the World Cup party, is also in the Dortmund squad.\n\nAny meeting between Klopp and Wenger, and this is the third in four years, has a tendency to turn into one of mutual appreciation. Klopp was reminded by one of the German press that he had once said he \"loved\" Wenger, although the Dortmund coach said he had no recollection of ever having done so. \"He [Wenger] is very nice, very intelligent,\" he said. \"We met at the Uefa coaching congress. I respect him in the highest manner for taking the right decisions in hard times.\n\n\"It's easy for anyone to take decisions when it's fine, but he took decisions in tough days. I would never compare myself to other managers in the world, let alone someone like him.\"\n\nLike Wenger, Klopp has lost his best players over the years to one bigger domestic rival in particular and any number of big European clubs. Like Wenger, he has done a good job of replacing them and has decided to stay put himself, resisting the chance to move on to bigger clubs.\n\nKlopp has also brought one favourite player back, Shinji Kagawa from Manchester United who, in the absence of Reus, is expected to start in his preferred No 10 position behind the Colombian striker Adrian Ramos. To give Kagawa the benefit of the doubt you would say he was not put to his best use by United; even so, he seemed to develop a habit of letting his opportunity slip by.\n\nKagawa has already played his way back into the affection of the home support with a goal and what Klopp described as a \"sensational\" performance in the league win over Freiburg on Saturday.\n\n\"I was kind of surprised Shinji was on the market once again,\" Klopp said. \"His first year [at United] there was the last year of Sir Alex Ferguson and that's not the time when you develop a player. It is all about results and titles. His second year at United was the first year of a new coach and once again it's all about results. His third year was another new coach [Louis van Gaal], with a whole new and very successful philosophy, and maybe he didn't fit in with it. We saw the chance and took it.\"\n\nThere will be something to prove for Kagawa and so too for \u00d6zil, who is not as widely appreciated in Germany as you might expect for a man who started every one of his country's games at the World Cup, including every minute of the final. Klopp was alert to the sensitivity of the subject when asked about the Arsenal man. \"That's not an issue to me,\" he said, \"even if it's a Germany player, even if it's a player for the national team. I don't want to say anything about this.\"\n\nFor the Germans in Wenger's squad who played in the World Cup final, this will be a night when they will get some idea of their new status in their home country.\n\nFor Wenger, he could do with some of that success having an effect on an Arsenal record in this competition that has looked a little jaded in recent years.", "It was the European Cup final. The flashlights were skipping around the bowl of the Luzhniki Stadium as Chelsea and Manchester United walked out into the driving Moscow rain. At the back of them was Brendan Rodgers, then part of Avram Grant's coaching staff.\n\n\"I was picturing myself as the manager in a Champions League final and what it might be like,\" he recalled as he prepared to take charge of Liverpool for the first time in the competition. \"I was framing the mindset of that one day and telling myself that, if this were to happen, then I will have been here before.\n\n\"At that time in my mind I was preparing towards being the manager. All the experiences of the games in that period helped because, in my mind, I was looking at the game and making decisions as [if I were] a manager.\"\n\nSix years later and Rodgers finds himself as the manager of a club who have contested seven European Cup finals and he must back himself to take charge of an eighth. In his programme notes for Liverpool's first Champions League fixture in five seasons, he wrote: \"Our excitement to be playing Champions League football again isn't a 'giddy' excitement.\n\n\"We are not tourists in this competition - we believe it is where we belong. We are Liverpool, we are five-times winners of the European Cup and we are synonymous with its best traditions. Our players are excited by the challenges ahead not daunted by them.\"\n\nRodgers had just entertained two Liverpool fans in his office. He knew them because wherever the club have been, so have they. \"They were telling me: 'If you thought the Chelsea atmosphere was good in 2005, wait until we play Real Madrid at home'.\"\n\nIt might have been fitting if their first game back was against Madrid, one of the two clubs who have won more European Cups, but this will not be a grand return.\n\nLudogorets are based in Razgrad, a town in northern Bulgaria whose population could fit comfortably into Anfield. By the weekend, they had been reduced to their third-choice keeper and signed the 26-year-old Milan Borjan, who typifies the modern footballer. He was born in Croatia, has kept goal for Canada and played in leagues as disparate as Argentina and Finland. A free agent, he was on the point of joining Sarajevo when Ludogorets asked if he fancied a game at Anfield.\n\nThe opposition could be grander but Bob Paisley's journey to his first European Cup final, in 1977, began with a home tie against Crusaders of Belfast. It hit home to Rodgers when he looked at the Champions League footballs that had disappeared from Anfield's pitches with Rafa Benitez's dismissal.\n\nMuch has changed since then. When the draw was made for the 2009-10 competition, Liverpool were ranked by Uefa above Manchester United, Milan, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. This year they found themselves in pot three. Yesterday, in Anfield's Room, Rodgers spoke of Liverpool not just competing in the Champions League but of becoming a sustained presence.\n\n\"It hits home as soon as you actually see yourself back in the Champions League how much it can actually be missed,\" he said. \"I looked at the footballs yesterday. Little, simple touches like that let you know where this club has to be. It is very important that we really enjoy it, embrace everything about it and look to ensure we stay in it. It is difficult to get in and it will be even harder to stay in. I think that's the reality.\"\n\nNobody quite sums up the transformation of Liverpool better than Jordan Henderson. The midfielder was one of three English footballers taken to Anfield by Kenny Dalglish at a cost of around \u00a375m. All were lambasted as examples of the profligacy of the Premier League but, while Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing have gone, Henderson has flourished for both Liverpool and England.\n\nIn the wake of Daniel Agger's return to Denmark, Rodgers named the Wearsider as vice-captain and sees him as Steven Gerrard's natural successor. \"He is someone who represents a lot of what we are about,\" said his manager.\n\n\"He and Stevie are the moral compass of our group - how they conduct themselves on and off the field, how they train and how they work. The first summer I came here he had the opportunity to leave.\n\n\"I did not push him out or ask him to go but, like I do with all the players if another club come in for them, I present them with the opportunity they have. I said: 'Listen, you have a chance to go to Fulham where you can play every week - or you can stay here. I can't guarantee you a game straight away but I know one thing; I will improve you as a player'.\n\n\"That first period of him being out of the team really helped him tactically because we could work more on video and analyse his game. From that, he has really grown in confidence. I think he will be around for years to come.\"", "Manchester United may be missing out on the Champions League for the first time in 19 years but in dumping Danny Welbeck for Radamel Falcao, it appears that Louis van Gaal has recognised one of the tournament's dominant trends.\n\nAs the 2014-15 group stage gets under way on Tuesday night, Uefa's technical report into last season's competition has highlighted the shortage of top-level European strikers as a key talking point along with current tactical practices.\n\nJust as the Premier League has not produced an English top scorer since Kevin Phillips with Sunderland in 2000, so Real Madrid's Raul in 2001 was the last player to win the Champions League's golden boot playing for a club from their own country. The report said: \"In the attacking departments of the top clubs, native players generally had marginal roles and minimal presence.\"\n\nOf the combined 191 goals scored by the eight Champions League quarter-finalists last season, only eight of them came from forward players representing a home-country club - Germany's Thomas M\u00fcller got five for Bayern Munich, with United's Wayne Rooney (two) and Welbeck (one) scoring three between them for United.\n\nThe Uefa report also quoted the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who said: \"If you look at the top strikers, most of them are South American. In Europe we're not producing many real strikers.\"\n\nThe England Under-21 coach, Gareth Southgate, was among the technical observers who helped compile the report and can appreciate the attraction of South American imports. \"They are all gifted in those one v one duels but also physically strong,\" he told The Independent, pointing to the impact of Brazil-born Diego Costa at Chelsea who, like Colombia's Falcao, seems \"to be able do everything\".\n\nThat said, Southgate takes heart from the fact Wenger, while signing Chile's Alexis Sanchez this summer, has also bucked the trend by giving Welbeck the chance to lead Arsenal's attack - potentially with Theo Walcott alongside him. When you add the fact Daniel Sturridge - when fit - and Raheem Sterling will be spearheading Liverpool's Champions League challenge, there are encouraging possibilities for English forwards, even if Chelsea and City have no front-line English attacker between them.\n\n\"With [World Cup winners] Germany, everybody is focusing on the system, but you can't ignore the impact of the big-match experience with Bayern or with Borussia Dortmund that their players had,\" said Southgate. \"It is crucial for our [England] players to play Champions League football.\"\n\nThe Uefa technical report assessed the prevailing tactical trends and Southgate himself is quoted, noting how, in this post-tiki taka era, \"teams that dominate possession are being beaten by well-organised defensive blocks and quick counter-attacks\".\n\nAtletico Madrid averaged just 45 per cent possession over a season in which they reached the Champions League final. Winners Real Madrid struck 13 goals from counter-attacks, while Dortmund, Arsenal's opponents in Germany tonight, got seven of their 18 goals this way.\n\n\"With teams on the highest level now, the transition is particularly an area they work on,\" said Southgate. \"They don't get obsessed with having more possession.\"\n\nHe believes Liverpool have the attacking players to thrive in this environment. \"They did that against Arsenal and Everton at home [winning 5-1 and 4-0 last season] and you would imagine away from home they would be set up to do that even more so.\"\n\nAlso in vogue is the deep-lying creative midfielder and Liverpool, Southgate noted, have a \"classic example\" in Steven Gerrard. Where the old \"Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 role\" was a destructive one, the sitting midfielder is now charged with starting the attacks, according to Uefa's report.\n\n\"The trend is for playmakers to operate from deep positions and to open play to the flanks,\" it said. Wide men have more importance than ever, owing to the presence of two opposition holding midfielders blocking the central path; this was underlined by the fact the number of goals from the traditional through ball fell to 33 of the overall 362 scored last season.

They came back on the 11 August. That means I gave them one month of holiday.\n\n\"It was important for me that they would recover.

The main threats will be the German and Spanish teams. Look at the times Bayern has been in the final,\" said Wenger.\n\n\"There's no obvious reason why they should not be there again. Dortmund have been a regular participant and the two big clubs in Spain will be main contenders again.\"\n\nWenger also admitted he has great admiration for Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp who has made no secret of his desire to manage in England one day.\n\n\"I have great respect for Mr Klopp. He rose up very quickly in his career and inspired Dortmund,\" said Wenger.\n\n\"What does he do better than me?

Back in his native Ruhr Valley, a world champion, making his 50th appearance in the Champions League. The stage seems perfectly set.\n\nArsene Wenger accepts there will be intense scrutiny on his German trio, but the 80,000 fans who ignite Borussia Dortmund's Westfalen-stadion with their high-visibility traditional yellow colours and an incessant din are unlikely to provide a generous homecoming for the World Cup heroes.\n\nOzil is a product of fierce local rivals Schalke, 30 miles to the west, in Gelsenkirchen, although it is nearly seven years since he left for Werder Bremen and Real Madrid before Arsenal decided to invest a club record \u00a342.5million in his talents.\n\nDortmund boss Jurgen Klopp swerved the chance to extol his qualities or to massage his confidence on the eve of such a vital fixture. 'Even if he is a German player and a national, I don't want to say anything about this,' said Klopp. 'That's not an issue for me.'\n\nOzil is by some distance Arsenal's most expensive signing and his flickering performances have been exposed by the instant impact of Alexis Sanchez, who arrived from Barcelona this summer for a mere \u00a330m.\n\nAs Sanchez proved when he ripped off his shirt after scoring against Manchester City on Saturday, he is more muscular and robust and in this regard better equipped to resist the rigours of the English game.\n\nOzil's more slender frame and subtle skills often seem in danger of being obliterated by the chaotic blur of the Premier League. Wenger, however, insists his contributions are too easily overlooked and he remains confident the 25-year-old will be successful in north London.\n\nPerhaps it will be in Europe, in Champions League football where he starts to show his true value.

The Bundesliga runners-up are riddled with injuries which have ruled out important players such as Ilkay Gundogan, Marco Reus, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Mats Hummels.\n\nRobert Lewandowski moved on to Bayern in the summer but Shinji Kagawa has lifted spirits since his return from Manchester United, scoring on his debut against Freiburg on Saturday.\n\n'It was sensational,' said Klopp. 'I was kind of surprised he was on the market once again.

Photo: Reuters\n\nRio Ferdinand has revealed what he believes were a series of mistakes David Moyes made during his unsuccessful stint as manager of Manchester United - including the banning of chips the night before matches.\n\nFormer United defender Ferdinand - who made an unhappy return to Old Trafford when his QPR side were hammered 4-0 in the Premier League by his old club on Sunday has had his say on Moyes's woeful 10 months in charge of United in his autobiography '#2Sides', which is being serialised in the Sun.\n\nWe've got to get on to Giggsy. We've got to get him to get us our chips back.\n\nThe 35-year-old centre-back also labelled Moyes's tactics \"embarrassing\" and said the Scot had brought with him the \"mentality of a small club\" following his time in charge of Everton. But Ferdinand said one of the first signs of looming trouble was Moyes's ban on the tradition of players eating chips the evening before a game.\n\nGolden wonder boy: Ryan Giggs resurrected the club tradition of chips the night before a match after taking over from Moyes - much to the players' delight. Photo: AP\n\n\"It's not something to go to the barricades over [the chips] ... And guess what happened after Moyes left and Ryan Giggs took over? Moyes has been gone about 20 minutes, we're on the bikes warming up for the first training session and one of the lads says, 'You know what? We've got to get on to Giggsy. We've got to get him to get us our chips back.\"'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer England defender Ferdinand, who won 81 caps, said the players became confused by Moyes's tactics.\n\n\"Moyes's innovations mostly led to negativity and confusion. Sometimes our main tactic was the long, high, diagonal cross. It was embarrassing. In one home game against Fulham we had 81 crosses! I was thinking, why are we doing this? Andy Carroll doesn't play for us!\n\n\"The whole approach was alien. Other times Moyes wanted lots of passing. He'd say, 'Today I want us to have 600 passes in the game. Last week it was only 400'. Who cares? I'd rather score five goals from 10 passes.\"\n\nMoyes was the hand-picked successor of former United manager Alex Ferguson, who retired in 2013 after more than 26 years in charge at Old Trafford, during which time he had become British football's most successful manager.\n\nBut before the following season was finished, Moyes had been sacked with United finishing the campaign seventh in the Premier League - a position which meant they failed to qualify for both the lucrative Champions League and the second-tier Europa League.\n\nFerdinand said he knew it was time for him to leave United after 12 years at Old Trafford when Moyes dropped him for the Champions League tie with Bayern Munich while the club trained on a public park - something he labelled \"amateurish\".\n\nUnited lost 3-1 in Germany and, following a 2-0 defeat at Everton, Moyes was sacked on April 22.\n\nAFP", "Hamburg and coach Mirko Slomka, the duo that dodged relegation by a gnat's wing last season, have parted ways just three games into the new campaign. In those matches, HSV scored just one point and not a single goal.\n\nThe Bundesliga coaching \"sack race\" is about the only competition that Hamburger Sport-Verein look fit to win these days, and the club's board secured the dubious honor on Monday evening, putting Mirko Slomka on leave of absence. HSV's media director J\u00f6rn Wolf confirmed the news to multiple outlets.\n\nEarlier on Monday, after losing 2-0 to Hannover 96 in Sunday's evening match, Slomka had conducted a short training session with his players. His website made no mention of the development, still announcing Saturday's upcoming home game against Bayern Munich. German news agency DPA reported that chairman Dietmar Beiersdorfer broke the news personally to Slomka, also saying that a replacement might be unveiled as early as Tuesday.\n\nSlomka only took up the post in February, narrowly steering the never-relegated \"dinosaurs\" of the Bundesliga to survival via the relegation playoff. Three matches into the new Bundesliga season, despite some heavy off-season investment on the transfer market, HSV are back at the bottom of the pile. Hamburg have yet to score a goal this season, with just the one point on their account for an opening-day draw with newly-promoted Cologne.\n\nIn Hamburg's previous 51 Bundesliga seasons, a figure no other German club can claim, the \"dinos\" had always netted at least once in their first three games. Leon Andreasen and Artur Sobiech did the damage early in the first half for Hannover on Sunday, before Hamburg spurned several good chances to pull themselves back into contention at coach Slomka's old club.\n\nNew faces, old problems\n\nHaving narrowly dodged the drop, Hamburg spent heavily during the transfer window. The club made striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga a permanent fixture after his year on loan, brought midfielder Lewis Holtby back from his miserable stay in England, and secured US World Cup goal-scorer Julian Green on loan from Bayern Munich. Brazilian Cleber was recruited to bolster the defense, as was Matthias Ostrzolek, while Nicolai M\u00fcller moved north from Mainz. All these new weapons have taken to the pitch, none have yet hit the target.\n\nIt's not clear who will sit in the dugout for Hamburg's next league match, a home encounter with Bayern Munich. Whoever takes the Hamburg helm has a horrendous run of fixtures in store, also facing Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim during the next five weeks. In the German Cup, the northern Germans are just as short on good fortune, having drawn defending champions Bayern Munich in just the second round.\n\nHSV raced through three coaches last season, dropping Thorsten Fink on September 16, hiring Bert van Marwijk for less than six months, then taking on Slomka. Neither van Marwijk nor Slomka could manage a win-rate of one every five games; both presided over fewer than 20 league matches.\n\nSlomka was free to join Hamburg after his mid-season dismissal from Hannover 96, where the mathematics teacher spent three years, twice leading H96 into the Europa League.", "Many players at the Arab Bank Cup have left their countries due to war but soccer provides an opportunity to heal wounds\n\nThe Bankstown City Sports Complex is a large sprawling ground comprising football fields, baseball diamonds, netball courts and cricket pitches. Embracing all of western Sydney's sporting diversity, the world game takes precedence on Saturday morning for the second running of the Arab Bank Cup.\n\nI arrive early at the ground to meet the President of the Australian Lebanese Football Association (ALFA), Remy Wehbe, who informs me he's been here setting up since 5am. Remy is a former Lebanese military man, strongly built, with a clean shaven head, jug ears and wide friendly brown eyes. An attentive host, Remy clasps my hand and welcomes me to the club, fetches me coffee, and in between his errands, we talk football. Remy arrived in Australia in 2008 and is the CEO of the Wehbe Group, which amongst other things runs El Telegraph, the local Arabic newspaper. A well known figure within the community, it was Remy who established ALFA and the Arab Bank Cup. \"It's mainly the western Sydney area at the moment, and where Lebanese are involved in clubs,\" says Remy. \"But because of the Asian Cup 2015, we wanted them to play under their country's banner.\"\n\nFor the first time, there are four representative 'national' teams participating: Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine and Saudi Arabia. The players are a mix of recent arrivals, young men on student visas and second-generation immigrants. \"Sport has always been part of my life since I was a kid, as it is for my kids now,\" Remy says. \"Soccer is one our passions: we live it, we breathe it, it's a part of my life and my culture.\"\n\nThe tournament was supposed to run over two consecutive Saturdays, but wet weather forces all the games, from Under-12s to All Age, to be squeezed into the one day. The morning is foggy and cold, and as the senior teams warm up, it starts to drizzle ominously. On one field, Lebanon are lining up to play Saudi Arabia, but I wander over to the other field to see a match between Iraq and Palestine.\n\nThe Iraqi team are a professional looking outfit, kitted out in smart green jerseys with a black, white and red trim. The pan-Arab colours, however, are somewhat offset by the white Real Madrid stockings, complete with the Spanish crown. The Palestinian team are in borrowed kits from Bankstown Sports Club, and in truth, they look far less organised. Iraq play pretty football, knocking it around casually and working to create space for attacking opportunities. They score first, and then again before half-time. The centre-forward for Palestine, who spent much of the first half complaining, walks off the field angrily remonstrating with the referee, and as Iraq extend their lead in the second half, he clashes with an Iraqi player off the ball. It's one of those classic park football standoffs: first there's the exchange of views, then there's the customary chin-to-chin squaring off, then some shoving, and then everyone else gets involved to dilute the situation. \"Zip it\" screams the centre forward to his opponent as they are separated. \"No one is talking to you\" responds an Iraqi. \"Watch the swearing and just play soccer!\" yells a bloke from the sideline. Within minutes calm is restored as the players clear the air, and the focus turns back to football. Iraq end up winning 5-0.\n\nThese might be friendly matches, but there is still a healthy competitive edge. \"I didn't want to send them off, you know, because it's a friendly game,\" explains the referee Wissam Abbas. Wissam helped to organise the Palestinian representative team for today. \"They are a mix,\" he says. \"The guys are from Jordan, from the West Bank, I think one or two from the Gaza Strip. You know, with the situation, we are spread everywhere. They actually had four Iraqi players, but because the other team were Iraq national team we decided it was not fair to get them to play against their country.\"\n\nWissam is a handsome man, with deep brown skin, grey stubble and dark eyes. A black Football Federation Australia referees cap covers his bald head and he walks with a slight stoop, but he is broad shouldered and strong. A deep scar runs along the back of his neck where he had a cancer removed, and he is currently receiving chemotherapy for a lymphoma near his throat. He came to Australia in 2004 on a business visa to work as a mechanical engineer, and now has permanent residency with his wife and three children.\n\n\"I was born in Lebanon, in a Palestinian refugee camp,\" he tells me. \"My parents were born in Lebanon and my grandparents migrated from Palestine in 1948, when they declared the Israeli state.\" Like many Palestinian families, Wissam's family remember their village fondly. \"Now with the technology and the internet we can actually find pictures of our village in what they call Israel now,\" he says.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), there are nearly half a million Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon. Displaced by war, the Palestinians are further marginalised by restrictions on employment and social services in Lebanon. \"It's a hard situation,\" says Wissam. \"Some were born in Lebanon but they are still treated as refugees. So, we don't have our country, we don't have our own state, we can't go back to West Bank or Gaza. That's what makes it hard, you know, we are like in the middle of nowhere. We're not Lebanese, but we can't be Palestinian.\"\n\nHaving lived in Australia for almost a decade, and with relatives elsewhere in the world, Wissam believes Australia is \"the best country to live in\". He raises his children as Australians, but when they are old enough, he will teach them more about their background. \"If we didn't do this since 1948, if our parents didn't teach us, our identity would be dissolved,\" he says.\n\nWissam explains that through the Bankstown Sports Club and ALFA he is able to mix with Lebanese Christians, Shi'a Muslims, Croatians, Macedonians, Italians and people from all walks of life. But while football acts as a social adhesive, it is also a tool of resistance.\n\nIn January, the Palestinian national team will arrive in Australia to play in the Asian Cup. \"We were the last team to qualify,\" says Wissam, smiling broadly. \"People think we fight with weapons and stones but we can fight with everything. We can fight with soccer, with art, with everything. You can raise your flag here. For me, that's a win. To come to Australia and raise a Palestinian flag. My wife is already starting to put the flag on the hats for the kids.\n\n\"As an Australian to see our government is not declaring Palestine as a state is hard for me. But we try to change it in other ways, and soccer is an example. In the World Cup there was a Palestinian singer, Mohammad Assef, a very young guy who won Arab Idol. For me, that's another way, for him to go and sing. To play in a tournament like this, people realise we're Palestinian and we're no different to any other community.\"\n\nDuring the lunch break between games, the Saudi team keep mostly to themselves, laughing and messing about near the baseball batting cage in the far corner of the field. Many of them are here on scholarships from the government of Saudi Arabia, explains player-manager Abdullah Aldhafeeri. The Lebanese coach brings around a big box of warm Lebanese breads to share, while his players sit with wives and children and smoke shisha. The Iraqi coaches set up two tables and sell plastic-wrapped soccer shirts, and the kids swarm around like moths to a flame, eagerly grabbing at the Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona and other European club jerseys. \"They're an enterprising lot, these blokes,\" observes Dick Phillips, who is seated next to me. Dick has seen Bankstown Sports Club change as new immigrants have arrived during his three decades on the organisation's committee. \"This area is very diverse,\" says Dick. \"Most of these coaches here now are Lebanese, there's some Aussies ... When I say Aussies, they're all Aussies\" he adds with a laugh.\n\nThe showpiece is the final between the favourites, Lebanon, and the exciting young Iraqi team. Fadi Ghossan, a former Lebanese international who now lives with his family and works as a carpenter in Lakemba, scored two goals in Lebanon's win over Saudi Arabia in the earlier game. He now plays in the Over-35s for Banksia Tigers, but Fadi was once a striker for Al-Ansar, who are in the Guinness Book of Records for winning the Lebanese league 11 seasons in a row. \"Look, Lebanon is an amateur league to be honest,\" Fadi concedes. \"There's no future there. When you finish soccer you have nothing to do, you just sit at home.\" After marrying his fiancee in 2004, they decided to move to Australia. \"Soccer is our lifeblood. Work, come home, you know how it is here. We play soccer to have fun and to bring our families with us and meet together.\"\n\nIn a group of people who have left their homelands due to war, dispossession or economic reasons, this is a constant theme. As the Iraqi team warm up, the team manager Ghat Muhana tells me that football is \"the only happiness we have for our country\". He describes the joy of watching the Iraq national team win the Asian Cup in 2007. \"It was the worst situation in Iraq, but after winning the Asian Cup with all these players from different religions and cultures, it brought us together. The politicians couldn't do it, the players could.\"\n\nThe Iraqis, however, cannot replicate their earlier success against the Palestinians in the final. They dominate the possession, but the Lebanese are patient and cunning. After taking an early lead, Lebanon never look back, winning the game 6-2. Fadi scores two and sets up a couple more, and he is awarded the Golden Boot. While there is a clear pan-Arab spirit to the tournament, the final, much like the earlier games, is very competitive. The Iraq coach blows up at the linesman on more than one occasion, and there are niggly fouls and barbs exchanged throughout the match. \"That's just part of the game,\" laughs a Lebanese reserve, Ali Mahdi. He is chatting to the Iraqi onlookers, in particular Saadi Toma, a former captain and coach of the Iraqi national team who defected to Australia in 2007 with Sydney FC striker Ali Abbas. 'Captain Saadi' is a legend around here. \"He coached me for years in Lebanon\" says Ali, grabbing hold of Saadi's hand. \"He was a tough coach, but he looked after me and the players off the field as well.\" They grin at one another, marvelling at how football has brought them together again in their new country. \"Sport is the only thing that can bring human beings together,\" says Ali.\n\nThe formalities are delivered at the presentation as the consul-general of Lebanon, members of parliament, local councillors and a representative of the Asian Cup are welcomed and sponsors are thanked. \"We are genuine about engaging with these communities because we want them to feel part of the Asian Cup and we want to work with them to bring a unique atmosphere to the event,\" says the CEO of the Asian Cup Local Organising Committee, Michael Brown. \"Supporting events such as the Arab Bank Cup is part of that engagement, but it's also about supporting the growth of football more broadly and ensuring people who love the game have a door into the sport.\" Indeed Remy is one of 150 Asian Cup ambassadors appointed by the Local Organising Committee last year, while a staff member from the Western Sydney Wanderers is here to run a clinic for the kids.\n\nNearly 12 hours after he arrived at the ground, Remy is still shaking hands with his guests, joking with his friends and making sure everyone feels at home. He's happy that his son, Carl, scored two goals for Bankstown Sports Stars in a 2-1 win over Birrong Sports FC in the under-13s grand final. \"For us we believe that soccer is not about 22 players and two goals,\" Remy says during the presentation. \"It's about getting people together from different ethnic and religious backgrounds.\" This is a message that he has reinforced throughout the day. Of course, Israel have been excluded from the Asian Football Confederation since the 1970s, but next year Remy hopes to have a team representing Israel at the Arab Bank Cup. \"There is still some work to do,\" he says, \"but we believe that if you cannot get together over soccer, they will never get together.\"", "The Frenchman J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne has confirmed he will run for the Fifa presidency.

The damage is not deemed to be serious but with Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my and the prolific Diego Costa fit and available, Drogba is unlikely to be risked.

It was always how to stop the other side. Moyes set us up not to lose. We'd been accustomed to playing to win. Often Moyes told us to play it long.

Logan has alleged that a second-half incident took place. A Celtic spokesperson has said that Tonev \"has stated that the accusation made is not true\". PA", "They start on Wednesday night against Bayern Munich, the third time in four years they have been drawn against the German club, and enough this weekend to tip Manuel Pellegrini into that familiar discourse about the unfairness of the Uefa seeding system that has left City in the second tier and Arsenal still in the first pot.\n\nHe is right, of course, and even Uefa has come to see it his way. If City defend their Premier League title this season, next year they will find themselves rubbing shoulders with national champions in their pot, rather than in the group stage. They have come through one swingeing Financial Fair Play punishment, the kind of hurdle that Chelsea never had to clear when they spent fortunes to catch up with the traditional giants of Europe in the early Roman Abramovich days.\n\nIn 2011-12, City went out in the group stages with 10 points. Last season they took 15 points from 18 in the group, finished second in the head-to-head with Bayern, drew Barcelona and went out in the round of 16. City are a rich club, but nobody has made it easy for them. There comes a time, however, when for their own good they cannot allow themselves mitigating factors.\n\nFor much of the last six years since the Abu Dhabi takeover the story has been about how far City have come. Now more than ever it feels like time they faced in the other direction.\n\nTen years ago, as Bayern embarked on a double-winning season, City were staggering through the last few months of the Kevin Keegan era. Training sessions would often end with Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler lifting a drain lid near the clubhouse at Carrington and striking footballs at it the way a weekend golfer might fire a basket of balls at a solitary pin. Somewhere in the distance it would be possible to discern Keegan involved in an intensely competitive game of head tennis.\n\nEven those of us who are relatively new to this job can recall Joe Royle attending press conferences at the old Maine Road sipping a can of Strongbow. Now when you join the queue outside the Etihad Stadium's media entrance on a Champions League night, the front reception is lit up like the entrance for a film premiere and cars with blacked-out windows and VIP passes drop their guests just outside the crash barriers. Of course, none of the past will mean much to the likes of Sergio Aguero or Samir Nasri - what they know is that they have been part of the transformation of a club who were not on their radar pre-2008.\n\nThe past will always be there for City but with every season that goes by it feels less relevant. Champions of England again, the question is less about when they can win the Champions League and more how quickly it can be done.\n\nSuccess in this competition owes much to the confidence it can be done as the fractional differences in the relative merits of the talent-laden squads at the elite level of the game. The margins are finer than ever: no side has won the Champions League two years in a row, much less set up the kind of dynasties that existed in previous decades. The competition is the preserve of a tiny number of clubs, but, between them, wide open.\n\nOver the last 20 years it has been the case that the likes of Manchester United, Barcelona, Chelsea, Internazionale and the current Real Madrid side have made incremental progress towards winning the trophy before getting over the line. Only Arsenal, the beaten finalists eight years ago, fell away without quite reaching the peak.\n\nWhen the competition was the European Cup and for the champions only, it was less of a slog against the biggest names and more of an exercise in managing the unfamiliarity and occasional injustices of playing all over a less homogenised European football landscape. Brian Clough's experience with Derby County against Juventus in 1973, for instance, was one such hard lesson along the road.\n\nThose problems have been washed out of the game by the uniformity of Uefa's modern tournament with its harmonised refereeing standards and the transparency that blanket television coverage offers. Not all of it is better, certainly not the repetition of some group match-ups, but it offers the chance for progress to be made year on year.\n\nCurrently on the Mancunian Way there is just one billboard advertising European football on television, and it is all City. Not since the 1978-79 season, when City reached the quarter-finals of the Uefa Cup and were eliminated by Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, have they been in Europe and United not. It was another 25 years until City were to return in the same competition, as reluctantly as any Uefa fair play award recipient. They were eliminated on away goals by Groclin Dyskobolia from Poland in the second round.\n\nAlas, the intervening years have not been kind to Groclin who, in their current guise, are in their country's seventh tier. City, on the other hand, are reaching the point when European nights like that goalless draw at home to the Polish side will just seem like a bad dream. Soon there will be a whole generation wondering whether you are talking about the same club. They will expect City to win Champions League titles, and with some justification.\n\nAny new owners would have Tottenham in their debt\n\nFor all the problems that are associated with a long, troublesome quest to build a new stadium, Tottenham Hotspur have kept their debt low, one of the greatest - potentially the greatest - achievements of the Enic years under Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy. The financing for a new stadium would change that but the hope would be that, like the Emirates, it would eventually pay for itself.\n\nAs for Cain Hoy, the putative takeover party, one can only assume that any buyout of Spurs by them would involve borrowing money against the value of the club. Their chairman, Henry Silverman, is one of the 1980s founding fathers of private equity. The returns that the Glazers have made from their highly leveraged purchase of Manchester United has no doubt caught the attention of other would-be American sports investors and Spurs could make an attractive option for another leveraged buyout.\n\nEarly days yet, but private equity typically looks to sell on for a profit after about five years. Which would not give them long to resolve the issues at the heart of Spurs.", "The Blues will wear a nineties-inspired purple kit with green trim when they play away from home in cup competitions this season.\n\nManchester City have announced the launch of a new third kit for the 2014-15 season.\n\nThe Blues will wear the purple Nike strip when they play away from the Etihad Stadium in cup competitions throughout the current campaign.\n\nThe new kit is \"inspired by designs City wore in the early Nineties and as recently as the 2007-08 season\", a press release reveals.\n\nManuel Pellegrini's team are likely to sport their new look when they face Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena in the Champions League on Wednesday.\n\nCheck out a selection of City kits from down the years below...", "* 'I think we have a team good enough to win'\n\n* City lost 3-1 Bayern Munich in corresponding match last year\n\nJames Milner is clear that Manchester City have to prove themselves in the Champions League, with the midfielder stating winning the competition is the target.\n\nManuel Pellegrini's team face Bayern Munich in Bavaria in Wednesday's opening Group E fixture having reached the knockout phase last season for the first time.\n\nAsked how the European Cup is viewed at City, Milner said: \"It means a lot. When I first started at the club it was new to us as a club, new to us as a team. Players had played in it before, but it's completely different when you're playing in it as a group. So I think year on year we should get better and we'll keep on improving, the more experience we have as a group in the Champions League.\n\n\"There are a lot of games we've played now, a lot that we have learned over the years we've been in it and I think having won the Premier League a couple of times and been fortunate enough to win every trophy domestically, we want to prove ourselves on the European stage and I believe we have a good enough team to do that.\n\n\"I think being the club that we are, and with the players we have, winning it is the ultimate aim. But you never get too far ahead - you look at it a game at a time and start then.\"\n\nCity lost 3-1 to Bayern in the corresponding game of last year's group stage before Milner scored the winner in the 3-2 victory in the return. Of that match at the Allianz Arena last December, Milner said: \"We started the game terribly. I think the first 15 minutes we were 2-0 down and, playing against the European champions, I don't think there's many teams who would have come back from that - it would have been game done - but that shows the character and the quality we have in the squad, and to have that mental strength to come back and win the game is massive.\n\nMilner added: \"I was just hanging out at the back post. I think it might have been Jes\u00fas [Navas] who got down the right, put a cross in and it found its way through to me and I just managed to curl it in the far corner I think, which is something we do a lot in training.

Getty Images\n\nAs the UEFA Champions League kicks off on Tuesday and the cream of European club soccer starts its 10-month slog, the continent's elite is beginning to realize that something is missing: the classic European No. 9.\n\nThose physical target men from countries such as Italy, Germany and England whose sole purpose in life seems to be scoring goals -- pretty play and clean jerseys be damned -- are a dying breed at the highest level in Europe.\n\nInstead, they have become South America's most significant soccer export.\n\nThat's not to say that Europe isn't producing some stunning attacking players these days. Bayern Munich's winger Thomas M\u00fcller creates danger wherever he crops up on the field. But, according to Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the continent isn't churning out \"guys who get in the box and will score that 90th-minute diving header, even if it means putting their heads into the post. It doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\nOf the 15 clubs that finished in the top five in England, Spain and Italy last season, eight played with a South American striker up front in a traditional No. 9 role.\n\nThat included the likes of Manchester City with Argentina's Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid with Brazilian-born Diego Costa, Uruguay's Luis Su\u00e1rez, then of Liverpool, and Juventus JUVE.MI +0.47% Juventus Football Club S.p.A.

The only exception was Mario Balotelli, then of AC Milan, whose style often pulls him back into midfield and stretches the boundaries of what can be considered a No. 9.\n\nWenger pointed to Germany as a case in point. Twenty years ago, he said, every team in the Bundesliga seemed to play with almost interchangeable, pure goal scorers. Today, Germany has a generation of technically brilliant, offensive-minded players who sit just off the front (M\u00fcller, Mario G\u00f6tze, Mesut \u00d6zil, Toni Kroos, and the list goes on), but so few true strikers that die Nationalmannschaft went to Brazil with just one full-time No. 9, Miroslav Klose. And he was 35.\n\nOne reason, Wenger said, is that over the past 20 years, the European soccer education has centered on breeding ball-passing wizards. Technique, speed, and vision on the pitch are the top priorities.\n\nHow to use your elbows discreetly in a crowded penalty area doesn't make the list.\n\nAs former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso, now of Bayern Munich, put it in an interview with the Journal last spring, \"The prototype of the Spanish player is a player that likes to keep the ball, that understands the game. He likes to have good associations with the players around. He's not selfish.\"\n\nHe might as well have been laying out the ideal to which youth systems around Europe aspire. Barcelona's academy, La Masia, grew into soccer's Oxford, Harvard and a Swiss boarding school all rolled into one. The problem is that none of those qualities describes the most dangerous pure strikers in the world: the selfish, win-at-all-costs poacher who goes headfirst \"in the zones where it hurts,\" as Wenger put it.\n\n\"The striker's football is the football of the streets,\" he added. \"He's the guy who tries to push you, who plays on the edge of the rules. Su\u00e1rez is an example of a player who wasn't given a classical football education.\"\n\nWenger could have cited the similarly combative Costa -- Brazilian-born, imported by Spain to fill the vacuum up front. La Roja was so starved of talent at the striker position, even as it dominated world soccer, that its choices usually boiled down to the misfiring Fernando Torres or reinventing the role so thoroughly that Cesc F\u00e0bregas would play as a so-called \"false nine.\"\n\nCosta's World Cup adventure for his adoptive team turned out to be a miserable experience for player and national team. But his form in the Premier League so far -- seven goals in four appearances for Chelsea suggests that it will pay off in the long run.\n\nAnother reason Europe hasn't produced its own Costas of late is tactical. Teams like Spain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona set the tone for European soccer with systems built around speedy wingers and intricate passing through the middle. Attacking threats are coming from more areas.\n\nAnd that means the center forward in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3 system became a cog in the attacking machine rather than its focal point. At Arsenal, for instance, striker Olivier Giroud scored just 23.5% of the club's Premier League goals last season, compared with Thierry Henry's 41.1% share a decade earlier. (They are different caliber players, for sure, but the team was built to reflect that.)\n\nSo strikers are now what Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta called \"forwards in a more general sense...It means they do much more than shoot.\"\n\nOf course, European clubs still know how to identify that talent and nurture it. Spain and Portugal, in particular, have historically been finishing schools for strikers from all over South America.

Yes, it's only four games into the season but ... Jose Mourinho looks to have assembled an unstoppable force at Stamford Bridge ready to waylay all comers in its wake, despite falling behind to Swansea in an eventual 4-2 victory. The scariest aspect, following his hat trick vs. Swansea City, new striker Diego Costa is up to seven goals, having avoided a crippling case of Ke\u017eman-Shevchenko disease on the flight over from Atletico Madrid.\n\nChelsea flirted with the title last season with the Sameul Eto'o/Fernando Torres/Demba Ba troika combining for 19 league goals, now with Costa supported by Lo\u00efc Remy it's hard to come up with a scenario where the Blues fall short, bar a total team meltdown for a month. After four matches the Blues have already established a five-point gap between themselves and Manchester City, scoring a league-high 15 goals in the process.\n\nIs this going overboard after four matches? Perhaps, but what is so imposing about Chelsea is the team's depth. There isn't a spot on the field -- save for center back -- where the club doesn't have a highly-capable replacement. It doesn't hurt, either, that since coming over from Spain Cesc Fabregas is looking like a guy used to playing FIFA on legendary setting, only to get dropped in to a few on \"Professional\" difficultly now that he's back in England.\n\nTrue, Chelsea's already allowed six goals which is high for a Mourinho-managed team. However, if the Blues jump out to a big gap atop the table, he's got enough defensive players to park the bus and play for, dour, soul-sucking one-goal games when Chelsea plays the other title-contenders.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm on a major Simpsons kick lately, but right now Chelsea feels like the softball team comprised of ringers assembled by Mr. Burns in \"Homer at the Bat.\" There's going to need to be a lot of trips by Chelsea players to the Springfield Mystery Spot or cases of nerve tonic delivered to Stamford Bridge to slow down Chelsea's presumptive run to the title in May.\n\n***\n\nIs Mesut \u00d6zil \"good\"?\n\nNarrative alert: If you woke up to watch Arsenal's 2-2 draw early Saturday morning with Manchester City, the analyst on the world audio feed, Danny Mills, spent a lot of time harping on Gunners midfielder Mesut \u00d6zil, the club's record-signing from last August. This, coupled with \u00d6zil's mostly nondescript World Cup with Germany in the summer is enough for people to start wondering what all the fuss is about, apparently.\n\n3 - After assisting six goals in his opening 10 Premier League games for Arsenal, Mesut Ozil has created only three in his last 19. Fade.\n\n-- OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 14, 2014\n\nThis is what the stats say about \u00d6zil. In the 2013-14 season, after signing from Real Madrid on the final day of the transfer window, he played in 25 games scoring five goals with nine assists, completing 88 percent of his passes. This year he's played in three games without a goal or an assist. Is this enough from a player whom it seemed like a no-brainer for the Gunners to sign when he fell into their laps late in the 2013 summer window? \u00d6zil's reputation coming to Arsenal was of being a great passer, piling up assist totals of 17, 17 and 13 in his previous three seasons during league play with Real Madrid.\n\n\u00d6zil's assist totals at Madrid are inflated thanks to playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and for a team that generally dominants most other teams in the league. And stats hardly tell the whole story. If \u00d6zil is good enough to start at Real Madrid and for Germany during its World Cup triumph, he obviously is a pretty good player.\n\nAt the same time it's difficult to think of a indelible moment in his career since the move to Arsenal, or a stretch where he dominated games. That said, the perception on \u00d6zil is generally defined by small margins. If he plays a killer, weighted through ball to set up a goal, we think he's great, but if instead he merely plays a lot of short passes in the middle of the field to maintain possession we think he underwhelms. \u00d6zil is also hurt by the longstanding English soccer belief that unless a player runs his lungs out for 90 minutes, zooming around the field he's not giving it his all.\n\nHas \u00d6zil performed like a $70 million player for Arsenal? Not exactly, but I'd still think Arsene Wenger would want the German's name on the team sheet when he's making a lineup, this week in particular when the Champions League resumes. We'll have to see if this is a case of fans expecting and or wanting more from a player, or an actual decline in form by the German midfielder.\n\nEngine, Engine No. ... 7?\n\nFor the second straight year a big-time, left-footed Real Madrid player moved to the EPL late in the transfer window for the GDP of a small country. A year ago it was \u00d6zil. This summer it was Angel Di Maria. Like the German, the Argentine midfielder came in with a great reputation and lots of assists (17 in La Liga 2013-14) helping set up Ronaldo.\n\nGiven Di Maria's Manchester United career stands at only two games, it's unfair to compare \u00d6zil right away. On his own, it's still impressive to witness Di Maria stepping up from a complementary player at Real Madrid to arguably the team's most important tactical piece during its run to its 10th Champions League triumph in May. Manchester United fans, like Argentina fans (up until the World Cup final) can thank Carlo Ancelotti for converting Di Maria into a dynamic, two-way midfield force. Back in July I compiled a Top 10 soccer players list during the World Cup, looking back on it leaving Di Maria off is a terrible oversight, although when you spend so much of your time in the same lineup as Ronaldo and Lionel Messi it's easy to get overlooked.\n\nSunday, against a hapless QPR side, Di Maria quickly asserted himself as United's most-important player along with scoring his first goal for the club in a 4-0 rout. (Hey, look no more three-man defense!) If it hurts Wayne Rooney's fragile ego, so be it, but the United team should go through Di Maria until further notice. United completed over 90 percent of its passes vs. QPR, which looked like it didn't belong on the field at Old Trafford. It's premature to label the new-look United \"back,\" but that doesn't diminish the potential impact Di Maria can make, driving the team from the center of the field. Still, a midfield based around Di Maria, Ander Herrera and Daley Blind if a good start for United, saying nothing of whatever strikers Louis van Gaal settles upon.\n\nRemember, guys who wear No. 7 at Old Trafford have a pretty, pret-tay good history of making good.\n\nStat of Week:\n\n19 - Everton are the second top scorers in the PL this season (9 goals) and have the leakiest defence (10 goals).

It's the first one, and we have to win it since it's our first home match of the group.\"\n\nRoma complete an imposing Group E line-up for CSKA, who must once again tackle Bayern Munich and Manchester City outfits that beat them home and away last season.\n\nCoach Leonid Slutsky must do without Pontus Wernbloom and Alan Dzagoev as the duo begin three-game bans, while fellow midfielder Rasmus Elm (stomach) and defender Georgi Schennikov (ankle) are yet to feature this term and remain sidelined.\n\nRoman Eremenko has enjoyed a rich vein of goalscoring form since joining from Rubin Kazan, finding the target on both CSKA appearances to date either side of netting for Finland in his country's 3-1 win over Faroe Islands this month.\n\nSeydou Doumbia also scored on international duty, the Ivory Coast striker's first goal since a month on the sidelines with a hip injury.\n\nDoumbia's return provides a timely boost for Slutsky - the 26-year-old struck in the opening two matches of this term having scored 20 times in all competitions last season, including a Champions League brace at Manchester City.\n\nVitinho endured a less profitable time while away with his national side, the Brazil Under-23 attacking midfielder sustaining an ankle injury against Oman that will keep him sidelined until November.", "MADRID -- A coach's job is seldom safe at Real Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti delivered La Decima in his first season at the Santiago Bernabeu, but Madrid came within a minute of losing that final and had it done so, the Italian would have been unlikely to remain at the club.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, the side's disappointing displays brought plenty of criticism from the Madrid media. Ancelotti spoke of finding \"balance\" in midfield and he eventually did - with Xabi Alonso and Angel Di Maria.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti (Getty Images)\n\nMORE: Messi takes flight FIFA '15 trailer | Soccer WAGs | Beautiful fans\n\nBut with those two now long gone following summer moves to Bayern Munich and Manchester United, respectively, Ancelotti must find the balance all over again. And with three defeats in the team's last four fixtures, he had better find it quickly.\n\n\"Real Madrid are a team of athletes, we're a diesel team,\" the Italian said last week in reference to his side's slow start to 2014-15. But he added: \"I'll find the right solution again.\"\n\nMadrid kick off its Champions League campaign on Tuesday at home to Swiss side Basel and hopes to become the first team to retain the trophy since the competition's format changed in 1992. Inexplicably, however, Real is weaker now than when it won the trophy on that special night in Lisbon back in May.\n\nSummer signings Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez lifted the mood after the World Cup. \"With Kroos and James we are even stronger,\" Luka Modric said in July. And they were. But then Di Maria and Alonso left the club.\n\n\"Alonso was vital for Madrid,\" former Real winger Jose Amavisca told Goal. \"It was when he returned from injury last season that the team started to play well. He was the one who pulled the strings in midfield and dictated the play, but he also gave the team a balance they had been lacking in his absence.\"\n\nAnd that balance was missing as Alonso sat out the Champions League final due to suspension. Without him, Madrid so nearly lost. Sergio Ramos' late leveler forced extra-time, but Di Maria was the Man of the Match and the Argentine's remarkable run set up Gareth Bale for the crucial second goal.\n\n\"Di Maria was such an important player last season and there are very few like him. Madrid will struggle to replace what he gave to the team,\" former Spain midfielder Gaizka Mendieta told Goal.\n\nAncelotti utilized Di Maria in a midfield role which saw the Argentine track back to help out in defense and set up goals at the other end with his pace, boundless energy and indefatigable spirit. Few such players exist in world football.\n\nMadrid may be lucky enough to have two of them in Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, but the Portuguese is never going to be deployed in such a role (nor should he be), while the Welshman will probably not be keen on regressing back to a midfield slot.\n\nNevertheless, Ancelotti is considering a midfield three with Bale in the 'Di Maria role' alongside Kroos and Modric. \"Bale is an option for Ancelotti in midfield and he played there for Tottenham,\" former Liverpool striker and Spanish football pundit Michael Robinson said on his video blog this week. \"But we have seen that he isn't a player who links up that much with his teammates. Maybe that was because he was the new kid, however, and perhaps Ancelotti now thinks that process is behind him - and that playing him further back would allow James more license to roam and connect with Cristiano and Benzema.\"\n\nIf Bale is indeed willing to play that role, the Welshman has the tools necessary to be able to shine as Di Maria did. As a former fullback, he knows all about covering and tracking back, while his runs from deep positions at Tottenham often proved devastating as he both scored and assisted with wonderful pace and dribbling. However, this role requires much more defensive discipline than his current position and as the world's most expensive player, it remains to be seen whether he would be willing to operate in a more \"sacrificial\" role on the left, behind Ronaldo.\n\nPotentially, that could solve one problem. But Alonso's departure has created another because Kroos - for all his obvious talents - is simply not a holding midfielder. Neither, of course, is Modric. Both are excellent ball-players and hard workers, but the pair are vulnerable together in a double pivot and Bale dropping back wouldn't solve that problem either.\n\nThe arrival of James means that, to some extent, Ancelotti's hands are tied. He has to play the Colombian because he was the club's marquee signing and cost around 80 million euros, but he must also find room for Kroos - and the rest of the team virtually picks itself.\n\n\"Kroos has to adapt,\" former Madrid midfielder Alvaro Benito wrote in his column in AS on Sunday. \"The German has almost always had a shield behind him to do the dirty work, but he will have to adapt and take on much more responsibility defensively because if not, the team will always suffer against demanding rivals.\"\n\nThat, however, is a solution which will take time and doubts remain over the German's ability to change his game and become the player Madrid needs in that position.\n\nThe alternative is to bring in another player. Sami Khedira is currently injured, but his inclusion would give the midfield more balance. The German is more limited in terms of technical ability, however. Another option would be to include Asier Illarramendi, the man who was signed as Alonso's long-term replacement in the first place. Ancelotti, however, doesn't appear convinced by the 24-year-old.\n\nCasemiro is possibly the answer in the future, but the Brazilian was sent out to Porto on loan for the season, leaving Ancelotti with one last and very intriguing alternative: Raphael Varane.\n\nThe Italian thought about playing the Frenchman in midfield against Atleti and he could be the solution to the team's problems. Already an excellent defender, the 21-year-old would be comfortable dropping deep to help out Sergio Ramos and Pepe, while his presence would surely avoid situations like the one from which Atleti scored the winner on Saturday - when Raul Garcia and Arda Turan were left all alone in the area at a throw-in. Varane also boasts excellent technical ability and plenty of pace - another attribute Kroos is lacking.\n\nVarane has often been likened to Fernando Hierro, now Madrid's assistant coach. Hierro himself was a fine center back who played much of his career in midfield and he would be able to pass on invaluable advice.\n\n\"We have a great squad. Maybe we no longer have a great team,\" said Hierro's former teammate Manolo Sanchis at the weekend.\n\nIt pretty much summed up the current situation and just like last season, it's up to Ancelotti to change all that once again. Madrid's hopes of retaining the Champions League depend on it.", "Seedings, FFP and the like continue to rankle with the Blues boss, but the Allianz Arena is the perfect place to prove the club CAN win the Champions League\n\nManuel Pellegrini appeared a troubled old soul at the \u00adEmirates on Saturday.\n\nThis Charming Man. The Chillin' Chilean. The Engineer. The 'holistic' peacemaker who healed the internal divisions of the Roberto Mancini years.\n\nYet there he was sounding like any other manager, ranting at Mark Clattenburg over a series of borderline decisions . Still seemingly eaten up by the same referee failing to award Manchester City a blatant penalty at Liverpool last season - despite that defeat ending up \u00adirrelevant in the title race.\n\nAnd now City head to Bayern Munich in the Champions League with Pellegrini still serving a \u00adtouchline ban for a strange attempt to blame last season's home defeat by \u00adBarcelona on the Swedishness of the referee .\n\nThis sort of paranoia suggests Pellegrini feels at home with the Blue Moonies.\n\nIn pictures - Arsenal vs Manchester City:\n\nCity's wonderful fans have always loved a conspiracy theory, their sardonic gloominess fostered during decades in the shadows of Stretford's 'evil empire'.\n\nBut as Joseph Heller wrote in Catch 22, 'Just because you're \u00adparanoid doesn't mean they aren't after you'.\n\nBecause, despite the sovereign wealth of an oil-drenched nation funding a squad of superstars to win two Premier League titles in three years , City remain outsiders in Europe. They are still the sneered-upon nouveau riche in the cosy Champions League gentleman's club.\n\nPellegrini rightly argues that City suffer under a ludicrous system which sees the Premier League champions not among the \u00adcompetition's top seeds, while Arsenal receive star billing simply for always being there.\n\nHe can also point to the lop-sided nature of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, which sees Manchester United and other historic worldwide brands less hindered in the transfer market because of their ability to attract 'global noodles partners'.\n\nCity, meanwhile, have suffered genuine punishment under FFP, loaning out Alvaro Negredo because their Champions League squad has been cut from 25 players to 21.\n\nIt's also true that the fixture list has not been kind to City. They must peg back an energised Chelsea when the two title \u00adfavourites clash this Sunday.\n\nYet Pellegrini dare not rest players at Bayern's Allianz Arena tomorrow because City need a European ego boost, while Roma and CSKA Moscow hardly look like \u00adpushovers.\n\nPellegrini did a lot right last season - but winning the title with comfortably the best squad in the Premier League is one thing; conquering Europe is City's final frontier and Pellegrini must go boldly.\n\nIn the 2-2 draw at Arsenal, City played like champions , unfortunate not to defeat a vibrant home side - even if their failure to do so was hardly Clattenburg's fault.\n\nNobody doubts City on the domestic front but in Europe, the old inferiority complex still exists.\n\nLast season, they improved on their dismal Champions League showings under Mancini, yet they were still far too timid in key home matches against Bayern Munich and Barcelona, ending up well beaten in both. Pellegrini has enjoyed relative success in the competition, taking rookies Villarreal and Malaga further than City have yet to go.\n\nNow he must convince his players and supporters that they not only belong in club football's grandest competition but that they are capable of winning the thing.\n\nA team with the \u00adleadership qualities of Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure should never feel cowered.\n\nA team containing World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo \u00adZabaleta and Martin Demichelis should never be overawed.\n\nA team which possesses the cunning of David Silva and the pace of Jesus Navas should never play in shackles.\n\nThe Allianz Arena is the perfect place to prove all this - against Bayern's sainted manager and a team dripping with World Cup winners' medals.\n\nWhen Pep Guardiola took over the European champions last year, Bayern were meant to become invincible. Instead they looked vulnerable against David Moyes' United before being hammered by Real Madrid. These are no superhumans and Pellegrini cannot treat them as such.\n\nAs the operatic singer clears her throat to screech out the Champions League's apocalyptic theme, Chelsea look the most likely English winners - the 2012 winners now armed with Cesc Fabregas and last season's Atletico Madrid trio of Diego Costa, Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis.\n\nPoll loading ...\n\nLiverpool look most likely to overachieve - especially with Anfield's atmosphere the polar opposite to the edginess of the Etihad on a European night.\n\nArsenal will reach the last 16 and lose as they always do and nobody will mind.\n\nBut City are the club who need it most. This is no time to be shy.", "Arsenal's defensive resources for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund are being severely tested after Arsene Wenger ruled out Nacho Monreal and rated Calum Chambers only 50-50.\n\nMonreal failed to travel to Germany because of a back problem while Chambers has succumbed to tonsillitis and will be assessed again on Tuesday morning.\n\nIt potentially leaves Arsenal without three full-backs as Mathieu Debuchy, who was already suspended for the Group D opener, faces an extended spell on the sidelines because of an ankle problem.\n\nChambers had been earmarked to replace Debuchy but should he fail to recover, 19-year-old Spaniard Hector Bellerin will add to his solitary senior appearance for the Gunners.\n\nWenger is confident Bellerin can plug the gap at the BVB Stadium Dortmund. Kieran Gibbs will start at left-back in place of Monreal.\n\n\"In defence we are....the Debuchy injury has put us in a position where we don't want more injuries,\" Wenger said.\n\n\"We have Bellerin who I think is now ready to play. He's a boy with personality who isn't fazed by the pressure.\n\n\"That's a very important quality when you're a young boy playing at a big club. His transition game is fantastic. He's very quick and his final ball is good as well.\n\n\"He lacks a bit of experience as a defender, but he's very dangerous going forward.\"\n\nWenger's refusal to add to his defence during the summer - he signed Chambers but sold Thomas Vermaelen - may now come back to haunt him with Debuchy facing an extended spell in the treatment room.\n\nThe Frenchman was stretchered off with ligament damage in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium and reports state he could be missing for up to three months.\n\n\"Debuchy is out for a longer period. We don't know how long yet. We hoped to have good news after his scan today (Monday),\" Wenger said.\n\n\"We have Chambers who can play in different positions and Monreal can play in different positions.\"\n\nArsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny is disappointed by the loss of Debuchy, but is happy to play behind a rejigged defence.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to lose such an important player,\" Szczesny said.\n\n\"He's had a very strong start to the season and is a very experienced right-back. Hopefully he'll be back as soon as possible.\n\n\"It doesn't matter which defenders play in front of me because we're used to communicating in training, so it's not an issue.\"\n\nWenger insists any benefit of arriving in Dortmund with three German internationals in Arsenal's squad - Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski - is offset by the familiarity between the club rivals.\n\nIt is the third time in four seasons they have clashed and Wenger said: \"It's not such an advantage to have three German players in the squad because we know Dortmund anyway.

So it's not like the club really had an alternative unless they forced him to stay, which would not have worked.\n\nIn the case of Di Maria there was a financial element. He wanted to stay, no doubt, but with the way Real Madrid play he would not have been happy on the bench and it would have been a very expensive player to keep in reserve.\n\n\"Carlo Ancelotti is saying they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like a diesel car, so it takes a while for it to start going fast.\"\n\nGuillem Balague\n\nThat's the thinking of the club - I'm not saying I agree with it, but that's their thinking and they had to make a decision.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti is saying they're like a diesel car, so it takes a while for it to start going fast. The players are intelligent and have got quality, and they will have to adapt to their new positions.\n\nToni Kroos is certainly going to be crucial in front of the defence, playing the role he plays for Germany, but he didn't play that way with Bayern last season.\n\nJames Rodriguez will have to adapt to the midfield position which he played as a kid - on the left-hand side, working hard to track back as he used to do - but also he might be able to play as a number 10 depending on how the formation evolves.\n\nIn the meantime, there seems to be a lack of intensity and concentration from everybody and 30 minutes of good football against Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid is certainly not enough, so that's the job Ancelotti has got on his hands.\n\nFluidity\n\nAtletico Madrid beat Real Madrid this weekend and are continuing to play the same way as they did last season, with one addition now they've got Arda Turan back into the team.\n\nHe's the only one I feel that can link up the attack with fluidity. Otherwise they play long balls too often, and too often the team loses control of the ball.\n\nThe substitutions were great and Turan and Antoine Griezmann gave Diego Simeone what he wanted, because the first half - regardless of the result - was poor from Atletico Madrid.\n\nNeymar scores for Barcelona against Athletic Bilbao\n\nAs for Barcelona, Luis Enrique is bringing back the intensity into their training.\n\nHe also gives USB sticks to players to take back home - unlike the hand-written notes of Tata Martino. That's a move forward to a more modern approach, a more individual approach to both thinking about training and about the game.\n\nBasically he is being like Big Brother, where the players have to think he is on top of them constantly, and he is, both on the bench and in training, and they are doing what he wants.\n\nThey pressure high and the forwards are close to Lionel Messi - they play inside instead of wide and that needs constant movement and constant running in behind the defence. Both Munir and Pedro did that this weekend.\n\nNeymar added something else, a little bit of chaos at the right time, but I want to see him making those runs in behind the defence. Rather than running with the ball so often, he needs to work hard off the ball. We have yet to see that because he hasn't had much continuity in the team.\n\nIt's still in the early stages but it's so far, so good for them.\n\nGuillem answers your questions...\n\nGot a question for Guillem?

I do believe he is thinking of going back, but there will undoubtedly be more on that later!\n\nFALSE DAWN\n\nHi Guillem, Valencia and Sevilla have both started solidly. Could you see them doing an Atleti and being up there at the end of the season? Dan Simpson\n\nGUILLEM SAYS: I think it's a slightly false dawn from Valencia. They will be more competitive than last season but in the game against Malaga there was the sending off of Sergi Darder around minute 27, and that helped Valencia. Against Espanyol they could have been 1-1, a disallowed goal, and again they struggled. They defend too deep - they have to come further up the pitch and that will take time, but they're still miles away from Atletico Madrid.\n\nSevilla are the same. They are trying to replace Ivan Rakitic but they still haven't got the perfect combination. Denis Suarez is the organiser but he moves wide too often and hasn't got the continuity of that kind of midfielder yet. With Ever Banega still not fit to play 90 minutes yet they've got to work on control of the ball and control of the game. Again, they will be more competitive than last season, no doubt, but they will be fighting for fourth position with Valencia and a few others.", "Manuel Pellegrini has challenged Aguero to win the Ballon d'Or - but how does he compare with last year's shortlisted players Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery\n\nManuel Pellegrini has challenged Aguero to win the Ballon d'Or - but does he have the stats required to win football's top prize?\n\nThe Argentine forward has started the season well, scoring three goals in 186 minutes.\n\nThat's one every 62 minutes - better than last year's three finalists have managed so far this season.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has scored one every 90 minutes in La Liga for Real Madrid, while Lionel Messi has scored just one league goal every 135 minutes for Barcelona.

The systems are not the key - they were maybe 10-15 years ago\".\n\nFor Klinsmann, the fact that midfielders become forwards when their teams have the ball means that talk of a 'lone striker' or 'two up front' is meaningless.\n\nThere was no better example of that than United's win on Sunday with Juan Mata and Di Maria frequently featuring in dangerous positions near the opposition goal and Wayne Rooney happy to drop deeper at times.\n\nBlind and Ander Herrera had mainly defensive responsibilities in midfield and the other four attacking players were charged with different roles. So 4-4-2, 4-3-3 or 4-2-4?\n\nThe new-look United are by no means alone in this approach.\n\nNone of Chelsea's trio of Oscar, Eden Hazard and Andre Schuerrle could be simply described as midfielders or strikers and Liverpool's Raheem Sterling does not fit easily into one category.\n\nThe days when dividing 10 by three was a useful way of describing a team's approach are probably over.\n\nAnd with Colombian striker Falcao still to be integrated, Van Gaal is unlikely to make himself a prisoner of numbers.", "Monreal failed to travel to Germany because of a back problem while Chambers has succumbed to tonsillitis and will be assessed again on Tuesday morning.\n\nIt potentially leaves Arsenal without three full-backs as Mathieu Debuchy, who was already suspended for the Group D opener, faces an extended spell on the sidelines because of an ankle problem.\n\nChambers had been earmarked to replace Debuchy but should he fail to recover, 19-year-old Spaniard Hector Bellerin will add to his solitary senior appearance for the Gunners.\n\nWenger is confident Bellerin can plug the gap at the BVB Stadium Dortmund. Kieran Gibbs will start at left-back in place of Monreal.\n\n\"In defence we are....the Debuchy injury has put us in a position where we don't want more injuries,\" Wenger said.\n\n\"We have Bellerin who I think is now ready to play. He's a boy with personality who isn't fazed by the pressure.\n\n\"That's a very important quality when you're a young boy playing at a big club. His transition game is fantastic. He's very quick and his final ball is good as well.\n\n\"He lacks a bit of experience as a defender, but he's very dangerous going forward.\"\n\nWenger's refusal to add to his defence during the summer - he signed Chambers but sold Thomas Vermaelen - may now come back to haunt him with Debuchy facing an extended spell in the treatment room.\n\nThe Frenchman was stretchered off with ligament damage in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium and reports state he could be missing for up to three months.\n\n\"Debuchy is out for a longer period. We don't know how long yet. We hoped to have good news after his scan today (Monday),\" Wenger said.\n\n\"We have Chambers who can play in different positions and Monreal can play in different positions.\"\n\nArsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny is disappointed by the loss of Debuchy, but is happy to play behind a rejigged defence.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to lose such an important player,\" Szczesny said.\n\n\"He's had a very strong start to the season and is a very experienced right-back. Hopefully he'll be back as soon as possible.\n\n\"It doesn't matter which defenders play in front of me because we're used to communicating in training, so it's not an issue.\"\n\nWenger insists any benefit of arriving in Dortmund with three German internationals in Arsenal's squad - Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski - is offset by the familiarity between the club rivals.\n\nIt is the third time in four seasons they have clashed and Wenger said: \"It's not such an advantage to have three German players in the squad because we know Dortmund anyway.

I think we've got a really strong squad that can challenge for more trophies and more success in the Champions League this season.

I like it.'\n\nFollowing a 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emirates on Saturday, Arsenal can take positives into the clash with Dortmund.\n\nDanny Welbeck had a promising debut despite being unable to find the net and Jack Wilshere was particularly impressive.\n\nBut Wenger is cautious about using all his German World Cup-winning players from the start, believing Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski are not yet fully match fit.\n\nWenger said: 'The (World Cup) final in Rio was July 13. They came back on the August 11. That means I gave them one month of holiday.", "Arsenal face Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night as they kick off their Champions League group with yet another difficult looking fixture.\n\nWith Arsenal being away and Dortmund being a very strong side, many would be happy to see the Gunners coming away with a point from this game. However, I think this is a very winnable game for an Arsenal side that is growing in confidence. Here's three reasons I think they will defeat Dortmund.\n\n1. Arsenal are unbeaten in their last six trips to Germany\n\nThe Gunners have a very good away record in general, but in Germany it's very good. They've not lost in their last six trips to Germany, and considering that's included a couple of games against Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, that record looks even more impressive. Arsenal will go into the game thinking they can take all three points, and that would mark a very good start to the group. When you have these kind of records it is no coincidence. Arsene Wenger knows how to tactically approach such difficult fixtures.\n\n2. Alexis Sanchez is on fire\n\nAlexis kicked off his goalscoring run by putting Arsenal into the Champions League group stages when he netted against Besiktas. Since then he has scored twice in the Premier League, including a spectacular goal against Manchester City on Saturday. He's on great form and keeps popping up with decisive goals, Wenger will hope he can make the difference once again on Tuesday. His work rate makes him an important component in a team looking to tackle a well-drilled Dortmund side. Everyone needs to be giving 100 per cent to take all three points from this game, you can be sure Alexis will be.\n\n3. The Gunners are packed with pace\n\nPace is always useful, but especially in away games. Arsenal are rarely pushed back into their half by opposition but Dortmund have the tools to do that. Whilst being in your own half is dangerous, it also presents an opportunity. If Arsenal can get the ball to their quick players like Alexis, Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, they can counter extremely effectively. Whilst Theo Walcott is yet to return, Arsenal still have plenty of pace in their armoury to hurt Dortmund.\n\nMORE: Three players who can help Arsenal's defensive crisis after Mathieu Debuchy injury blow", "Vincent Kompany wants Manchester City to show no fear in their UEFA Champions League Group E campaign opener at Bayern Munich.\n\nThe Premier League champions are paired with their German counterparts in Europe's elite competition for the second season running.\n\nHaving bowed out at the group stage in their previous two Champions League excursions, the signs were ominous as Bayern trampled early season optimism at the Etihad Stadium last term, leaving Manchester with a swashbuckling 3-1 victory.\n\nBut City bounced back to win their next four European games, including a thrilling 3-2 comeback triumph at the Allianz Arena.\n\nA last-16 exit at the hands of another heavyweight, Barcelona, followed, although City captain Kompany believes his team-mates have nothing to prove as they prepare for a return to Bavaria.\n\n\"We're confident,\" the Belgium defender told reporters. \"This is the first game of the Champions League, an away game against one of the hardest teams to play against in the world right now.\n\n\"But we should take confidence out of the last game we played in Munich.

And Guardiola voiced concerns over the weekend that too great a burden could fall on fellow Spaniard Xabi Alonso.\n\nThe former Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder has enjoyed a seamless transition since his close-season move to Bayern and impressed in Saturday's 2-0 Bundesliga win over Stuttgart.\n\nBayern's injury problems are not limited to midfield, with further doubts surrounding influential attacking duo Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben.\n\nRobben missed training on Sunday with a knee complaint and match fitness could be an issue for Ribery, despite the former France international marking his season debut with a goal from the bench at the weekend.\n\nDefender Holger Badstuber requires surgery after tearing a thigh muscle against Stuttgart to hand Guardiola more problems as Bayern attempt to bounce back from the disappointment of being thrashed 5-0 on aggregate by Real in the Champions League semi-finals last season.", "Louis van Gaal is clear in his ambition to reclaim the Premier League for United. After the 4-0 mauling of QPR on Sunday - his first win as manager of the club - the Dutchman stated that he \"wanted to win the Premier League,\" before adding, \"If it is not this year, then the second or third year.\"\n\nIf Van Gaal was to climb to the top of the Premier League summit this season, he would replicate the feat that he achieved at Barcelona and Bayern Munich where he won league titles in his first season as manager.\n\nThe glut of signings appear to have vastly improved United's squad, even down to the defence which was flimsy at best for Van Gaal's first four outings as manager. Chief executive, Ed Woodward has given Van Gaal a clear target of a top three finish this season, and whilst the victory wasn't against the strongest of opposition, it should give supporters cause for optimism. Van Gaal claimed that United can do better, despite hailing the \"fantastic\" performance on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe weekend's result saw Van Gaal drop his desired three at the back formation in favour of a back four and midfield diamond approach, which appeared to suit new signings, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria, as well as Marcos Rojo who played at left-back. It worked, with Di Maria and Herrera both scoring: and the watershed moment is \"just the beginning\", according to the manager.\n\nThis is due to the apparent \"lack of match fitness\" amongst the squad, with the likes of Rafael, Falcao all returning from injury. Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo played despite being short of match practice and Luke Shaw was promoted to the bench after a lay-off. The injury list is still drawn out for Van Gaal's side, with defensive frailties hidden under the surface through Chris Smalling and Phil Jones' unavailability.\n\nUnited have had poor starts to the season and ended up bouncing back to win the league and other successes, can they realistically top the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City domestically this year?", "Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has laid the blame of his failure to deliver the Champions League for Real Madrid at the feet of Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe Portuguese duo spent three years at the Santiago Bernabeu together from 2010 to 2013 before Mourinho left for Stamford Bridge.\n\nReal came closest to winning Europe's premier club competition in 2012 when they were eliminated on penalties by eventual runners-up Bayern Munich.\n\nRonaldo - who won his second Ballon d'Or in January - took Real's first spot-kick and missed it, before Kaka and Sergio Ramos also failed to score.\n\n'Winning the Champions twice as coach has made my career a special one,' Mourinho, who lifted the Champions League with Porto and Inter Milan, told TVI24.\n\n'I've been in several semi-finals too and some defeats were especially hard to take, such as the goal that did not exist against Liverpool [during his first Chelsea spell in 2005 or on penalties in 2012 when our first-choice penalty taker [Ronaldo] went up first and failed.'", "Van Gaal exceeded expectations at the World Cup, leading the Netherlands to the semi-finals with a system that featured three central defenders.\n\nWhen United began life under Van Gaal on their pre-season tour of the United States, the Dutchman unveiled a 3-5-2 formation which quickly won praise.\n\nThat was the formation that took the field for United's first home game of the Premier League season, against Swansea City, but it lasted just 45 minutes as injuries forced a switch to a more familiar 4-4-2 line-up during the 2-1 defeat.\n\nWith the addition of Daley Blind, Angel Di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao during the final days of the transfer window last month, Van Gaal should not need to change formation due to lack of options.\n\nBut it is the abundance of attacking talent at his disposal that is likely to lead to a pragmatic approach to formation.\n\nFor while pundits have obsessed throughout the past two months about 'three at the back', the Dutchman has always been clear that there are many different formations he can deploy.\n\nEven after the triumphant debut of his new system in the 7-0 win over L.A Galaxy in Pasadena, Van Gaal pointed out that he was flexible.\n\n\"I can change back if the system doesn't work,\" he said.\n\nWhat Van Gaal appeared to be doing during pre-season was making sure his team were familiar with a system that he has used so that they could add that option to the formations that were already part of their football educations.\n\n\"They know already the other system (4-4-2 or 4-3-3); they have played that from their youth, so that's easy,\" he said during the tour, before quickly adding a reminder that even with the Netherlands he was never reluctant to alternate.\n\n\"You saw that in the game against Mexico - I'm sorry to say that when we were 1-0 down I changed the system to 4-3-3 and then we beat them,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, United's second attempt at a re-launch was an entertaining 4-0 rout of Queens Park Rangers using an 'old-fashioned' four-man defence.\n\nPRAGMATIC REASONING\n\nAgain Van Gaal answered the inevitable questions with pragmatic reasoning.\n\n\"I could hardly play with five defenders because (Chris) Smalling and (Phil) Jones were injured,\" he said.\n\nThe debate over formations is, in any case, becoming meaningless in modern football.\n\nWhile commentators and analysts talk of various combinations of numbers and midfield 'diamonds' the reality is that the game has changed enormously, with individual players covering so much more of the field, meaning that strict definitions of 'lines' is close to being obsolete.\n\nThe role of the full back has been transformed over the past decade and it is often hard to define whether they should be counted as part of a back line or a midfield.\n\nBefore the World Cup, former Germany coach and current United States head coach Juergen Klinsmann challenged the fixation.\n\n\"It always sounds cool when you talk about 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 or 4-4-2 diamond but it's actually useless,\" said the former Bayern Munich and Tottenham forward.\n\n\"All these discussions...are not up to speed anymore.

Photograph: Nicky Loh/Getty Images\n\nRio Ferdinand has come down heavily on heavily on former Manchester United manager David Moyes saying 'his innovative training sessions led to negativity and confusions'.\n\nThe veteran Manchester United defender, who now plays for Queens Park Rangers, also revealed that Moyes made the team train in public parks and banned eating chips.\n\nThe Scotsman, who was relieved of his duties after just before the end of last season at Old Trafford, endured a torrid time during his brief United tenure, and former defender Ferdinand has given an insight into how Moyes lost the dressing room in his new autobiography #2sides.\n\nSpeaking about the club's preparations before United's huge Champions League clash against Bayern Munich last season, Ferdinand said: \"On the morning of the game everything seemed wrong. To practise our set pieces and stuff we went to a public park. It was bizarre! Local people started coming from all over to watch us and take photos and videos.\n\n\"It was amateurish. I mean, why not just send Bayern an email or a DVD?\"\n\nThe now-QPR centre back also revealed how Moyes's sweeping changes to United traditions left the player destabilised and unhappy.\n\n'We complained, but nothing changed'\n\nRio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans of Manchester United compete for the ball as team manager David Moyes watches during a training session at the Aon Training Complex in Manchester on Monday. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\n\"Footballers are creatures of habit and for as long as I can remember at United, it was a ritual that we had low-fat chips the night before a game. We loved our chips,\" Ferdinand wrote in his book, which is being serialised in The Sun.\n\n\"But Moyes comes in and, after his first week, he says we can't have chips any more. We weren't eating badly. In fact, you'd struggle to find a more professional bunch of players than the ones at Manchester United in the summer of 2013. Moyes's innovations mostly led to negativity and confusion,\" he added.\n\nHe also stressed about how routines in traditional practice games were changed.\n\n\"Under Fergie, for example, before a game on a Saturday we always played a small-sided match on a small pitch on the Friday. We loved it. We'd get into the mood for the following day by expressing ourselves, having fun, trying stuff out. You got your touch right, experimented, got the feeling flowing.\n\nWe'd done that for years and suddenly -- again for no good reason -- Moyes changed it by making us play two-touch. It was especially bad for the forwards who liked to practise their skills and shots and movements. They felt restricted. You'd come off the pitch feeling blocked, frustrated, like you hadn't had a chance to express yourself. We complained but nothing changed,\" he added.\n\nFerdinand brands Terry's racial row against brother Anton 'idiotic'\n\nJohn Terry and Anton Ferdinand. Photograph: Reuters\n\nFerdinand also said that Chelsea captain John Terry acted like an idiot over the incident three years ago in which the skipper was accused of racially abusing the former Manchester United defender's brother Anton.\n\nFerdinand expressed a deep sense of betrayal at the actions of his former England teammate, claiming that his international career was wrecked in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nFollowing a five-day trial at Westminster magistrates' court in July 2012, Terry was absolved of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand in a heated exchange during a west London derby at Loftus Road the previous October, The Guardian reported.\n\nTerry had been accused of calling his opponent a 'f***ing black c***', a claim the skipper denied, telling the court that he was simply repeating words he believed Anton Ferdinand had said to him as they argued.\n\nAn FA hearing subsequently found Terry guilty of racial abuse, imposing a four-game ban and a 2,20,000 pounds fine on the Chelsea defender.\n\nRio Ferdinand was omitted from Roy Hodgson's England squad for Euro 2012 amid fears that the inclusion of both players might have a divisive effect, although the manager claimed it was for football reasons. That effectively signalled the end of Ferdinand's international career, the player announcing his retirement the following May.\n\nFerdinand said that for him the biggest idiot will always be Terry, adding that as England captain and his centre-back partner he could have saved everyone a lot of pain by admitting immediately he used the word in the heat of the moment, but was no racist.\n\nThe veteran defender said that he thinks think that's probably what happened and what the truth is, adding that he and Anton would have accepted that. Instead, Ferdinand said that Terry never gave them a chance and that was the betrayal.", "The Champions League is back and we can't wait to get started.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's opening group games in Europe's biggest club competition, we take you through everything you need to know.\n\nCan Real Madrid retain its title?

(Birmingham Mail)", "Napoli's denim shirt and women's cycling kit in Colombia show stupid mix of football and fashion\n\nWith his club bottom of the Premier League, the supporters in open revolt and his manager a touchline lightning rod for furious discontent, it is hard to make a case for Mike Ashley right now.\n\nThe owner of Newcastle United seems to bounce from one bad call to another. Joe Kinnear directing football, the renamed Sports Direct Arena, a transfer policy that is either feast or famine, so little of what has unfolded during the Ashley years on Tyneside makes sense. Consistency is absent.\n\nA season or more of stagnation might be followed by a sudden whirlwind of activity, with little rationale for either. One minute Ashley is awarding eight-year contracts to senior coaching staff, the next he is cancelling their basic complimentary ticket allowance.\n\nNewcastle sell their best players and almost wantonly failed to capitalise on a fifth-place finish in 2012. They could have been relegated the following season.\n\nAshley came into football to have fun, it was said, but barely goes to matches now. He turned up for a rare away game at Southampton last Saturday only for Newcastle to lose 4-0. For Alan Pardew, his manager, it was thought to be the bitter end. The fury of the travelling support was loud and unrelenting. This was surely the point of no return.\n\nYet it is in these moments that Ashley becomes grudgingly commendable. Rejecting the latest round of speculation about Pardew's future, it has again been made clear who calls the shots. Ashley, for all his flaws, remains steadfastly sure of one thing: Newcastle are his club, and he alone will decide Pardew's fate. He will not be bullied, rattled or goaded into action. He will not bend.\n\nThere is little about Newcastle that impresses these days, but this does. There are increasingly few owners willing to resist an angry mob in the age of social media. Ashley's bloody-mindedness sets him apart.\n\nDavid Pleat called it, several seasons ago. 'If the fans chant, \"Sack the manager\", they think about sacking the manager,' he said. 'If the fans chant, \"Sack the board\", they definitely sack the manager.'\n\nNewcastle's fans have been chanting for Ashley to go almost from the day he arrived and, at first, he seemed anxious to win them over. His early managerial appointments, certainly Kevin Keegan and then Alan Shearer as a stop-gap, were obvious crowd pleasers. Yet Newcastle went down and he got it in the neck anyway. His stance since has hardened, particularly over Pardew, who would almost certainly have been sacked by the majority of Premier League chairmen by now and not just because Newcastle are yet to win a game this season, or flirted with relegation in their last campaign.\n\nPut simply, most chairmen would have gone for the popular vote, whether or not privately they thought it was the right call. Ashley is never going to be loved on Tyneside, but he could make friends quite quickly by sacking Pardew. The new manager would at least enjoy a honeymoon period and, if successful, some of his sparkle might rub off on Ashley's regime, too. After all, there were not many demonstrations against the Cockney Mafia the season Pardew took the club to fifth in the league.\n\nInstead, Ashley eschews populist action. Many say he does not want to pay the compensation due on Pardew's lengthy contract, yet that agreement is bound to have breaks and pauses. He would have been mad to have offered an eight-year deal that had to be fully paid up in the event of a parting.\n\nAnyway, if it is only a hefty pay-off that keeps Pardew employed, Ashley had his chance to wriggle out last season. On March 1, Pardew was sent to the stands for head-butting David Meyler of Hull City, eventually receiving a seven-match ban. Had Ashley wanted to ditch him, he could have done so then, under the guise of gross misconduct, probably without paying a penny. So it cannot just be about the money.\n\nAmid the present crisis, Ashley would be more widely respected if he fronted up by attending the home games, rather than leaving Pardew to stand alone, but his stance still requires nerve. When Kevin McCabe sacked Bryan Robson at Sheffield United in 2008, he admitted bowing to external pressure.\n\n'Were it not for a small percentage of our fans making life pretty intolerable for Bryan I was hoping he would stay on board with us as our head of football,' McCabe said. 'I am disappointed our supporters couldn't be a bit more patient because I know better than anyone the tremendous work Bryan and Brian Kidd were doing. Sometimes the people the fans abuse are doing so many good things for the club.'\n\nSo don't sack them, then. If McCabe knew that Robson was doing a decent job why not just explain this, and deal with the pressure? This is not the modern way, sadly. It didn't take too many fly-pasts at Old Trafford for David Moyes's six-year contract to become just another deal to be signed off, and when supporters at West Ham United demanded attacking football, it was the board, not Sam Allardyce, who promised to deliver.\n\nMore than ever, clubs are sensitive to every song, tweet or Facebook group that is passing comment. Indeed, a manager might not even get through the door if the owner senses a bad vibe.\n\nSteve McClaren, a very able coach tainted by his poor performance as England manager, is at Derby County now because they are one of the few clubs where mention of his name does not provoke disapproval. He came close to bigger, better jobs, only for talks to go cold when news leaked and his employer became unnerved by negative reaction. It is no coincidence that he is now being linked with Newcastle, either.\n\nOf course, it can be argued that it is a lot easier to ignore a gathering of angry Geordies from the safety of a casino in Mayfair. Ashley would cut a more impressive figure if he travelled north to face the music once in a while. Yet he is far from the only absentee owner in the Premier League, and his stubborn stance is what maintains the divide. Ashley could sack Pardew and go to watch games again. No matter how thick-skinned, his isolation cannot be uplifting. He is unable to enjoy an investment that was in part made in the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nSome think a good owner listens to the fans, but that isn't strictly true. He respects the fans, and the traditions of the club, and he does not relocate it to Northampton or Milton Keynes, or mess with its name and colours. Yet a football club is not a democracy. How can it be when there are 50,000 in the ground? The supporters should have a voice and are entitled to an opinion, but how can the owner pay heed when views are so diverse?\n\nThe majority at Newcastle want Pardew out, but is that 49,999 against one, or 25,001 versus 24,999? A vox pop on replacements will throw up 50 different names and no business can be run like The X Factor. Someone has to make the final call. Yes, Ashley often goes too far in his willingness to be confrontational -- the renaming of St James' Park as the Sports Direct Arena was a travesty and deserving of contempt -- but on the manager he is dead right. It has to be his decision, and he has to be defiant and remain unmoved as the storm rages.\n\nThe mood will be ugly again on Saturday when Newcastle play Hull City, managed by Steve Bruce, another candidate as Pardew's successor. The fans will take their frustration out on Pardew, and may even sing for his opposite number. Defeat could mark his last game.\n\nYet if that is the case, he will still be leaving on Ashley's terms, and to Ashley's schedule. There will be no playing to the gallery. This is Ashley's saving grace. He will never be an easy man to defend but, of all the Premier League owners, he is the one still prepared to take the heat as the big, bad, unpopular boss. Credit him for that, at least.\n\nFA lost chance to settle Terry and Rio row\n\nA final thought on the toxic fall-out between Rio Ferdinand and John Terry. Might the Football Association have been able to broker a rapprochement? Here were two players who had stood side by side through countless internationals.\n\nWith Ferdinand now saying he sought a quick resolution, a simple apology, and did not consider Terry a racist, was there not more common ground than was previously assumed?\n\nThe police involvement was the prime complication, yet even this may not have been insurmountable. In a less complicated era, matters on the football field were invariably handled by the FA alone. The police did not want to be involved every time two players got into a fight, and the FA did not want confrontations to end up in court.\n\nAs long as the FA guaranteed stiff discipline and justice, the police were happy to keep their distance. It is the reason Paul Davis of Arsenal was not prosecuted for breaking Southampton midfielder Glenn Cockerill's jaw in 1988.\n\nCould the FA have told the police that they would deal with Terry? Did they even try? At the time, it more appeared that they backed off the moment the police were involved. Most likely the nature of the offence would have left them terrified; frightened to be thought complacent, or accused of going soft and ignoring racial sensitivities if they merely tried to bring the sides together.\n\nYet a less punitive, swifter and more positive resolution is what Ferdinand says he wanted. Why, three years on, is the wound still sore? Why, so long after, does it continue to feel like there could have been a better way?\n\nThe battle between 'good and evil' at the Allianz Arena\n\nManchester City have their annual meeting with Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, a fixture traditionally presented as the battle between good and evil.\n\nIn the red corner, lovely self-sufficient Munich, home to tax cheats and financial fair play; in the blue corner, City, whose advancement is bankrolled by foreign investment. Boo.\n\nUEFA fined City \u00a350million for breaking FFP rules last season, yet rather than distribute this windfall throughout the European leagues to narrow the gap between rich and poor, the wealthy elite of the European Club Association decided it should be split between those who qualified for European football.\n\nA common argument in favour of FFP is that the rule-breaking of teams like City will have prevented a smaller club breaking into the Champions League or Europa League. So will such a deserving cause benefit?\n\nNo. Just the clubs who got in anyway: Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea -- the usual suspects. No cut will ever be too big for them, no grasping hand too great. Head of the ECA is Karl-Heinz Rummenigge of Bayern Munich. 'It was money belonging to the clubs,' he said. Of course it was -- just not all of them, as usual.\n\nMix fashion with sport to produce naked stupidity\n\nNapoli's away kit is denim this season. Last year, it was army camouflage. This is all part of the desire to produce a shirt as fashion accessory.\n\nIt was the brainstorm behind the horrid grey kits once sported by England and Manchester United, and is the reason so many teams change to black these days, too. What goes best with jeans, ask the manufacturers. And another little piece of your club dies on the drawing board of a marketing man's office.\n\n(Having said this, Napoli's denim is not as humiliating as the kit of the Bogota Humana women's cycling team from Colombia that makes them look naked from the waist down. Stupidity, more than sexism, would appear to be at work here, as the men's outfit is little different.", "Bayern Munich play Manchester City in their opening match on Wednesday\n\nOnly once he was away from the carnival of Rio de Janeiro did Manuel Neuer quite realise the magnitude of what he achieved this summer.\n\nOf course, any footballer would recognise that climbing the steps of the Maracana Stadium to lift the World Cup was the landmark moment in their professional lives.\n\nThe subsequent public acclamation in Berlin at The Brandenburg Gate -- where the victorious Germany team were greeted by more than a million fans -- certainly enforced the point.\n\nYet it was only when Neuer went on holiday that the size of the triumph became truly clear.\n\n'I didn't know how long we would be in the World Cup, so I hadn't booked any time away beforehand,' said the Bayern Munich goalkeeper. 'Then I decided to go away in Europe, a last-minute holiday\n\n'Never before has there been such hype when I was on holiday. I was just so surprised about what happened. Wherever I went, there were hordes of Germans. Everyone was on a high and celebrating. On holiday, everybody was asking for a photo. I loved doing it but there was not much privacy.'\n\nNeuer is the man Manchester City must get past on Wednesday, a formidable last line of defence for Bayern and Germany.\n\nHis career had already been somewhat spectacular: he won the treble of German league and cup and Champions League in 2013 and then the World Club Cup the same year; he won the league and cup double with Bayern in 2014. But the 1-0 win over Argentina is clearly the culmination of the 28-year-old's achievements in the game.\n\n'As I went up the stairs in Rio to get the World Cup, my thought was, \"How easy it is to climb up these stairs when you have won.\" After we had lost to Chelsea (in the 2012 Champions League final) it was more like a horror story. Your legs feel heavy as lead, so does your head. It's no fun to go up then.'\n\nThe summer not only confirmed him as the world's greatest goalkeeper -- a worthy heir to Germany's Sepp Maier and Oliver Kahn -- but also as the pioneer of a new style. The 'sweeper-keeper' phrase has been around for a while but it took Neuer in the World Cup to demonstrate just what it can mean.\n\nIn the 2-1 win against Algeria, when Germany were forcing the pace of the game, Neuer covered six kilometres, effectively operating as an extra member of the defence 'I had games like that before,' said Neuer. 'But as far as the World Cup is concerned, it attracts more attention. People might get the impression that it was something new but a keeper remains a keeper even when he operates further up field. A keeper has to adjust his game to the team. If the team moves further up, he has to do the same. It's nothing I've invented.\n\n'It is something that comes naturally. Everybody knows I like it and I can somehow deliver that style. But, again, it all happens because the coach wants to play a certain way and it is better for the team.\n\n'I have always been interested in finding new ways to play and have looked at handball keepers and ice hockey goal-minders. It helps me.'\n\nThere was of course a darker moment in the World Cup final: that charge from goal and the high-knee challenge to the face of Gonzalo Higuain. A stronger referee would have sent Neuer off and awarded a penalty, at which point the story of the summer might have had an entirely differnet conclusion.\n\nNeuer is unrepentant. 'My opinion is still the same as it was after the game: it was no foul and no penalty. I got to the ball and he didn't touch it at all. It was not intentional. I apologised right away. I was aware of the fact that it was a tight situation as I had to take a big risk. I had to take a decision in a split second. As a keeper you can't be afraid. Of course I was aware afterwards that it was painful for him. I clearly went for the ball.'\n\nHis predecessor in the German goal, Kahn, has described Neuer's style as 'harikiri' but Neuer is phlegmatic. 'It can be risky, he is right as far as that is concerned. But it's not about the keeper being a one-man show. The risk I take is one I take for the team. In the end, I'm the one to blame if it does not work. '\n\nHis inspirations have a strong Premier League flavour and he names former Arsenal and Manchester United keepers as key influences. 'It is something I often saw from Jens Lehmann, who won the UEFA Cup in 1997 with my former club Schalke. Internationally, I saw it from the Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar.'\n\nFor now, there is no time for reflecting. Neuer has Wednesday's game against City and a Champions League campaign on which to focus.\n\nThere is a sense that this Bayern team might emulate the Barcelona side which made up the core of Spain's team from 2008-2012.\n\nClub and country dominated football and Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller perhaps have the capability to do the same.\n\n'The Bundesliga and the cup are the basics,' said Neuer. 'But this season we have the chance to play two finals in Berlin. Everybody wants that. It's a great thing to play a final in your capital city.'\n\nHe is referring to the 2015 Champions League final and the German FA Cup final. It feels as though this is Bayern Munich's time once more.", "The gods of the UEFA Champions League draw continue to be ridiculously unkind to Manchester City. For the second consecutive season, they've been drawn with German giants Bayern Munich, who won the tournament two seasons ago. On Wednesday, they play each other in their Champions League opener (FOX Sports 1, 2:45 p.m. ET).\n\nBayern reinforced their team this summer, most notably adding Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer from rivals Borussia Dortmund. They've also signed Juan Bernat, who's been their starting left back all season, and defender Mehdi Benatia, who's probably a week or two off from playing a significant part. Manchester City's big add was defensive midfielder Fernando, who's played more than Fernandinho thus far this year, while Eliaquim Mangala is waiting to make his debut. Bacary Sagna has been a backup thus far, but should get his chance to start Wednesday.\n\nWhile very little has changed in the way City play, Pep Guardiola has made sweeping changes at Bayern. Last season, he played a hybrid of his classic Barcelona style and the high-octane 4-2-3-1 that Jupp Heynckes used to guide the Bavarians to a treble. This season, he's completely revamped the system, playing an odd formation that switches between a back three and four in and out of possession.\n\nPep's side might look like a juggernaut once everyone's healthy and has had time to learn the system, but at the moment, they look a bit shaky. Can City take advantage of their growing pains and spring an upset at the Allianz Arena?\n\nThe Bayern Munich injury list is currently a mile long. Rafinha and Thiago Alcantara are both long-term absentees, while Holger Badstuber picked up a fresh injury over the weekend. Franck Ribery is sitting this one out for unspecified reasons, while new recruit Mehdi Benatia is yet to get fully fit.\n\nCity's injury list is quite a bit shorter. The only player out due to a fitness issue is Stevan Jovetic, while Pablo Zabaleta is suspended.\n\nHolger Badstuber's injury leaves Bayern Munich thin in defense once again. The formation here is mostly irrelevant, both because Bayern take different shapes with and without the ball and because they're extremely fluid. The important thing is Rode, or who plays in his place. If Rode or Gianluca Gaudino starts, it probably means Philipp Lahm is playing on the right. If Arjen Robben or Xherdan Shaqiri starts, Lahm is playing in the middle.\n\nCity's formation is less ambiguous, but there are just as many selection dilemmas. Manuel Pellegrini could opt to deviate from this projected lineup by going more defensive, finding spots for Fernandinho and James Milner over more attacking players, and moving Yaya Toure up the pitch.\n\nHow well do Bayern's players understand their roles? - Completely undefined roles and players who are learning to play with each other don't hurt Bayern against sides like Stuttgart. Even against better teams like Wolfsburg and Schalke, they've looked far superior. But against Manchester City, Bayern's defense will get torched if they don't understand their roles.\n\nAre City just playing for the draw? - We'll be able to tell a lot about City's ambitions from their lineup. Our projected team is a pretty balanced one, but if they start Samir Nasri and two forwards, they might be going all-out for a win. If they start one forward, Yaya Toure, Fernandinho and Fernando, they're probably packing everyone behind the ball and playing for a draw.\n\nMartin Demichelis. Just Martin Demichelis. - It's possible that Eliaquim Mangala is now blended into the side and that he'll get the start in this game, but it's more likely that Pellegrini gives him his debut in the Premier League. Pellegrini trusts Demichelis, and will probably start him alongside Vincent Kompany against Bayern. Demichelis has been surprisingly competent, but is still prone to complete meltdowns, and might find a way to lose this game by himself.", "If ever there was a game to sum up what Arsenal needs to do to catch up in the Champions League then this was it. The English side was bossed from start to finish, carving out only the odd half chance, and could have been on the end of a worse scoreline than 2-0.\n\nMORE: Messi takes flight FIFA '15 trailer | Soccer WAGs | Beautiful fans\n\nLukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker (Getty Images)\n\nGoals either side of halftime from Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang settled the game in Dortmund's favor and those two attacks, and plenty more, illustrated the vast gulf in confidence and ability between Germany's second-best team and England's fourth.\n\nArsenal played like a team intent on limiting the damage right from the off. The Gunners were overwhelmed from the opening minutes and were forced into a high number of errors. This was not the performance of a team unbeaten in its last 14 matches. They were poor and were on the receiving end of their first opening-day Champions League group-stage loss since 2003.\n\nThere may be mitigating circumstances for Arsenal's lackluster showing here - injuries and illnesses - but there was a lack of fight and aptitude from the visiting team in contrast to the kind of ruthless, energetic display we have become accustomed to seeing from Jurgen Klopp's side.\n\nJust as Arsenal was robbed of a number of starters, the Germans, too, were without their key first-team regulars. They have not yet been able to count on World Cup winner Mats Hummels this season while Marco Reus would be a huge loss in any team. Klopp, however, has been able to absorb those blows. He has been playing for a year without his midfield prompter Ilkay Gundogan while Jakub Blaszczykowski, Nuri Sahin and Shinji Kagawa were also unavailable for selection.\n\nCombine all those losses to the fact that Robert Lewandowski has been lost to Bayern Munich and you would be forgiven for thinking that Dortmund is on a hiding to nothing in this year's Champions League. On the evidence of matchday one, however, that would be a mistake.\n\nShorn of quality distributors in the center, Dortmund was rapid on the counterattack. It lured Arsenal into their territory. It won the ball back in its own half and played it forward without delay. Often it was one tackle and one pass that undid the English side. The chief threat was Aubameyang. The Gabon striker's pace and off the ball movement through the middle was simply too much for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny to handle.\n\nDortmund has not been slow to replace its outgoings in the transfer market either. Knowing that Gundogan remains incapacitated and that Sebastian Kehl is another year older, Klopp moved to shore up the midfield area with Matthias Ginter from Freiburg.\n\nIn that same problem position on the other side, Arsenal's Mikel Arteta was too slow to cover Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the rest of the Dortmund contingent. He was a creaking reminder of Arsene Wenger's failure to source alternatives in that position.\n\nIt took Wenger until the last seconds of deadline day to relinquish the stubborn notion that he did not need another striker. Danny Welbeck was added at a cost of 20 million euros but Wenger's comments since his signing from Manchester United suggest that he himself was not wholly convinced of the England man as his solution. Welbeck looks to be still getting up to speed with what is expected of him and remains unsure of the runs to make. Moreover, his teammates, especially Alexis and Mesut Ozil, don't yet know how to cater to him.\n\nContrast that with the haste in which Dortmund covered for the absence of Lewandowski. Immobile, last season's top goal scorer in Serie A, and the highly-proficient Adrian Ramos of Hertha Berlin were added to the Dortmund squad early in the summer. They have had the preseason bedding in with their new teammates and though neither could be said to be a direct replacement for the Pole, both have already been on the scoresheet this season and have given Dortmund another way of playing.\n\nDortmund has Bayern Munich to deal with in its domestic league like Arsenal has Chelsea and Manchester City. Dortmund, like Arsenal, loses players more or less every summer, and is stretched to the limits once injuries begin to bite. It is in essence a good measuring stick for Arsene Wenger of how to manage his resources.\n\nOn the basis of this, the first Champions League tie of the season, Arsenal has a lot of work to do. As things stand, due to Galatasaray's draw with Anderlecht, it is only one point off second place when it could have been three. The Gunners will still probably qualify but to better their level of the last 16, they are going to have to beat better teams than Dortmund.", "Arsenal were outclassed all over the pitch as Dortmund ran them ragged on the way to a 2-0 home win at the Westfalion Stadion Who is Hector Bellerin?

I hope you're looking forward to tonight's game as much as I am - it's sure to be what our American friends refer to as a 'doozy'.\n\nArsenal get their 17th-consecutive Champions League campaign underway tonight after successfully navigating a tricky qualification tie against Besiktas last month.\n\nThe Gunners are in Group D with Borussia Dortmund, Galatasary and Anderlecht. And they open with what is likely to be the most difficult of their six games - the away tie against the Germans.\n\nThese two have plenty of previous and there's never been much to separate them.\n\nLast year, they shared a Champions League group and Arsenal won this fixture 1-0, after losing 2-1 at the Emirates.\n\nTonight is anyone's game with both teams missing players and Arsenal looking particularly light in defence. We'll bring you all the latest team news ahead of kick-off, which is at 7:45pm.\n\n5:54 pm\n\nMuch of the build-up to tonight's game has been dominated by the situation with Arsenal's defence, and it looks like Calum Chambers is likely to miss out after all.\n\nAccording to Arsenal's third-choice goalkeeper Damien Martinez, Hector Bellerin will, in fact, be starting tonight's game - his first competitive match for Arsenal.\n\nAnd what a game to pick for your debut, ahead of one of the best home crowds anywhere in Europe.\n\nGunnerblog's James McNicholas gave us the lowdown on the Spanish 19-year-old ahead of the game and you can read what he said as we count down to kick-off.\n\nHere are a couple of nuggets though: His game is perhaps most similar to current Barcelona right-back Dani Alves, and he's quicker than Thierry Henry and Theo Walcott!\n\nAll the best to my brother @HectorBellerin as he starts his first game for Arsenal #quality pic.twitter.com/0KqVUPBdAr -- Damian Emi Martinez (@emimartinezz1)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n6:18 pm Wenger now the Champions League's most experienced manager\n\nArsenal are no strangers to the Champions League.\n\nThey have, after all, got to this stage every year for the past 17 years and, following Manchester United's failure to qualify, can boast the longest consecutive stay in the elite competition of any English club.\n\nGiven that, it's unsurprising to learn that Arsene Wenger is now the competition's longest-serving manager who is still working.\n\nHe's overseen 160 Champions League games - but is yet to win it, with a sole appearance in the final to his name.\n\nIt's the one trophy missing from his cabinet, but in recent years the Gunners have been accused of doing little more than making up the numbers.\n\nDoes Arsene Wenger have what it takes to win the Champions League before he retires?\n\nThere's three-and-a-half hours until kick off in #BORvAFC, so here's a Matchday Stat to get you in the mood... pic.twitter.com/KCFCj5L1Em -- Arsenal FC (@Arsenal)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n6:25 pm\n\nArsenal are looking typically like Arsenal at the outset of this year's competition.\n\nThere's plenty of promise, particularly following the acquisition of Alexis Sanchez, who is already looking every bit as exciting as Arsenal fans had hoped, with three goals in his last three games including a peach against City at the weekend.\n\nBut that injury-related fatal flaw is already making its pungent presence felt this year - and you have to say, these difficulties are somewhat self-imposed.\n\nWenger sanctioned the sale of Thomas Vermaelen and took the decision to go into the new season with just six first-team defenders, two of whom (Debuchy, Monreal) are definitely out tonight and one who is looking less-and-less likely to make it (Chambers)...\n\nPoll loading ... 6:28 pm Bellerin starts for Arsenal\n\nOur man John Cross is at the BVB Stadion for tonight's game, with kick-off just an hour and twenty minutes away.\n\nAnd the word coming from him is that Hector Bellerin does, indeed, start for Arsenal.\n\nYou may have seen him catching the eye during the Gunners' pre-season a couple of months ago - he looked particularly good against Benfica in the Emirates Cup.\n\nOf course, this is an altogether different proposition for the 19-year-old...\n\nBellerin to start for #afc.

He is a very different proposition back at Dortmund. -- gunnerblog (@gunnerblog)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n7:04 pm Flamini misses out\n\nOne player not in the squad who may have been expected to start given the attacking potency of the opposition is Mathieu Flamini.\n\nThe Frenchman, who has been filling in for Mikel Arteta in recent games due to the Spaniard's own injury, had a slight injury at the end of the game against Manchester City at the weekend, but should be available for selection when Arsenal travel to Villa Park on Saturday.\n\nIf Dortmund can isolate Mikel Arteta, they may have some joy on the counter attack.\n\nHe, Mertesacker and Koscielny will all know that there is no room for error with so little available back-up - an injury or a card for one of those three could spell all sorts of problems for Arsene Wenger's side.\n\nFlamini has not made the bench despite travelling.

The best bit.\n\nSo good luck to Bellerin.\n\nAmazing atmosphere here in Dortmund.\n\nSeems to get better each time.\n\nThe \"wall\" of yellow scarves and noise is fabulous.\n\n7:48 pm\n\nArsenal have conceded a couple of corners in the first minutes here and, as Szczesny said in yesterday's press conference, the Gunners have to improve their defending from set-pieces after conceding several goals from dead ball situations this year.\n\nDortmund are pressing Arsenal something fierce and have them penned deep in their own half at the minute, with a couple of Arsenal players caught out by the pace of their opponents already.\n\n7:50 pm\n\nOoh. Aubameyang found in the box with the cutback, but he's crowded out.\n\nArsenal can't get up to speed with the game yet, but they've found Danny Welbeck with a long pass there.\n\nHe'll be an important avenue out of defence for them tonight, you feel.\n\nNow they have a chance to take their first foray into the Dortmund half, but a slip from Arteta shows us just how quickly Dortmund can break...\n\n7:52 pm Yellow card: Mkhitaryan booked for Dortmund\n\nThat looked like it could have been a penalty as Arteta seemingly caught Mkhitaryan in the box.\n\nBut the reply shows he went to ground with no contact and he picks up the first booking of the game.\n\nEagle-eyed by the referee there!\n\nIt's Arsenal's turn to break, but Ozil fails to pick out a teammate and now Arsenal have it with Welbeck on the edge of the box but the move breaks down.\n\n7:53 pm John Cross\n\nDortmund lost many of their players.\n\nGoetze and Lewandowski both departed in recent times.\n\nNo Reus or Hummels tonight.\n\nJurgen Klopp remains and you feel he is such a big part of this team\n\n7:56 pm\n\nKoscielny with an important cut out there but Dortmund bring it forward again - they're right up for this game and Arsene Wenger will be keen for his players to take the sting out of these early exchanges.\n\nWith Ozil playing ahead of youngster Bellerin at the minute, it will be interesting to see if Dortmund target Arsenal's right side.\n\nThat's a poor ball by Mertesacker and Dortmund break again, with the German atoning by preventing Immobile from crossing - at the expense of a corner.\n\n7:59 pm\n\nDortmund are seeing plenty of the ball in the Arsenal half in the opening 15 minutes, with Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan getting involved in dangerous areas.\n\nBoth teams have so much pace now that you feel a goal on the break could just be what decides things, one way or another.\n\nGrosskreutz gets on the end of a lofted ball and breaks into the box, but Koscielny blocks the low cut back.\n\nFrom the corner, it falls to Papastathopoulos (hope he has a quiet game), who flashes a shot just wide.\n\n8:00 pm John Cross\n\nBellerin's pace is unbelievable.\n\nIt's like using the R1 button on your PlayStation controller to get him to sprint. Except that's him jogging.\n\n8:02 pm\n\nArsenal's defenders are feeling the pressure and rushing their clearances, as Immobile drags a shot from distance wide.\n\nThe Gunners defence, especially Koscielny, will need to find some composure if they are to build anything from the back.\n\nIf they're waiting for Dortmund to drop the pace, it might be a long wait...\n\n8:03 pm\n\nDortmund free-kick from deep and Szczesny punches it.\n\nKoscielny appears to handle the ball in the air as the ball comes back in, but he was fouled in before hand.\n\nIt looks like he raised his hand to protest the foul as he jumped for the hearder and the ball struck his hand.\n\nDangerous game to play...\n\n8:05 pm\n\nFirst Welbeck then Sanchez pick the ball up in dangerous areas, but the Chilean is just offside as the ball is played to him in the Dortmund box.\n\nMkhitaryan is down again and wants a free-kick. He'll have to be careful if he goes to ground too often.\n\nBy the way, Klopp is looking pretty cool on the touchline in a grey hoodie. Who says you have to wear a suit?\n\n8:05 pm John Cross\n\nRather happy Arsenal didn't sign Papastathopoulos (or Sokratis as we like to call him).\n\nTwice a season is enough when it comes to spelling out his name.\n\nHe's just stabbed wide from a corner. Decent chance.\n\n8:07 pm\n\nSanchez has it in the net, but it's offside and he is lucky not to pick up a booking - he played on after the whistle to take his shot.\n\nThat's something referees in Europe don't always like, as Arsenal fans know better than most.\n\nArteta with a clumsy challenge now and Dortmund have another chance to loft it into Arsenal's penalty area.\n\nImmobile unleashes another shot from some distance but it's high and wide of the mark.\n\n8:10 pm\n\nArsenal have it on the right and Bellerin shows some nice touches but Dortmund win the ball back and break - Mertesacker blocks the pass out to the left by Immobile - that would have been dangerous if he hadn't.\n\nWelbeck comes deep to get involved - Arsenal are struggling to keep the ball and don't really look comfortable yet with the way this game is unfolding.\n\nArteta looks to win the ball fairly from Mkhitaryan but this time the referee blows for a foul.\n\n8:13 pm Good chance for Dortmund!\n\nSchmelzer lofts in the ball from the resultant free-kick and Dortmund win a couple of headers in the Arsenal box, but Aubameyang is unable to really test Szczesny.\n\nThe Gabon forward plays a nice pass through to Immobile, but the Dortmund striker has just strayed offside.\n\nOhh, what a chance there!\n\nDortmund switch it to the left and the ball gets played to Aubameyang at the edge of the six-yard box.\n\nBut Szcezny stands large and gets a limb in front of the ball.\n\n8:15 pm\n\nHow are Dortmund not winning?\n\nImmobile chases down the long ball and plays a ball across the box, which Szczesny just gets a hand to.\n\nBut the ball breaks to Mkhitaryan who blasts over under some pressure from Wilshere.\n\nHe really should have buried that.\n\nArsenal are really struggling with Dotrmund's pace and movement right now...\n\n8:17 pm\n\nThis is a brief reprieve for Arsenal, who have the ball in the Dortmund half.\n\nGibbs plays a great ball across teh goal with Weidenfeller stranded, but it doesn't quite drop for Welbeck at teh back post and Dortmund scramble it clear.\n\nArsenal's best moment there...\n\n8:19 pm John Cross\n\nSanti Cazorla is warming up in front of the Arsenal fans.\n\nThey chant his name.\n\nHe's done more than Mesut Ozil has done in this game.\n\n#whereismesut?\n\n8:21 pm\n\nSanchez again loses the ball in a dangerous area and Dortmund can break, with Aubameyang unleashing a fierce shot that the Pole in Arsenal's goal is more than a match for.\n\nSzczesny is called into action again second later as Dortmund unleash another shot.\n\nHe's certainly been the busier of the two keepers by far.\n\nAnyone expecting a weakened Dortmund side tonight was wide of the mark.\n\nThe Germans have already fashioned 13 attempts, to Arsenal's zero...\n\n8:23 pm\n\nWilshere is fouled and Arsenal now have a free-kick in the Dortmund half.\n\nOzil stands over it and flashes in a ball that Sanchez is inches from getting onto the end of. But he's offside again...\n\nArteta doesn't look too happy with some of his side's attacking players, but they're beginning to get a bit more time on the ball as Ramsey plays it forward to Welbeck.\n\n8:25 pm\n\nSanchez loses it, but Jack Wilshere puts an early stop to the Dortmund counter and it falls back to the Chilean, who is fouled.\n\nThe Germans have had plenty of joy stopping Arsenal's danger man in the opening 40 minutes.\n\nJack Wilshere now concedes a free-kick chasing down a ball that has just bobbled away from him.\n\nIt's not clicking for Arsenal yet in the attacking half...\n\n8:28 pm\n\nImmobile within inches of playing in Aubameyang, but Koscielny steps out and makes a vital interception.\n\nAt the other end, Welbeck is played in by Ramsey, he drags his shot wide from the right side of the penalty area... he should have done better with that one, at least testing Weidenfeller.\n\nIt was a nice pass by Ramsey to unleash him though - Arsenal will want to get the Welshman on the ball much more in the second half.\n\n8:30 pm\n\nMkhitaryan unleashes a shot from just outside the Arsenal penalty area.\n\nIt's a daisy cutter but he again drags it wide.\n\nThe Gunners will certainly be concerned with the number of chances the Germans are making though - even if most of them haven't been on target as of yet.\n\n8:32 pm GOAL! Dortmund 1-0 Arsenal (Immobile)\n\nIt was only a matter of time until one stuck.\n\nDortmund play it out from the back and it lands at the feet of Immobile close to the half-way line.\n\nHe charges at the Arsenal back line and gets a bit of luck with the bobble of the ball, but finishes it cooly, slotting past Szczesny just before the half-time whistle.\n\nIt's no less than the Germans deserve after a cracking first 45 minutes by Klopps's men.\n\nAresnal will surely change things around for the second-half...\n\n8:35 pm Half-time: Dortmund 1-0 Arsenal\n\nSo Arsenal trail by a single goal at the break and they can probably count themselves lucky it's only one, given the frequency with which Dortmund tested Szczesny in that first half.\n\nDortmund managed 15 shots in that half to Arsenal's two. They only registered four on target, but the one that mattered was Immobile's 45th minute strike, which separates the teams.\n\nArsene Wenger will feel his defence should have dealt better with the Italian on the goal, but they've been run ragged by an impressive Borussia Dortmund who look keen to prove that they're not a diminished force this year.\n\n8:36 pm John Cross\n\nThere was nothing immobile about that goal.\n\nCiro Immobile ran from his own half, Gibbs and Koscielny stood off him and he fired a cross shot past Szczesny.Arsenal 1-0 down at half time.\n\n8:38 pm\n\nThe 'yellow wall' certainly made themselves heard in that first-half and they've had plenty to cheer.\n\nWatching the replays of that Dortmund goal, it came off an Arsenal attack deep in the Dortmund half, which won't please the manager.\n\nHe may not be a fan of the hairdryer, but I'm sure he's making his feelings clearly known in the dressing room.\n\n8:45 pm\n\nThe Arsenal defenders won't want to see that goal again - Gibbs and Koscielny are tracking Immobile, but are unable to stop the Italian's dash towards goal.\n\nArsene Wenger has a strong bench he can call on to change things around in the second half.\n\nIt's highly likely we'll see Santi Cazorla sooner rather than later, while Lukas Podolski, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Thomas Rosicky could all change things in attack for the Gunners.\n\nVery Mobile Immobile #Golazo! https://t.co/QhHNxQsA5Q via @vineapp -- Filippo Ricci (@filippomricci)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n8:49 pm Substitution:\n\nThere's a half-time change, but it's not for Arsenal.\n\nDortmund midfielder Sebastian Kehl makes way for new Dortmund player Matthias Ginter.\n\nAnd Arsenal are immediately on the back foot again with Aubameyang breaking, but Koscielny just about deals with it.\n\nAlexis Sanchez takes a speculative shot from distance.

Dortmund's defence just about deals with it.\n\n9:10 pm\n\nIn case you're wondering why the attendance is so low - Dortmund have an average home attendance of more than 80,000 - that's because it's reduced for Champions League games.\n\nStill, those in yellow and black have made themselves heard tonight.\n\nThe Arsenal fans in the corner haven't had much to cheer about.\n\nAs the pace of the game drops, Arsenal are getting a bit more time to kick the ball aroud, but are yet to do anything particularly dangerous with it.\n\n65,881 #attendancewatch -- John Cross (@johncrossmirror)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n9:12 pm\n\nIt's not quite Brangelina, but \"Cirobameyang\" sums this Dortmund side up nicely.\n\nThe two goalscorers could each have had a hat-trick, while Mkhitaryan has also put Szczesny through his paces tonight.\n\nBut it's Arsenal's turn to see what they can do with a freekick after a foul on Wilshere.\n\nIt's 30 metres out and Mertesacker is just unable to get on the end of Cazorla's lofted pass.\n\nCirobameyang! @ciroimmobile @Aubameyang7 #bvbafc 2-0 pic.twitter.com/ByvQjbf1GC -- Borussia Dortmund (@BVB)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n9:15 pm So close!\n\nMassive risk from Szczesny as he's closed down by two Dortmund players and is very nearly caught out.\n\nInstead, he plays it against Aubameyang and the ball rebounds for a goal kick.\n\nThat would have capped off a miserable night for Arsene Wenger.\n\nWilshere is looking to drive Arsenal forward but isn't getting much support and is closed down/fouled every time he picks up the ball.\n\nMkhitaryian is through after another mistake by Arsenal, with Arteta just letting the pass back run past him...\n\nBut the Armenian blazes over again.\n\nIf he could sort out his finishing, he would have had this game wrapped up five times over for Dortmund!\n\n9:17 pm\n\nDortmund are happy for Arsenal to have the ball in their own half, knowing they have a good chance of winning it back whenever they want.\n\nThe Gunners haven't got going all night, but here's Sanchez with a lofted ball wide for the Ox, but Welbeck is unable to connect with the cross.\n\nThat looks like another foul on Wilshere that's gone unanswered. Ginter took him out so he couldn't receive the return pass in a dangerous area.\n\nIt looks like that's been a deliberate ploy by the Germans.\n\n9:20 pm Substitution: Podolski on for Arsenal\n\nDanny Welbeck does the hard bit wonderfully, turning the Dortmund defender to give himself room for the shot, but he skies it. Needed a bit more composure there.\n\nNow Arteta makes way for Lukas Podolski, which could leave Arsenal's back-line even more exposed, if that's actually possible.\n\n9:22 pm Substitution: Jojic on for Dortmund\n\nIt's Dortmund's turn to make a change, with Milos Jojic coming on for Schmelzer, who's had a great game.\n\nAubameyang nearly gets onto the end of another ball over the top, but clatters into Szczesny as the goalkeeper heads it out for a throw.\n\nThe Dortmund man certainly felt that one but he looks ok to continue.\n\nThis is Dortmund. #bvbafc 2-0 pic.twitter.com/bUCCHiShnU -- Borussia Dortmund (@BVB)\n\nSeptember 16, 2014\n\n9:27 pm Substitution: Ramos on for Dortmund\n\nSanchez has another shot, but it's blocked and Dortmund come forward again.\n\nAgain Mkhitaryan fails to finish off a fine move after he drifts past the Arsenal defence by pretty much running in a straight line when Wilshere is caught dawdling on the ball.\n\nBut he just runs out of pitch as he's tracked down by the Ox.\n\nWilshere's stayed down and is receiving treatment and that's a worry.\n\nNow the final change for Dortmund as Immobile is replaced by Ramos, and the departing Italian gets a hell of a cheer.\n\n9:32 pm Yellow card: Jack Wilshere booked\n\nJack Wilshere goes into the book at the end of a frustrating night for the England midfielder, who will feel he didn't get much protection from the referee.\n\nHe's hobbling a bit since that last bout of treatment, but Arsenal don't have any changes left.\n\nArsenal are knocking it around in defence now, but Sanchez tries to give them some purpose moving forward, although Dortmund win it back.\n\nPodolski is nearly through and knocks it beyond Weidenfeller but can't keep the ball from running out.\n\n9:36 pm Full-time: Dortmund 2-0 Arsenal\n\nWe're into the last minute here and the Dortmund fans can be heard roaring loudly, but the action on the pitch is just about done.\n\nThere's the referee's whistle...\n\nWell that was poor from Arsenal who fall at the first hurdle in this year's group stage.\n\nArsene Wenger will want to forget that one and move on.\n\nThey'll need to play much better if they want to make it out of Group D...\n\n9:45 pm Well, that was disappointing for Gunners\n\nMikel Arteta is speaking following the game and says that Dortmund are the wrong team to go behind to.\n\nHe says that Arsenal struggled with the pressure that the Germans exerted, saying they were able to control the game.\n\nThe Spaniard says that Arsenal made some clear chances but have to now move on and get ready for Aston Villa at the weekend.\n\nHmmm, apparently Dortmund had 24 attempts to Arsenal's 4...\n\n9:52 pm\n\nPaul Merson says that Arsenal are a \"gillion\" miles away from competing for the top honours right now.\n\nIt's easy to over-react after a performance like that, but you can't really deny the fact that the Gunners are often badly exposed against the biggest opponents away from home.\n\nThey've been carrying several players for a while now and seem to lack leaders on the pitch.\n\nCan the likes of Mesut Ozil expect to maintain his place while he continues to struggle for form?\n\n9:56 pm\n\nFor Jurgen Klopp, that was understandably an enjoyable game.\n\nHe says the key is that his Dortmund team outran and outworked their counterparts all over the pitch, saying that you need to be brave against \"strong players\" like Arsenal have and take risks.\n\n\"I enjoyed this game from the first second to the last,\" he said.\n\nHe also gives a loud laugh when asked if this is the start of a new era for Dortmund, saying that the hard work never stops, but it's games like this that make it worthwhile.\n\nHe also did all that in English. Will he one day manage a Premier League team? Arsenal perhaps?\n\nAfter tonight, not many fans would say no to that!\n\n10:02 pm\n\nIn the other game from Group D tonight in case you're not feeling too dispondent, Galatasary needed a last-gasp equaliser to split the points with Anderlecht in Turkey.\n\nThat means that after the first round of games, Arsenal lie bottom of the group, while their next two opponents are tied on 1 point apiece and Dortmund are sitting pretty on 3 points.\n\nA draw in the other game is good for Arsenal, although the Germans will feel after tonight that the group is theirs to lose.\n\n10:06 pm\n\nAt least Lukas Podolski remembered that he has two roles at Arsenal - striker/winger and chief entertainer - and the moment before he came on when he appeared to have lost his shin pads was arguably a highlight for Arsenal.\n\nThe German needed to borrow Mesut Ozil's in the end, not that he got much use out of them.\n\nWhere do Arsenal go next? It's not the first time they've been forced to rally after being outplayed by top opposition, either in Europe or the Premier League.\n\nBut they certainly looked light in all those areas where fans were crying out for signings that never appeared tonight.\n\nDer Anfang eines gro\u00dfen Abends...

I work for my club, for my players, and for the club's supporters. I don't work for myself. It's not even something I think about a lot.''\n\nThe reality is different.\n\nOver the decade since he emerged into the consciousness of Premier League fans with that triumphant knee-slide at Old Trafford, the Champions League has been the Special One's competition.\n\nTwo wins, in 2004 and 2010, plus six other semi-final appearances - three with Chelsea, including last term, and three with Real Madrid.\n\nThere have been heartbreaks along the way, those penalty shoot-out exits against Liverpool and Bayern Munich, the 'ghost goal' at Anfield.\n\nNo wonder, when asked if he felt teased, tormented, by a \"cruel mistress'', there was a flicker of a smile - and then an implicit admission of the truth.\n\nMourinho said: \"The tournament is part of my history. And, even if sometimes they don't know it, I am part of the tournament's history.\n\n\"'It's simple. If I win it once more, to win with three clubs is unique. But even if I don't do it, how many top managers in the world have only one, or even not a single one?\n\n\"You have the example of the greatest in our country - meaning Sir Alex Ferguson - who won it twice. So, even if, from this moment, I don't win a single match in the Champions League, my history is there. I won it twice and that's fantastic, and something of which to be proud.\n\n\"Do I want to try to win it again? Of course I do. I have so many years ahead of me in terms of career.

Swiftly followed by that of Roberto Mancini.\n\nAnd as for Mourinho's other arch-nemesis, his immediate Chelsea predecessor Rafa Benitez, there's no doubting who was being denigrated as he added: \"At this moment, I'm only thinking about not playing in the Europa League.\n\n\"I want my club to succeed in the group stage. It would be very bad for the evolution of the group and the players, and for the club's prestige, to go into the Europa League.

They were taken apart by Bayern Munich on a September night three years ago, which ended with manager Roberto Mancini almost crying with rage in the Allianz Arena press room after Carlos Tevez had refused to take to the field for him. They were slaughtered for another 11 minutes of last December's Champions League tie, too, by a Bayern team made so complacent by the ease of their early 2-0 lead that they switched off and lost the game 3-2.\n\n\"Mistakes come... when you think everything's done,\" the Bayern coach, Pep Guardiola, told writer Marti Perarnau in the aftermath of last season's game, which features in the new chronicle of the season, Pep Confidential. City's comeback on that occasion also revealed a side which had moved on from the Mancini era; equipped with better players than Micah Richards and Gareth Barry, who had been so overrun two years earlier.\n\nYet the unvarnished truth, as they enter their fourth successive Champions League campaign tonight, is that City can no longer claim to be a side in evolution. Manuel Pellegrini has been equipped with a team for winning now. The average age of tonight's likely starting line-up is 28.7 years. The youngest player in the side will be 26-year-old Sergio Aguero if, as expected, the French central defender Eliaquim Mangala is not given a debut in such an inhospitable place.\n\nVincent Kompany said all the right things in his discussion of this Group E fixture: every trophy is our target; Even semi-final exits are for \"losers\"; the club expects us to win this. But there may be more consequences than disappointment for City's Abu Dhabi-based owners if they cannot end this journey in Berlin's Olympiastadion next 6 June - or at least travel a long way towards it. The enticements of Madrid, Paris and clubs beyond will become all the stronger to some of City's players if the side fall short once again.\n\nCity have assembled a collection of world-class players but still cannot claim they are a world-class side. Kompany is one of the most engaging and erudite footballers to sit in front of anywhere in European football but the answer to his claim that \"we are not favourites by any means for this competition\" was: why not?\n\nIt is no bad thing to be cast into the Allianz Arena as early as this. Guardiola's press conference was riddled with journalists' expressions of concern about new striker Robert Lewandowski's indifferent start - one domestic goal - and about Franck Rib\u00e9ry's absence. Behind Bayern's injury list - Holger Badstuber, Javi Martinez, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thiago Alcantara and Rafinha - lies the memory of the side's last European game here: the 4-0 semi-final defeat to Real Madrid in April.\n\nGuardiola felt he was corralled into gung-ho football against his instincts back then, and insists he will do it his way this time. The sublime start enjoyed here by Xabi Alonso - the embodiment of Guardiola's way - has only reinforced that belief. But it all adds up to a Bayern side feeling its way once again.\n\nThere are worries for City, too. The defeat to Stoke City last month was a major reverse: they have nearly always crushed that kind of opposition at home in recent years. But while Bayern's Philipp Lahm reflected on a World Cup hangover, City can rejoice in David Silva and Aguero. Both have begun the English domestic campaign as if they never went away to Brazil in the summer.\n\nThe decision not to have tested Mangala is curious. It again leaves Kompany alongside Martin Demichelis, who was jettisoned from Bayern in the reign of Louis van Gaal and whose error against Barcelona in February spelt the beginning of the end to City's last European campaign. Fernando, the other principal summer signing who has added immediate and immense balance, is injured.\n\nManuel Pellegrini\n\nTwo symmetrically imperfect sides then, with City knowing that a win at the outset could spare them the ordeal of more arduous opposition the other side of the group stage.\n\nKompany made the observation that winning the Champions League for the first time would be easier than breaking the hex to clinch City's first Premier League title in 2012. \"Before we won the league it was more difficult to believe we could do it than it is [now] with the Champions League,\" he said. \"My experience of the Champions League is that it's not more difficult to go to the end but everything has to be perfect. The Premier League is just a ferocious battle to the end. Eventually it will happen our way.\"\n\nA wise and calculated summer in the transfer market does makes this a better side than the one which fell to Barcelona. \"There is always a sign of us growing stronger,\" Kompany correctly concluded before taking his leave.

And thus made it their own.\n\nThe new two-tone kit for officials in the Champions League had a strange effect. In the opening minutes, Arsenal players seem to confuse the muggy grey of referee Olegario Benquerenca with their own dark blue shirts. The pale grey shorts and socks helped.", "Click here for your ultimate stats guide, including how Ciro Immobile's opening goal was all his own work\n\nRight here was the reason the Champions League seedings have to change.\n\nArsenal are about as close to being among the top eight teams in Europe as Borussia Dortmund's mighty and magnificent Westfalenstadion is to a wet Wednesday at Gresty Road.\n\nThey were outclassed in Germany, outplayed, torn apart, reduced to an imitation of a team that UEFA blithely placed in Pot 1when the draw was made earlier this month.\n\nArsenal are making the most of an impressive run of qualifications and the odd foray into the last eight, but it is hiding the current reality. Dortmund are a team permanently battling to keep their best players, and frequently losing the fight, yet they were on a different plane to the visitors. Quicker, sharper, more intelligent, their 2-0 win could have been doubled, or trebled, had they been surer in front of goal.\n\nAs it was, the second of the match scored by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after 48 minutes gave the scoreline the emphasis it deserved, and Arsenal may already have their sights on second place in Group D, at best. Galatasaray are the next opponents, at the Emirates Stadium, and a win is vital, if only to regain their confidence in European competition. This was a humbling night.\n\nAubameyang's goal summed it up. The ball from substitute Matthias Ginter caused unnecessary confusion in the Arsenal ranks, allowing Aubameyang to nip in, round Wojciech Szczesny and finish smartly as Laurent Koscielny collided with a post in a frantic attempt to block on the line.\n\nIt could have been worse. So much worse. Ciro Immobile, scorer of the first goal, nearly grabbed a second, forcing an outstanding one-handed save from Szczesny, Aubameyang had another shot his the bar, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan lashed one over when a cooler head would surely have netted a third.\n\nArsenal had the odd opportunity, too, but that in itself was worrying: the ball falling to Danny Welbeck on three occasions in good positions and each time the former Manchester United man found wanting.\n\nThe last time, everything about his play - the run, the control - was lovely, but the finish was that of a novice, panicked, and a long way over. Dortmund were equally wasteful, but the sheer volume of goalmouth opportunity ultimately paid off. Their first goal was already their 15th attempt of the game.\n\nSeptember is the time of the year that broadcasters roll out the new series; in the Champions League it is the time for repeats. The same old faces meeting in the same group stage match-ups. This was a rerun of Arsenal's meeting with Dortmund in group football last season; and in more ways than one for most of the opening 45 minutes.\n\nThe first-half followed an almost identical pattern to last year: Dortmund dominant, Arsenal toothless, yet somehow clinging on. This illusion of equality was dispelled with close to the final kick before half-time when Dortmund at last achieved what had eluded them here a year ago: and put the ball in Arsenal's net.\n\nIt was a soft goal that came from a bungled Arsenal throw-in. Possession was lost, the ball was cleared and Immobile picked it up inside his own half. Confounding those who mock his rather unfortunate surname, he began a run that took him through a very half-hearted Arsenal midfield and into the path of Koscielny.\n\nThe Arsenal centre half - outstanding here last season - put in a very lame challenge which Immobile shrugged off easily, before striking the ball across Szczesny in goal. It was no more than Dortmund deserved. They had been by far the better team until that point.\n\nJurgen Klopp, the Dortmund coach, continues to do an outstanding job in difficult circumstances. Their wonderful, boisterous ground, and reputation as a powerhouse of German football belies the fact they are very much in Bayern Munich's slip stream now. They lose their best players to the Bundesliga brand leaders, and to the wealthier Premier League clubs, too. Yet somehow Klopp soldiers on, producing teams capable of playing highly technical, exciting football, and at breakneck speed. If Dortmund could finish they would have slapped Arsenal halfway home with close to an hour to spare.\n\nAubameyang, born in France but an international for Gabon, was the main culprit, early on at least. Deployed in a wide starting position but with freedom to roam inside he got into several grand scoring positions but failed to take advantage.\n\nThe best of them came after 27 minutes when a lovely move switched the play from right to left, involving Erik Durm, Sebastian Kehl and Kevin Grosskreutz before finally finding its way back into the centre where Aubameyang was charging towards the target. He met the ball and shot first time, but straight at Szczesny from close range. Soon after, again picking up on a pass from Kehl, Aubameyang forced another good save from the Arsenal goalkeeper.\n\nHe was not alone in his frustration. In the 14th minute, a Durm cross fell to defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos who shot wide, and after a scramble and another good block by Szczesny in the 29th minute, Mkhitaryan wasted another good chance, blazing a shot over the bar.\n\nLast year, Arsenal scored the only goal of the game through Aaron Ramsey with their first shot on target after 63 minutes. They forced better openings on rare occasions here, but sadly lacked the clinical approach the Welshman brings. They had two chances in the first-half, both fell to Danny Welbeck, and he was not impressive.\n\nFor the first, after 31 minutes, a cross from Alexis Sanchez eluded Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, only for the ball to get trapped beneath Welbeck's feet at the far post. His second miss was more glaring. Put through by Ramsey, with only Weidenfeller to beat, his finish was snatched and wide. In his Manchester hotel room, Louis van Gaal - not shy to back his judgement in the worst of times - may be saying that he told us so.", "Real Madrid moved straight to the top of Group B with a win over woeful Basel and Cristiano Ronaldo moved to within three goals of Raul's all-time Champions League scoring record.\n\nThis was not Real Madrid rediscovering the swagger that saw them brush aside Bayern Munich in last season's semi-final and beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 in the final but they still had far too much for last season's Swiss Champions.\n\nThey took the lead as early as the 14th minute when right-back Nacho made his first run into the Basel area and played the ball to James whose clever backheel allowed the full-back to continue his run and shoot at Tomas Vaclik in the Basel goal.

Quicker, sharper, more intelligent, their 2-0 win could have been doubled, or trebled, had they been surer in front of goal.\n\nAs it was, the second of the match scored by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after 48 minutes gave the scoreline the emphasis it deserved, and Arsenal may already have their sights on second place in Group D, at best. Galatasaray are the next opponents, at the Emirates Stadium, and a win is vital, if only to regain their confidence in European competition. This was a humbling night.\n\nAubameyang's goal summed it up. The ball from substitute Matthias Ginter caused unnecessary confusion in the Arsenal ranks, allowing Aubameyang to nip in, round Wojciech Szczesny and finish smartly as Laurent Koscielny collided with a post in a frantic attempt to block on the line.\n\nIt could have been worse. So much worse. Ciro Immobile, scorer of the first goal, nearly grabbed a second, forcing an outstanding one-handed save from Szczesny, Aubameyang had another shot his the bar, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan lashed one over when a cooler head would surely have netted a third.\n\nArsenal had the odd opportunity, too, but that in itself was worrying: the ball falling to Danny Welbeck on three occasions in good positions and each time the former Manchester United man found wanting.\n\nThe last time, everything about his play - the run, the control - was lovely, but the finish was that of a novice, panicked, and a long way over. Dortmund were equally wasteful, but the sheer volume of goalmouth opportunity ultimately paid off. Their first goal was already their 15th attempt of the game.\n\nSeptember is the time of the year that broadcasters roll out the new series; in the Champions League it is the time for repeats. The same old faces meeting in the same group stage match-ups. This was a rerun of Arsenal's meeting with Dortmund in group football last season; and in more ways than one for most of the opening 45 minutes.\n\nThe first-half followed an almost identical pattern to last year: Dortmund dominant, Arsenal toothless, yet somehow clinging on. This illusion of equality was dispelled with close to the final kick before half-time when Dortmund at last achieved what had eluded them here a year ago: and put the ball in Arsenal's net.\n\nIt was a soft goal that came from a bungled Arsenal throw-in. Possession was lost, the ball was cleared and Immobile picked it up inside his own half. Confounding those who mock his rather unfortunate surname, he began a run that took him through a very half-hearted Arsenal midfield and into the path of Koscielny.\n\nThe Arsenal centre half - outstanding here last season - put in a very lame challenge which Immobile shrugged off easily, before striking the ball across Szczesny in goal. It was no more than Dortmund deserved. They had been by far the better team until that point.\n\nJurgen Klopp, the Dortmund coach, continues to do an outstanding job in difficult circumstances. Their wonderful, boisterous ground, and reputation as a powerhouse of German football belies the fact they are very much in Bayern Munich's slip stream now. They lose their best players to the Bundesliga brand leaders, and to the wealthier Premier League clubs, too. Yet somehow Klopp soldiers on, producing teams capable of playing highly technical, exciting football, and at breakneck speed. If Dortmund could finish they would have slapped Arsenal halfway home with close to an hour to spare.\n\nAubameyang, born in France but an international for Gabon, was the main culprit, early on at least. Deployed in a wide starting position but with freedom to roam inside he got into several grand scoring positions but failed to take advantage.\n\nThe best of them came after 27 minutes when a lovely move switched the play from right to left, involving Erik Durm, Sebastian Kehl and Kevin Grosskreutz before finally finding its way back into the centre where Aubameyang was charging towards the target. He met the ball and shot first time, but straight at Szczesny from close range. Soon after, again picking up on a pass from Kehl, Aubameyang forced another good save from the Arsenal goalkeeper.\n\nHe was not alone in his frustration. In the 14th minute, a Durm cross fell to defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos who shot wide, and after a scramble and another good block by Szczesny in the 29th minute, Mkhitaryan wasted another good chance, blazing a shot over the bar.\n\nLast year, Arsenal scored the only goal of the game through Aaron Ramsey with their first shot on target after 63 minutes. They forced better openings on rare occasions here, but sadly lacked the clinical approach the Welshman brings. They had two chances in the first-half, both fell to Danny Welbeck, and he was not impressive.\n\nFor the first, after 31 minutes, a cross from Alexis Sanchez eluded Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, only for the ball to get trapped beneath Welbeck's feet at the far post. His second miss was more glaring. Put through by Ramsey, with only Weidenfeller to beat, his finish was snatched and wide. In his Manchester hotel room, Louis van Gaal - not shy to back his judgement in the worst of times - may be saying that he told us so.", "City were pipped to second place in their group by Bayern last year and their captain knows they must avoid a repeat\n\n* City beaten by Bayern at the Etihad\n\nThe mission for Manchester City in Bavaria on Wednesday eveningis to prove their Champions League lesson has been learned. With Manuel Pellegrini hoping for a \"mature\" campaign from his team, \"avoid defeat\" may be the manager's final words before facing a Bayern Munich side who overran City at the Etihad Stadium last season.\n\nThe match ended in a 3-1 defeat - a lesson handed out by Pep Guardiola's side - and, despite winning the reverse fixture 3-2, the group ended with both teams tied on 16 points, with Bayern top on head-to-head results.\n\nCity progressed to the last 16 for the first time but were drawn against Barcelona and knocked out. As City prepared to face Bayern at the Allianz Arena for a third time in four seasons, Vincent Kompany reiterated the need to end as stage winners.\n\n\"We know how much damage it can cause your hopes if you don't win the group,\" the City captain said. \"We always face difficult teams if we are not seeded but we were very close last year.\"\n\nTo win a group that includes CSKA Moscow and Roma, as well as the champions of 2013, who will send out Philipp Lahm, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, Manuel Neuer, Mario G\u00f6tze and Thomas M\u00fcller from Germany's triumphant World Cup side - Bastian Schweinsteiger is injured - remains a tough task.\n\nYet this is what City must achieve to ensure the best hope of progressing to the competition's business end. Pellegrini's team are battle hardened and vastly experienced. The likely starting XI will have no player under 25 and includes the star names of Yaya Tour\u00e9, Kompany, David Silva, Samir Nasri, Edin Dzeko, Joe Hart and Sergio Ag\u00fcero.\n\nYet when put to Kompany that anything less than reaching the semi-finals would constitute failure, he said: \"I always say the same: 'There is always one winner.' All the rest are losers.\n\n\"Anything but first place is the same for me. You start a season at Manchester City nowadays and it's not acceptable not to put all the trophies on your ambitions list.\n\n\"It's a case of me and all the players looking at all the trophies and thinking: 'We have to go until the very end of the season.' I mean the club is asking us to win now, so that's one thing. In which order you can't say.\n\n\"We have won so far - in the last four years we have been successful but you always want to take it a step further. Let's take it in context: we are not favourites by any means for this competition but we would like to compete and challenge.\"\n\nKompany did let slip his belief City will soon add the European Cup to their recent success. \"Before we won the league it was more difficult to believe we could do it than with the Champions League. My experience of the Champions League is that it's not more difficult to go to the end but everything has to be perfect.\n\n\"The Premier League is just a ferocious battle to the end. Eventually it will happen our way,\" he said.\n\nLast year's defeat by Bayern featured an exhibition of pass-and-move that engulfed a City defence who had Micah Richards at right-back, with Martin Demichelis partnering Joleon Lescott. The victory in Munich had Kompany and Matija Nastasic as the central pairing.\n\nKompany-Demichelis, now the first-choice axis in central defence, was not available to Pellegrini a year ago but they are expected to line up on Wednesday when Pablo Zabaleta is suspended.\n\nYet this time Pellegrini can call Bacary Sagna at right-back - rather than Richards - into a rearguard that will expect another busy evening. Of the 10 highest passers in the defeat at the Etihad only Tour\u00e9 made the list for the English champions - in last position, with 43 completed.\n\nIt may be easy for Pellegrini to order his players to stop Bayern retaining the ball, far harder to execute at the Allianz Arena, but this is what the manager will ask. There is some hope, though, in Guardiola's depleted ranks.\n\nToni Kroos, last season's prompter-in-chief, who made 76 successful passes at the Etihad, now plays for Real Madrid. From the rest who featured, Rafinha (84 passes), Franck Rib\u00e9ry (80), and Schweinsteiger (73) are all ruled out because of injury, while Arjen Robben (56) is a doubt. Yet a side containing Neuer, Lahm, M\u00fcller and G\u00f6tze still expect victory. As Boateng, the former Manchester City defender, said: \"We want to win as it sets you up well for the group.\"\n\nFor Kompany Bayern remain the benchmark despite their 4-0 capitulation to Real Madrid in this stadium in the second leg of last season's semi-final. \"Every single time you come here is an opportunity to prove yourself. We now take it as a challenge against one of the top three clubs in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Bayern Munich is one of the hardest places to come to. It's time to start making these games close and making up the gap between ourselves and the other top clubs.\"", "Jose Mourinho insists his Chelsea side must do \"everything\" they can to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League and avoid the chance of dropping down into the Europa League.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Chelsea's opening Group G match against Schalke 04 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, the Chelsea manager said it would be detrimental to his players' development should the team have to compete in the second-tier competition.\n\nTeams finishing third in the Champions League group stage go into the Europa League, joining the competition in the knockout phase.\n\nMourinho is bidding to become the first manager to win the Champions League with three different clubs but he is only concentrating on the six group games to ensure his team finish in the top two and progress to the round of 16.\n\n\"The competition is part of my history and I'm part of the tournament's history. To win with three clubs would be unique,\" Mourinho, who won the competition when in charge at Porto and Inter Milan, told a news conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Do I want to try to win again? Of course I want to. I have many years ahead of me. But in this moment I only think: don't play Europa League.\n\n\"It would be very bad for the evolution of our players to go to Europa League. We have to qualify. We have to do everything to qualify.\"\n\nChelsea have started the season in emphatic fashion, winning their opening four league games with a mixture of power and panache.\n\nIn stark contrast Schalke have endured a winless start in the Bundesliga, languishing near the foot of the table having taken just one point from their first three matches.\n\nMourinho, however, said league form will not matter and Chelsea will be wary of their opponents despite beating them 3-0 home and away at the same stage of the competition last season.\n\n\"They drew against Bayern Munich, obviously they lost their last match 4-1 but I don't see that as a drama or having a consequence in the Champions League,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"I don't see a relation between the fact they lost the last match. Probably it will make them stronger. Probably they can discuss the mistakes they made, they can try to have a different approach to be a better team and a difficult opponent.\n\n\"In this moment it is a short competition of four teams for us, six matches. Everything is different,\" he said of the group which also contains Slovenian champions NK Maribor and Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon.\n\nMourinho will have a full-strength squad to pick from because striker Didier Drogba has recovered from the ankle injury which forced him to miss Saturday's 4-2 win over Swansea City in the Premier League.", "Bayern Munich will be without experienced Franck Ribery when they meet Manchester City in their Champions League Group E opener on Wednesday with fellow winger Arjen Robben also doubtful, coach Pep Guardiola said.\n\nFrenchman Ribery made his Bundsliga season debut on Saturday following weeks out with a knee injury, making a short appearance as a substitute and scoring in a 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart.\n\n\"He is not here, he is at home,\" the Spanish coach told reporters on Tuesday when asked about Ribery's condition. \"He went to the doctor on Monday and today they told me he cannot play.\"\n\nDutchman Robben is also nursing a knee injury and sat out the game against Stuttgart.\n\n\"Arjen is here for training.

Asked about that defeat, Guardiola said: \"The 3-2 defeat? We also won 3-1. We have learned how good teams are. We have learned a lot. That if not everyone defends we have big problems and they have so much quality that means we have to run a lot.\n\n\"Fernandinho, Silva, Nasri, Ag\u00fcero, Dzeko, Demichelis, all these players are absolutely great, extraordinary, and we have to be in the position to dominate the game. If we don't have the ball then we have to run, run, run. The first game is important but it's a tough group. We want the three points but now is not the time to think about the opponents and what's going to go on in the group. We have to think about our style and how we are going to bear them.\"\n\nWith Roma and CSKA Moscow the other clubs in Group E, Pellegrini - who serves the first game of a two-match ban at the Allianz Arena after criticising the referee in the last-16 defeat to Barcelona in February - knows his team must get off to a good start .\n\nOf Robben and Ribery, Guardiola said: \"Arjen is here. Franck is [out]. Robben could play. It's his first training. We're going to try it. Ribery - definitely not, he's at home. The physio told me after that Franck has to go to the doctors and today told me he can't play, that's all.\"\n\nBayern's captain, Philipp Lahm, made light of the injury list. \"It's been difficult as people came late after the World Cup,\" he said. \"We have had injured players. It's not the best but we have to accept the challenge. We are at home. We are not afraid and are not concerned. I think we are going to win.\"\n\nGuardiola claimed no Bayern player wants to join Manchester United, moreover, with the club reportedly interested in Thomas Muller, Schweinsteiger, Robben and Toni Kroos during the summer.\n\nWhen it was put to Guardiola that he may have had to say \"no\" more than once to Louis van Gaal, the United manager, who is understood to have also wanted Kroos, Guardiola claimed none of the squad was interested in moving and United do not have the funds to buy them.\n\n\"They didn't have enough money.

The margins are very small.\"\n\nCity head into the clash knowing that their last visit, in December last year, saw them field a weakened side and yet still come from two goals down to beat a strong Bayern side.\n\nThat victory ultimately meant nothing in terms of the Champions League, as City could not bag the extra goal that would have displaced the Germans from top spot in the group and they went out to Barcelona in the last 16.\n\nBut Kompany feels it had a profound effect on the Blues' season - straight after it, they blitzed Arsenal 6-3 and went on a run of eight straight Premier League wins and a run to the Capital One Cup final.\n\nAnd, after having a ropey away record at the start of the season, they did not lose another domestic game on their travels until the unlucky loss at Anfield in April.\n\n\"I actually reckon it meant a lot,\" said Kompany. \"We were just one goal away from topping the group. It was an important game to win, it give us more belief. \"You have to remember that at the time we were not really performing well away from home. We went from struggling away from home to being the best club away from the Etihad all season.\"\n\nIn terms of their line-up, City will miss Fernando, who was key to the plan of Manuel Pellegrini - who himself is banned from the touchline after his comments about referee Jonas Eriksson last season.\n\nBut they are likely to stick by the five-man midfield that helped them reverse their 3-1 loss at the Etihad Stadium season.\n\nKompany hinted as much, saying: \"Our system has changed since two years ago, when we played Bayern.\n\n\"It was not clear how we wanted to play because everything was new for us then but we saw that we were better and worked better in the second game.\n\n\"We hope to play in a positive way and get the points, but it's going to be difficult.\"\n\nBayern coach Pep Guardiola had earlier talked City up as one of the potential winners of the Champions League, but then damned them with faint praise by declaring they were one of eight to 10 teams who could lift the trophy in Berlin on June 6.\n\nThat brought a chuckle from Kompany. \"He's taking a massive risk isn't he!\" said the skipper.\n\n\"We know how much damage it can cause your hopes if you don't win the group. We always face difficult teams if we are not seeded but we were very close last year. We are very excited but we believe in our ability as well.\"\n\nAfter two visits in three seasons, Kompany says going to Bayern no longer holds any surprises.\n\n\"It's a place we've become familiar with,\" he said. \"Every single time you come here is an opportunity to prove yourself.\"", "Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola believes the absence of Manchester United from this season's Champions League serves as a warning to all 'big' clubs.\n\nUnited are sitting out the elite competition for the first time since 1995 after a dismal last season in which they finished seventh in the Barclays Premier League and failed to qualify for Europe altogether.\n\nBayern are another of the Champions League's mainstays.

For shame.\n\n6.30pm BST18:30\n\nPreamble\n\nSo, what to make of Arsenal? Well, they've shown their grit by coming through a difficult qualifier against Besiktas. The last-minute winner against Crystal Palace on the opening day of the season also suggested that steel is running through this side. So did the fightback from 2-0 down against Everton and from a goal down against Manchester City. Maybe we've got a new Arsenal on our hands, an Arsenal that won't lie down and crumble at the first sign of trouble, an Arsenal with resilience and heart, an Arsenal that can handle the pressure of playing big matches, an Arsenal that has grown from past failures. Jack Wilshere is finding his form and they've splashed the cash on Alexis Sanchez, a player who can be placed in the top bracket, and spent \u00a316m on Danny Welbeck, England's new hero.\n\nOn the other hand, it could be said that they were fortunate to escape unscathed against Besiktas. That they weren't especially convincing against managerless Palace. That the only reason they had to come from behind against Everton was because they messed up the first half. That they couldn't hold on against City. That Welbeck's chip against the champions shows why Manchester United were willing to sell him to direct rivals. And that Arsene Wenger's decision to sign neither a commanding midfielder nor another centre-back proves that not every lesson from the past has been taken on board. Nothing like a good healthy debate about everyone's favourite activity, football!\n\nWhen it comes to assessing Arsenal, it seems that there always has to be a caveat. They are an excellent side. But are they a great side? They play fantastic football. But at the highest level, is it winning football? They won the FA Cup. But can they win the league or the Champions League? It could be that we are going round in circles. The temptation is to say no to all those questions; forget the FA Cup, they will prove nothing until they prove something, nothing will change until something has changed. In that sense, it is a little unfair to be critical at this stage. After all, they have a fine squad with some of the best players in Europe. They are in the Champions League every season and they won a trophy last year. In fact, they have already won a trophy this season, beating City in the Community Shield.\n\nCan they take the next step, though? Can they? Can they take the next step? If you put a gun to my head - and I don't know why you would, I'm a nice enough chap, but let's run with this - I would have to say, no, Arsenal won't win the league, Arsenal won't win the Champions League - they're undoubtedly improving and maturing in all areas, but there was naivety in the way they tried to defend their lead against City on Saturday, they haven't upgraded on Mikel Arteta or Mathieu Flamini and now they have a defensive shortage because of an injury crisis that everyone saw coming once it became apparent that Wenger didn't want to sign an additional centre-back this summer. With Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal injured and Calum Chambers struggling with tonsillitis, Arsenal are in Germany with only three senior centre-backs and word is that the Spanish youngster, Hector Bellerin, will start at right-back. Maybe it will all work out and Bellerin will be fine. But without the benefit of hindsight, this feels like an oversight.\n\nThat said, Arsenal should not be overawed about facing Borussia Dortmund tonight. It's an intimidating ground, the Westfalenstadion, but Arsenal have a better recent record there than most, denied victory in the last minute in 2011 and inspired by a Ramsey goal last year. And although there is worry over Arsenal's injuries, spare a thought for Dortmund. As if seeing Robert Lewandowski follow Mario Gotze to Bayern Munich wasn't enough, poor old Jurgen Klopp has to contend with injuries to Mats Hummels, Ilkay Gundogan, Jakub Blaszczykowski, Nuri Sahin and Marco Reus. Another test of Arsenal's credentials, then, and plenty will be read into it whatever the outcome, but it's one that they might just pass with flying colours.\n\nKick-off: 7.45pm.", "Pep Guardiola claimed today that he had approaches from Manchester United for several of his Bayern Munich players this summer.\n\nYet the Bayern coach said the Barclays Premier League club would not have been able to afford them even if they had not rejected the chance of moves to Old Trafford.\n\nGuardiola appeared to confirm that United enquired about signing Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas M\u00fcller, nodding as their names were put to him during the press conference ahead of the German club's Champions League group E tie against Manchester City at the Allianz Arena tomorrow night.

A week later police arrested him and found the valuable artwork under his bed.\n\nHe was jailed for nearly 14 years for the Tissot snatch and grab, with more jail time added on for separate thefts of various motorbikes.\n\nHe was released on parole in March last year. Less than two months later the 63-year- old was back in jail due to the disappearance of yet another motorbike, this one a $130,000 Ducati. The Parole Board recalled him to jail also to complete his sentence for the Tissot theft.\n\nRomanov used the ancient right of a habeas corpus writ (the right to demand to have a court decide whether he was being held legally) to challenge the Parole Board decision and try to get himself out of jail. His bid was rejected by the High Court at Auckland in March.\n\nHowever, Romanov was back in the High Court at Auckland before Justice Geoffrey Venning this morning to appeal the Parole Board's decision to recall him to prison.\n\nIn the past, Romanov has resorted to other means to spring himself from prison. In February 2006, as an inmate at Rangipo Prison, he ran off on his first day of work at a prison farm.\n\nAfter four weeks on the run, the Armed Offenders Squad surrounded a house in Pukekohe. Several firearms were found and Romanov, who is bald, was found wearing a wig that was described as looking \"like a cat without any legs\".\n\nDetective Senior Sergeant Neil Grimstone said at the time that the wig was the same one that Romanov wore a week earlier when he took a BMW for a test drive but failed to return it.\n\nThe subsequent convictions saw another three years heaped on to his original sentence and Romanov was back behind bars - all up, his jail time was now to be 19 years.\n\nThe profusion of sentences he faced then caused confusion at the courts - Romanov appealed the sentence handed down for his escape and a High Court judge set all the sentences aside and imposed a new one. But in doing so he seemed to make a mistake, misreading the length of one of the earlier sentences.\n\nThat set the ground for Romanov to argue his current recall by the Parole Board was technically illegal because the shorter sentence meant he was no longer subject to Parole Board oversight.\n\nToday Romanov's lawyer Quentin Duff said the career criminal had effectively served his sentence and the Parole Board did not have jurisdiction to haul him back behind bars.\n\nDuff said Romanov said \"at what stage am I allowed the comfort of finality?\".\n\nMeanwhile, crown prosecutor Briar Charmley said the Parole Board did act within its jurisdiction when recalling Romanov.\n\nRomanov was subject to recall as his statutory release date had not yet passed, Charmley.\n\nThe prisoner's statutory release date did not roll around until next year so while Romanov was able to be released on parole he could be recalled to prison until the date of his statutory release date had passed, according to the Parole Act 2002, she said.\n\nCharmley said Romanov posed a risk to public safety and had a propensity to commit property theft.", "The Kia K900 has all the refinement and features found in cars with a longer pedigree in the luxury space but this car offers it at a discount...\n\nDiffering definitions of luxury in the automotive market are truly reflected in the eyes of the beholder.\n\nTo one person it might be having all the refinements and gadgets available in a modern car accompanied with a smooth and quiet ride. To another buyer it might just be about the name on the front of the car, letting all to see it that the owner has \"made it\" establishing a certain status in society. For many it's a combination of both.\n\nEnter the new Kia K900 luxury sedan from Kia. It has all the refinement and features found in cars with a longer pedigree in the luxury space but this car offers it at a discount. Then the name on the car comes into play. Is the Kia K900 a car anyone aspires to own? Well, after a weeklong trip with my family I'm more impressed with Kia than I have been before but the realist in me knows Kia isn't a luxury brand, at least not yet.\n\nLooks\n\nThe K900 is an unfortunate name, it begs the question is this a dog? No, it is a full-size car about the same size as a 7-series from BMW or S-Class from Mercedes Benz. The K900 is based on the same platform as the Hyundai Equus but differs in price and content. For a full-sized car with limo-like dimensions, the K900 starts at a remarkable $49,995 for the V6 model and $60,995 for the V6 premium model. The top V8 model is $69,995. The styling is strong, especially the top V8 model seen here with LED headlamps and taillights and very North American looking chrome multi-spoke wheels. The rear doors are huge and Kia has done but good job of keeping the proportions of the car in check while grafting Kia's signature Tiger Nose grille. The rear bumper and lower air diffuser looks especially chunky, almost mimicking the Lexus LS and its integrated exhaust tips.\n\nInside\n\nEvery person that sat in the K900 was blown away with the refinement, fit and finish and especially the materials used. The V8 test model had leather covering the front of the dash and piano finish on the wood trim accented. Add in tasteful chrome and aluminum, dark, rich wood on the steering wheel and centre console and the K900 looks like a million bucks. The front and rear seats came with ventilation and V8 models have a rear seat reclining feature. Despite spending countless hours behind the wheel travelling with two children in the back, the car offered a very relaxing ride for the passengers, and the kids especially liked the cooled seats on a very hot day. The centre infotainment screen is controlled with a rotary dial in-between the front passengers and is very similar to Audi's MMI system.\n\nDrive\n\nThe V6 model comes with the very competent 3.8L engine that puts out 311hp. having tried this in other Hyundai/Kia products and it is smooth and powerful. The V8 is superb, with 420hp coming from a 5.0L V8, there is no lack of power. The shift in the auto industry is to smaller engines that utilize turbo charging but Kia is sticking with good old engine displacement to get the job done. Covering more than 1,000km, the real world fuel economy was 12L/100km on the highway. To say that the K900 is smooth and quite is an understatement, I would put this car up against the new S-Class from Mercedes and a blindfolded passenger would have a hard time distinguishing the difference. What does become apparent is the K900's lack of steering feedback to the driver and cornering ability. On Highway 3 from Hope towards Penticton the K900 wallowed in the switchback corners, it really didn't like it at all. Driving back on the Coquihalla was a different story; the K900 shines in open road cruising, making it a wonderful long road trip companion.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe K900 is Kia's very first pure luxury car and they got a lot right. The interior is as good as anyone in the marketplace and Kia does it at a substantial discount to the competition and power isn't a problem especially with the big V8 available. But there were a few problems. The automatic lock and unlock feature on the outside doors only unlocked. This is probably a quick fix but an issue and the Bluetooth audio didn't work either. Another stumbling block is the lack of all wheel drive (AWD). In this segment almost all vehicles sold come with AWD, in fact most companies only offer it. The market for this car is a happy existing Kia owner wanting to upgrade to something more and that is where the V6 model comes into play. Kia might not sell many of these cars but they have it for sale to show anyone that is interested that they can make a true luxury car, maybe not in name but in features and refinement.", "BEIJING/NAGOYA Japan (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is reconsidering a move to open a new compact car assembly plant in Mexico after company President Akio Toyoda told planners searching for a site to pause and review its rationale, executives familiar with the matter said.\n\nAccording to four Toyota and group executives, momentum had been building for a decision this summer on the expansion, with the aim of starting production of the mass market Corolla in Mexico in a few years. But Toyoda then asked the team to \"re-review\" the project by year?s end, the people said.\n\n\"There?s absolutely no unused capacity lying around anywhere in North America?

Recalls of Takata airbags have been happening off and on for years. Last April, 3.6 million Hondas, BMWs, Nissans and other cars were recalled globally over the problem; about 6.5 million cars were recalled in the five years prior.\n\nThe problem has been getting more and more attention lately, thanks in part to aNew York Times investigation last week that revealed how Takata and Honda deemed the problem \"an anomaly\" and didn't start recalling cars until 2008 despite being aware of problems for years before that. (Sound familiar?)\n\nWhat cars are affected? A lot of cars. Curiously, it's been hard to locate a centralized list of all vehicles equipped with the potentially faulty airbags. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Safer Car website has a list of some, and this database from International Business Times (which was current as of August) has more.\n\nIn general, some of the cars affected include mid-2000s BMW 3-Series models; some mid-2000s Ford Mustangs and Rangers; mid-2000s Subaru Bajas, Legacies and Imprezas; early 2000s Toyota Tundras, Corollas and Sequoias; early 2000s Nissan Maximas, Sentras and Pathfinders, as well as various Infinitis; early 2000s Mazda6s and RX-8s; and nearly every model Honda and Acura made in the 2000s, including Accords, Civics, CR-Vs, and MDXs.\n\nHonda is Takata's biggest customer, and they have been far and away the most impacted by this recall. The airbag detonations are ongoing, with one happening as recently as June.\n\nIf you think your car might be involved, go here to check your VIN.\n\nWhat's the problem with the airbags, exactly? It has to do with the explosive devices in the metal airbag inflater. In the faulty airbags, those devices can burn more aggressively than they should, causing the inflater to burst and sending pieces of metal flying through the airbag fabric. This could potentially maim or kill the car's occupant.\n\nHas anyone been injured or killed? Yes, they have. The Times report says that based on complaints sent to regulators, 139 injuries have occurred as a result of the airbag explosions, and at least two people were killed in Hondas alone after shrapnel tore through their bodies following an airbag deployment.\n\nOne was 18-year-old Ashley Parham, who in 2009 bumped another car in a parking lot in her 2001 Accord, which caused the airbag to unnecessarily deploy and fire shrapnel into her neck. She bled to death, investigators say. The other was 33-year-old Gurjit Rathore, whose 2001 Accord hit a mail truck six months after Parham's death, causing a similar airbag detonation with shrapnel. Rathore bled to death in front of her children.\n\nWhy are the Takata airbags the ones with this problem? The airbags in question were developed in the late 1990s in an attempt to reduce the toxic fumes that plagued early airbags. But as Reuters reported back in January, Takata had some quality issues with them early on:\n\nTakata has acknowledged to U.S. safety regulators that it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of the explosive propellants used to inflate airbags. It also has conceded to Reuters that, in at least one case, it kept inadequate quality-control records, which meant that hundreds of thousands of cars had to be recalled to find what might have been only a small number of faulty airbags, a decade after they were made.\n\nTakata has said they have now resolved these quality issues.\n\nDoesn't geography have something to do with the defect? At the moment, the recalls are mostly isolated to certain geographic areas -- NHTSA calls it \"limited regional actions\" for vehicles in Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\nTakata says they have been studying whether vehicles in especially humid areas are more at risk. However, as Forbes reported, shrapnel deployments have also occurred in places like Oklahoma and Los Angeles. Honda has since expanded their recall to more regions.\n\nHow long have Takata and the automakers known about this? The first reported airbag shrapnel deployment happened in 2004. Honda settled several injury claims in court but did not issue a recall until 2008, and then only for about 4,000 Civics and Accords. They did tell Takata of their airbag problems in 2007.\n\nHonda has expanded their recall continuously since then, including a recall of nearly 440,000 cars in 2010 -- but without acknowledging previous deaths or injuries. BMW pressed Takata in 2010 on why their airbags supposedly weren't affected as the supplier claimed, only for Takata to backtrack and say BMW's airbags were at risk.\n\nClearly, this a problem known for years, but Takata and Honda's reluctance to make it public probably delayed other automakers from issuing their own recalls.\n\nWhere was NHTSA in all this? Great question! Where was America's auto safety regulator when all this was going on? As with the GM recall crisis, they say they kind of knew about it, but not enough to order the automakers to do a full recall. They are investigating now whether Honda should have acted sooner, something that could result in fines or other penalties.\n\nAgain from the Times:\n\nBy law, automakers are required to inform federal regulators of a defect within five business days, even if an exact cause cannot be determined. Honda filed a standard report on the initial air bag injury in 2004, and followed up with similar filings on the incidents in 2007. The form requires automakers to list the component -- in this case, an air bag -- that was responsible for an injury, but it does not allow for elaboration about the circumstances, like a rupture.\n\nIn none of those four instances of ruptured air bags, The Times found, did Honda go beyond the standard form and separately alert safety regulators to the most critical detail: that the air bags posed an explosion risk.\n\nNor did federal regulators inquire about the incidents when the forms were filed by Honda.\n\nI bet they're wishing they had now, though.\n\nWhy isn't everyone pissed off like they were at GM? I'm really not sure. This recall is almost five times larger than GM's ignition switch recall. Maybe it's because the blame can't be pinned on a single automaker, or maybe it's because it doesn't affect car companies we've come to expect this from. It's a serious safety issue, but it hasn't gained a ton of traction in news coverage, though that could change.\n\nWhat could happen to Takata here? They've taken some big hits from this and will continue to do so, but experts doubt it will put them out of business. Bloomberg reported last month that Takata projects a $235 million loss as a result of the recalls, and they have replaced president Shigehisa Takada, the grandson of the company's founder, with a Swiss national named Stefan Stocker. Takada remains CEO and chairman.\n\nWhat should I do if I think my car is affected? As with other recalls, this is done by registrations and VIN numbers. You should get a notice in the mail if your car is one of the vehicles affected by the recall. Once that happens, you should get the vehicle serviced at a dealer, which happens free of charge.\n\nDo you have any of the vehicles included in this recall, and if so, have you gotten a notice yet?", "Billy Horschel was second in strokes gained/putting in the FedEx Cup playoffs.\n\nBilly Horschel is one of the game's best iron players, but his putting was the most important key to his remarkable season-ending stretch that netted him more than $11.4 million in one day.\n\nIn April, Horschel ditched his PING Redwood Piper S model and added a PING Karsten TR B60 in the bag instead.

Do you see any areas of overlap or connection?\n\nThomas Keller: I think that both of us are deeply rooted in tradition, but at the same time [are] forward thinking and on a constant quest for evolution. That's the important thing. There are other things - integrity and quality. But it's in the classic quest for evolution: what is going to make something better, what is the best.\n\nWhat attracted you to the i8?\n\nI've always had a strong bond with BMW. My first car was a BMW and I still have it today, so I've had it for decades before this. It's a 320i, and I bought it when they launched that, when they went from the 2002 to the 320 - the beginning of the 3 Series. I actually still have every BMW I've ever bought. It's hard for me to let them go. I have a 5 Series Gran Turismo as well, and the i8 represents a total departure from just two years ago in terms of design and features. It represents evolution, and creativity.\n\nHow and where do you plan to use the i8? As your daily commuting vehicle? As a weekend car?\n\nI'll use it as much as I can.

Watch for Mayor Ed Murray to send legislation to the city council that expands car sharing. (Car sharing is different than the ride-sharing model offered by companies such as Uber where entrepreneurial drivers hawk themselves as chauffeurs on a network. In the car-sharing model, customers plug into a network of cars and drive themselves.)\n\nCurrently, there is one car-sharing service in Seattle, Daimler AG's Car2Go, which, per a city limit, has a 500-car network service. Murray's proposal will expand car sharing in two ways.\n\nFirst, he wants to open up Seattle to more car-sharing companies such as BMW's DriveNow. Fizz hears the legislation will allow three additional companies into the market.\n\nAnd second, he wants to empower the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) director to make the call (rather than the council) on the cap per company. The city caps the number of cars a company adds to the market because car-sharing companies, by paying the city, allow their members to park in street parking slots all over town -- taking up valuable parking spots. SDOT will be tasked with monitoring the data on parking availability to figure out how high or low the cap on each car-sharing company should be.\n\nSDOT will be tasked with monitoring the data on parking availability to figure out how high or low the cap on each car-sharing company should be.\n\n2. Another piece of legislation that's in the pipeline? A new affordable housing fund based on the idea of a \"Linkage Fee.\"\n\nRick Jacobus, the consultant who initially presented the new policy idea to the city council's land use committee in late July, has also presented data showing that one of the city's current affordable housing programs -- the \"Incentive Zoning\" program -- was falling short on both of its goals. The incentive zoning program makes developers pay extra if they want to build beyond height limits in specific development zones such as South Lake Union. (The money went into an affordable housing fund.) It was supposed to be a win/win for the city: more housing and more money for affordable housing. However, Jacobus showed that developers weren't using the program and so housing and affordable housing cash was being left on the table. (Jacobus reported that 62 percent of eligible developments since 2001 did not use the building incentive, creating just 616 units of affordable housing over the past 13 years and leaving about $50 million MIA in affordable housing and daycare funding.)\n\nThe linkage fee would be a mandatory fee for all development in urban growth districts all over the city, not just in specific zones where developers were given an opportunity to build higher.\n\n\"Universalizing\" the affordable housing fee in all development zones (not single-family housing zones, though) will bring in more money for affordable housing while simultaneously incentivize more building because, conceivably, the fee should be lower with more developers participating.\n\nSeattle City Council member Mike O'Brien, chair of the land use committee, will hold a meeting on the new Linkage Fee proposal this Tuesday.\n\n3.

It's also well within budget so you can de-mod and re-mod to your heart's content.\n\nIt's a VR-6 modified to hell and back again for $7K (I'll bet you could get drive off for $5500 cash though).. and it's got a roof-mounted wing so you know it means business.. (or the owner like to tow kite surfers or something)..\n\nHere's how to do a Honda Civic right: Take a body that weighs nothing, de-clutter the engine bay, and add a huge turbo and you have something that will eat Corvettes for breakfast and poop out MPGs before its next serving. This example is one of the best I've seen in a LONG while.\n\nThis one is such a mystery that not even the seller knows what's really under the hood. Here's an excerpt from the auction description:\n\nEngine: A bit of a mystery. I traded a good car for the engine. All I know is that it's very high compression late B20.. '74 I think, very nicely ported and polished head, my best guess (based on measuring lift) is that its got a R-grind cam. Double valve springs, steel timing gears. I added the Weber DCOE 40s, though it'd probably prefer 45s. The head is shaved.. er.. maybe chopped, significantly. As in, I've never seen so much meat removed from a B20 head. Low elevation might be a problem. I don't know. It runs great here, but we're at 5000-8000 feet. Definitely overbored to 2.1 or more. Might be stroked. I don't know.\n\nAnd since the car is deeply below budget, there are a few choice modifications one reader would apply:\n\nThink of it as a bizarro-world Shelby Cobra, but instead of having a Ford Powerplant in an AC body, it's Chevy powerplant in an equally unreliable British car. Same thing, really. It has all the right go-fast bits, with just enough cuteness to get cops looking the other way while you light up the bias-ply rear tires.\n\nThis thing is so damn cool that it's a wonder it hasn't been sold yet. It's a BMW vintage race car that obviously needs some work (zip ties and duct tape), but for a little over $5000, it's worth the investment, if only to have as a driveway ornament. It has an in-cabin brake bias valve. NOT EVEN A MAYBACH HAS THAT!\n\nBut beware: If you do get this car running, it may attract any local roaming Bill Caswells, and it's mating season around this time.\n\nHere's what you're looking at. A Ford Model T body on a custom frame, with Chevy 4.3L carb'd V6, with twin turbochargers and some of the most massive rear wheels ever made by humans>. All for under $10 grand. Plus it looks a little like the car from the Munsters (a timely reference, I'm sure). It also weighs 1400 lbs and puts out 400 hp, which is about the same power to weight that you get with a freaking Bugatti Veyron.\n\nThis one's not even on eBay, but I gave it a pass because holy crap, JDM. I can't imagine getting body panels would be easy to come by, but it's worth it with its uniqueness alone.\n\n(suggested by In a Mini; let them mock me as My Mini Countryman is higher than you)\n\nThis one was a bit of a foregone conclusion. It's a car that's the base for everything from kit cars to homemade turbo projects. It's the American's answer to the Toyota MR2 that was always better when tinkered with, and this car, with its 400 cubic inch V8, in \"restored show condition\" is about as good as they get. It's not my taste at all, but that's the point with modified cars - they're deeply personal and reflect a sense of individuality above all else. I'm sure this would make a cool cruiser or burnout machine for anyone with a few bucks to spend on a unique car.\n\n(Suggested by My X-type is too a real Jaguar)\n\nIf you want more great eBay performance values, check these out: http://carbuying.jalopnik.com/the-ten-best-s...http://carbuying.jalopnik.com/the-ten-best-s...\n\nTavarish is the founder of APiDA Online and writes about buying and selling cool cars on the internet.

Ask leaders how they come up with their groundbreaking ideas and you'll hear everything from \"in the shower\" or \"at the gym\" to \"looking totally outside of our industry\" and \"getting out of the office and meeting someone new.\" The common thread is that inspiration strikes people in different ways at different, and often unexpected, times.\n\nAs the CEO of an innovation-training firm, futurethink, I've worked with thousands of business leaders, and I can unequivocally say that it's possible to unleash creativity with purpose -- and without constraints -- in an office context.\n\nCompanies like BMW, Kraft, P&G, Airbnb, and Novartis frequently go beyond standard brainstorming sessions and use a range of techniques to develop new ideas. These innovative companies take a methodical yet varied set of approaches to ideation, which can be categorized in the following five ways:\n\n* Forward thinking\n\n* Incremental thinking\n\n* Customer-centric thinking\n\n* Disruptive thinking\n\n* Collaborative thinking\n\nConsider these five approaches and the corresponding 15 tactics below to get better ideas in your innovation pipeline.\n\nForward thinking enables you to forecast the future, anticipate opportunities, and leverage tomorrow's trends.\n\n1. Follow fringe blogs. Tap into the opinions of underground communities before their viewpoints enter the mainstream. Use blogsearch.google.com to identify blogs relevant to your industry and organization, and utilize their RSS function so you receive blog updates right to your inbox.\n\n2. Hire a tech scout. BMW has recruited idea scouts from Silicon Valley, Japan, and Europe to report on new research and trends from their respective markets. Scouts use an intranet database to distribute findings to all BMW managers, which drives innovative thinking. If your organization has the budget, hiring a scout to identify emerging trends will help propel your brand into the future and stay ahead of the competition.\n\n3. Define a \"Top 10 Trends\" list. Examine the fundamental driving forces that will likely affect your organization in the following STEEP categories: social, technological, economic, environmental, and political. Distribute this annual list to key individuals in your organization, and generate forward-thinking strategies based on it.\n\nIncremental thinking keeps complacency at bay with ongoing improvements to even your most successful solutions.\n\n4. Map out your purchase experience. Go undercover as a consumer of your own product or service and experience the customer's purchase process firsthand. What were the shortcomings? Which steps could be streamlined or removed? What can you improve to exceed customer expectations?\n\n5. Audit your competition and identify improvements. Interact with your competitors via in-store and online channels. Get on their mailing lists and call their customer service line. Buy their products -- and experience their return process. Where are their strengths and weaknesses? What can your organization do better?\n\n6. Crowdsource. Open innovation platforms provide an effective means for collaborating with customers and potential partners on products and services. Kraft's Collaboration Kitchen uses the NineSigma platform to enable external submissions of ideas for improving the Kraft experience and its products. If NineSigma isn't feasible for your business right now, tap into your customer's opinions through an idea-submission or feedback-gathering campaign on social media.\n\nCustomer-centric thinking involves paying close attention to what your customers say (and don't say) in order to generate ideas that will delight them -- and keep you ahead of the competition.\n\n7. Assemble a network of early adopters. Identify a loyal group of customers to jointly collaborate on the design and function of your products/services. Because early adopters tend to share insights that are rarely gleaned from traditional focus groups, this tactic can reduce development costs and shrink feedback loops.\n\n8. Spend a day (or seven days) with your customers. P&G is heavily entrenched in the growing area of ethnographic research. Ethnographic studies observe customers and users in their natural environments with the goal of uncovering new product ideas or enhancements. The popular Swiffer line, for instance, is the direct result of P&G researchers studying cleaning staff in Southern California. In this region, professional cleaners would attach paper towels to sponge mops in order to dust floors and other surfaces. In your own business, identify a few select customers and arrange for your managers to shadow them for a week. Note consumer habits, frustrations, and creative repurposing of your and the competition's products. Use this research as the basis for highly focused idea-generation sessions.\n\n9. Interview frontline employees. The people who know your customers best are those who spend the most time with them. Arrange for managers to meet with sales people, customer service representatives and retailers. Ask them to find out what they believe customers desperately want -- and gather internal teams to ideate how to make it happen.\n\nDisruptive thinking is about identifying your industry's sacred paradigms and conventions -- and shattering them.\n\n10. Study the smallest firms in your industry. Rule-breakers tend to be the more nimble upstarts. Analyze your smallest and hungriest competitors to generate ideas for how your organization can regain the relentless energy and work ethic of a new company.\n\n11. Host an \"impossible to possible\" session. Airbnb is a home-sharing marketplace that has disrupted the traditional hotel industry. By enabling individuals to rent unoccupied living space to guests, the company has altered the perception that hotel rooms are travelers' sole option for accommodations. In your own company, ask teams to complete these sentences:\n\n* Our customers would never say X about our industry.\n\n* We would never sell our product/service in X way.\n\n* You'll never see us change X.\n\n* Customers would never pay for X.\n\n* Our customers would never do X.\n\nAs a group, generate ideas to address each convention. What can you do to reverse each belief? How can you transform each impossibility into a possibility?\n\n12. Hold an \"against the grain\" event. Outsiders are more adept at identifying rules to break than insiders are. Hold a one-day, no-holds barred session for nontraditional invitees, such as people who've never bought your offerings; your newest hires; and experts in other industries. Ask for ideas that go completely against the grain -- you never know which insights will lead to groundbreakers.\n\nCollaborative thinking achieves innovation through external partnerships and open collaborations.\n\n13. Identify new partnership ideas by looking at your existing value chain. Suppliers, vendors, distributors, packaging, and customers are all valuable sources of ideas and collaborative partnerships. Review your value chain and decide which firms represent high-potential partnership opportunities.\n\n14. Transform your industry by partnering with the competition. As part of the Diabetes Genetic Initiative, for example, pharmaceutical giant Novartis decided to offer its clinical data to researchers around the globe -- free of charge. The company's unprecedented move was premised on the idea that more minds working on the same problem could produce faster and better solutions. After decades of fruitless work, this program began to produce breakthrough results in just three years. In your own business, identify opportunities that could truly transform your industry. Reach out to competitors to see how you can both benefit through collaboration.\n\n15. Create a \"lazy IP\" list and invite collaborators to bring it to life. Do you own intellectual property that has never been commercialized? Take it to the outside. With the blessing of your legal/compliance teams, invite external parties -- perhaps by announcing the campaign online to cast a wide net -- to review the IP list and find ways to mutually benefit from it.\n\nInnovation is certainly about great ideas. It's also about the capability to continuously generate great ideas -- and compelling people to look around, think, and connect. Once you've baked this capability into your organization's DNA, you'll find that responding to customer needs, outpacing competitors, and introducing groundbreaking innovation becomes an organic part of how you do business.", "The motto of This Year's dmexco -- \"Entering New Dimensions\" -- Is a Good Description of the Event Itself; That Could Already Be Felt on the Very First Day of dmexco 2014; The Sixth dmexco Clearly Entered New Dimensions, Thanks to a Record-Setting Number of 807 Exhibitors From All Over the World, a New Benchmark of 710,000 Square Feet of Exhibition Area in Three Completely Filled Halls, and more Than 470 Top-Class Speakers at an International Level; The Biggest and Highest-Caliber Exposition of the Global Digital Economy, Which Will Be Open for One More Day, Stands at the Center of a New Digital Economy That Is Becoming Increasingly Relevant to All Areas of Marketing, the Media, and Consumer Communication -- in Short, the \"Digiconomy\"\n\nCologne, Germany, September 15, 2014 /India PRwire/ -- The rapid digitization of the entire world we live in is increasingly changing economic structures and laws. The rules for doing successful business are no longer the same ones we knew in the past. The age of a new digital economy -- the \"digiconomy\" -- has begun. That was evident on the very first day of dmexco 2014 throughout the exposition grounds and at the high-powered conference. This year's dmexco, whose motto is \"Entering New Dimensions,\" is already expecting to post a record number of visitors. With its 807 exhibitors and more than 470 top-class speakers from all over the world, Cologne's summit meeting of the global digital elite is the central hub of the digiconomy. This is where the decision-makers from the areas of marketing, the media and advertising can directly enter these new dimensions. The potential for doing successful digital business has never been greater. In Germany alone, the volume of digital display advertising is expected to reach EUR 1.41 billion in 2014. This figure was presented by the Circle of Online Marketers (OVK) of the German Association for the Digital Economy (BVDW) in the new OVK Online Report 2014/2, which was presented for the first time at dmexco. According to the latest forecast, the German market for digital display advertising has grown by 6.8 percent in 2014 by comparison to the previous year. \"In the first half of 2014 there was a certain restraint in the market for traditional display advertising. However, we are already seeing a clear increase in demand during the second half of the year. As a result, we won't quite reach the level of growth we originally expected, but we will have a satisfactory market result, especially by comparison with the other media,\" said OVK Chairman Paul Mudter. The OVK Online Report 2014/2 can now be downloaded free of charge at www.bvdw.org.\n\nToday all of the important brands and the leading companies of the global digiconomy will be presenting their latest digital solutions, technologies, visions, and innovations on 710,000 square feet of exhibition area in three completely filled halls at dmexco. The companies include Adobe, Amazon, Baidu, eBay, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Twitter, Yahoo!, and Yandex. At 30 percent, the proportion of exhibitors from outside Germany is higher than ever before. The U.S. and the UK are represented especially strongly this year. France's digital economy has its own national pavilion for the first time this year, and Switzerland and Austria have further expanded their presence. Other important exhibitors from India, Japan, Malaysia, Uruguay, the United Arab Emirates, China, Russia, and Canada have also recognized the significance of dmexco as one of the few globally relevant digital events with a genuine business background, and are now exhibiting in Cologne.\n\nOn the redesigned and expanded stages of the dmexco Conference 2014, top representatives of the global digital economy are discussing the most intelligent strategies companies can use to meet the challenges of a new digiconomy. In a program encompassing more than 200 hours, dmexco visitors are receiving the world's broadest overview of current trends, growth strategies, product innovations, and creative variety from the digital environment of marketing and advertising. In addition to top-class discussion rounds and strategic and visionary keynote speakers, dmexco 2014 is also offering a number of innovative formats such as showrooms and spotlight interviews that focus on themes including Visions, Creativity, the Internet of Everything, Native, Mobile, Data, and Commerce.\n\nThe speakers at the dmexco Conference 2014 represent the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me -- the most important thinkers and top brands of the digital economy. This year there are even more high-caliber representatives of the worldwide advertising industry, including Pieter Nota (Philips), Bonin Bough (Mondelez), Anke Sch\u00e4ferkordt (RTL Group), Kirk Perry (Google), Tom Buday (Nestl\u00e9), Martin Riley (Pernod Ricard and President of WFA), Carolyn Everson (Facebook), Steven Althaus (BMW Group), Brad Rencher (Adobe), Ajaz Ahmed (AKQA), Caroline Taylor (IBM), Blasco de Felice (L\u00b4Or\u00e9al), Michael I. Roth (IPG), Jerry Buhlmann (Dentsu Aegis Network), Anna Bager (IAB), Rishad Tobaccowala (Vivaki), Jonah Peretti (Buzzfeed), and Rob Norman (GroupM). Further highlights of today's dmexco Conference included the upgraded concept of the dmexco World of Experience, in which the digital future of tomorrow can already be experienced today, and the inspiring stage program of the new dmexco Start-Up Village, where promising young entrepreneurs present their ideas.\n\n\"In the past years dmexco has managed to position itself as the largest international online marketing fair where all the major players from around the world meet,\" says Bernard Lukey (Yandex) concerning the successful development of the event. David Shing (AOL) believes that the event's success is due in particular to this year's motto, \"Entering New Dimensions\", and to the intense focus on the new digiconomy. \"It's no longer about digital marketing, it's about marketing in the digital world. The dynamics have completely changed,\" he says. Sean Lyons (Havas Worldwide) is already sure, even after the first day of the event, that dmexco as the summit meeting of the digiconomy will set the standards in the future. \"dmexco is the digital benchmark,\" says Lyons to sum up the event's international standing.\n\nChristian Muche, dmexco Director Business Development, Strategy & International, and Frank Schneider, dmexco Director Marketing, Sales & Operations: \"dmexco 2014 represents all the dimensions of the current and future digital economy, and thus it stands at the center of a new digiconomy. We regard dmexco as a leading international trade fair and conference, and we actively implement this claim. Our goal is to serve as central brokers of information and networking and to ideally support companies and our partners as they enter new dimensions and successfully launch themselves in the new digiconomy. The first day of dmexco is the best proof of the absolute top level we have successfully achieved this year.\"\n\nYou can find all of the facts and figures about dmexco 2014 at http://dmexco.de/Downloads/Facts-Figures-e.pdf.\n\ndmexco is the leading international expo and conference for the digital economy.

As the central hub for all thought leaders from digital brands, advertisers, and marketers, all types of agencies, and media owners, dmexco is connecting the global digital economy.", "Portside - When the financial crisis of 2008 sent U.S. automakers to the precipice of failure, conservatives, notably Mitt Romney, urged the Obama administration to let the car companies go bankrupt. Neoconservatives blamed \"high wages\" paid to unionized autoworkers for the inability of GM, Ford, and Chrysler to compete. In his book The Crash of 2016, author Thom Hartmann points out a flaw in the argument that high wages to American workers are the problem. He says:\n\nThomas Hartmann - Actually, Germany paid their autoworkers about $67 an hour (including wages and benefits). But the United States paid its average worker only $33 an hour (also including wages and benefits). On top of that, German car manufacturers were highly profitable, despite the comparatively large paychecks of their workers. BMW earned a before-tax profit of 3.8 billion euros, and Mercedes-Benz hauled in profits of 4.6 billion euros.\n\nSo how did Germany just completely blow up the myth that car companies have to pay their workers less to be more profitable and manufacture more cars? How can Germany do the opposite: pay their workers more, be more profitable, and make more cars?\n\nThe answer: democracy.\n\nFirst, Germans have completely democratized the auto plant by unionizing nearly every single autoworker in the country -- under IG Metall, the German autoworkers union. With such a high union membership rate, autoworkers hold a lot of sway when they threaten to go on strike. That's how workers have been able to keep wages high and working conditions satisfactory. But as Horst Mund, the head of the International Department of the German autoworkers union, pointed out, unions hardly ever go on strike in Germany \"because there is an elaborate system of conflict resolution that regularly is used to come to the sort of compromise that is acceptable to all parties.\"\n\nOne reason for the more collaborative relationship between CEOs and workers is that, unlike in the United States, unions aren't under attack and there aren't any \"right to work for less\" zones in Germany to which car manufacturers can flee so they can ignore the voice of organized labor.\n\nAnother and perhaps more powerful reason is that there is a constitutional amendment in Germany that forces corporate executives to listen to labor unions. The Works Constitution Act requires every factory to set up a works council that gives representatives of the workers a seat at the table in every decision-making process at the factory. That is the democratization of capitalism, expanding the decision-making process to not just the corporate elite but the entirety of the company, from the bottom up.\n\nThis, according to Mund, is the real reason why the autoworkers union has a loud voice in the German economy. Pointing to the adversarial relationship between employers and labor unions in America, Mund says, \"The accusation that American unions are more radical and destructive ... definitely has to do with the hostile environment in which the unions have to act. How can they be constructive and friendly if their asses are kicked all the time?\" He goes on to say that without the Works Constitution Act in Germany, \"employers would not talk to us either if they had the choice.\"", "A $40 million renovation project approved in April by residents of the Mirasol community has come under attack by an opposition group that demands a new vote, alleging the project will cost more and provide less than promised.\n\nIn a letter to the Mirasol Club & Association board, attorney Alfred A. LaSorte Jr. of the West Palm Beach office of Shutts & Bowen, says that information the board distributed prior to the vote failed to highlight interest payments that raise the cost by $7.7 million dollars. After the vote the board decided to reduce the scope of the project, meaning that residents will pay more than expected and receive less.\n\n\"This is analogous to an authorization to pay up to $50,000 for a specific automobile, for example, a BMW 535i,\" LaSorte wrote. \"Such authorization would not permit the Board to spend that same sum of money for a less valuable Honda instead.\"\n\nLaSorte said his firm has been retained by \"a significant number of Club members\" to address concerns over the project vote and the board's alleged refusal to comply with records requests.\n\nThe board was scheduled to meet with its lawyer on the matter Monday, Mirasol General Manager Matt Lambert said.", "British media is reporting MINI is planning a production version of the Rocketman concept but not before 2016.\n\nWith each new generation, the MINI departed from the meaning of its moniker and now it has reached a point where the BMW-owned company actually wants a smaller model. However, this is where the problems begin as the UKL platform isn't suitable for such a small car so MINI has to resort to collaborating with another manufacturer willing to lend a smaller chassis.\n\nThe Rocketman concept shown two years ago received positive feedback and now MINI's head of design says the company is still interested in a city car but \"won't reveal anything more [to the world] until [a viable design] is ready.\" However, he did hint a production Rocketman is still being considered and work is being made for an entry-level model.\n\nSince BMW has teamed up with Toyota for several projects, it is believed MINI's small car will be based on the Toyota iQ, with an estimated starting price of \u00a311,500 ($18,700 or \u20ac14,500) and a launch date no sooner than 2016.", "Another season of graduation has come to pass. Sights of fresh graduates flinging their square caps always harks me back to my time at college, which is strange since my college did not hold a convocation ceremony for us. Though I am sure, it must be extremely gratifying going through the ritual.\n\nIt has been two years since I did my majors in computer science. The four years I spent at college have been the four most fulfilling years of my life. My past self might argue that my time at school was possibly the halcyon period of my life, but the sheer joy in discovering oneself and learning to make more sense of the world around you, mostly through friends and often through failure, simply makes my days at college peerless. It's funny because I distinctly remember longing for school for at least a month into my course.\n\nEasing myself out from the confines my graduate school was an exercise in letting go. Suddenly, there were no classes to look forward to, and my days seemed longer than usual. On one hand, people scrubbed the town in search of a decent job, and on the other, pictures of mates getting married started popping up on social networks like unwelcome guests.\n\nThings had changed. Change is uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's a big bad world out there,\" a portly professor would often drawl in one of his lectures. \"Jobs are scarce and employers are bootstrapped\" had became a platitude towards the end of our course. But going to college often exerts a reassuring influence on you -- a touch of invincibility, an abundance of pride and apparent knowledge that a glorious career awaits us.\n\nThis influence can be insidious.\n\nTo all heads, which caps have ever been flung off of, and to graduates who didn't get the occasion to, here is sage advice to find your feet when the bubble of college bursts. You won't hear the pop sound. Act. Now.\n\n1. Do not go looking for money.\n\nI repeat: Do not go looking for money. Instead, look for work which empowers you with skills to help you learn and grow. Accepting a job solely due to the remuneration is is like pretending to water a plant by spraying water over its leaves; it looks shiny and attractive, but the plant eventually crumples and wilts since little attention was paid to nourishing its roots.\n\nMoney, in this case a fat pay packet, often warps perspective and leads people astray. It is especially hazardous when it's tethered to a position considered prestigious in a milieu that respects convention and sneers at failure. The concept of owning boastful wealth is a treacherous mirage created by the society and people around us. Of course money is important, but I doubt if anyone goes to their grave lamenting that they couldn't buy a Rolls Royce.\n\n2. Do what you love.\n\nI'm sure you've heard this before. Yet only a few manage to wrap their head around this adage. Taking up work that you enjoy doing, and making a career out of it is probably the easiest way to lead truly rewarding lives. Imagine being given the opportunity to pursue a childhood hobby like origami or painting or any other activity through your entire life. If your heart is in the right place, you could grow up to be an world-class architect or an artist. The penthouse and a BMW will follow suit.\n\nWhen you work on something you enjoy doing, you add immense value to this world and make yourself valuable in return. An artist adds value by regaling people through various forms of art. An entrepreneur adds value by solving large-scale problems and creating jobs. A sportsperson creates value by enthralling his/her fans and making nations proud.\n\nSome people like Sachin Tendulkar find their passion at an early age while others like John Grisham take a while longer, which is totally alright. The important thing here is to keep looking and not settling for a life which seems insipid.\n\nLike Steve Jobs intoned, \"You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.\"\n\nWhat makes your heart sing? If all jobs paid the same what would you be doing? Look at the man in the mirror and ask him these questions; and when the man has spoken, renounce everything to follow his calling.\n\n3. Believe in yourself.\n\nHaving full, unimpeachable faith in oneself is the best defense against a world saturated with naysayers. Remember that doubt has killed more dreams than failure ever will.\n\nBelieve that you are meant for the big stage, that you're destined for greatness, that you can improve lives and make the world a better place.\n\nNever compare yourself with anyone. Every successful person was once an ordinary face in the crowd, grappling with the ladder to success. He too had the same doubts as you, and possessed very limited access to some resources that you take for granted; but he ploughed on; irrepressible faith in himself and and a healthy disregard for the doubting Thomas. It doesn't matter if people did not take him or his idea seriously; the failure forged a smarter version of him.\n\nMistakes are good. Taking a wrong turn allows you to backtrack and sear the incorrect road into memory, never to be taken again. Sometimes the journey of a single step starts with a thousand miles in the opposite direction. Next time, our headstrong friend goes back to present an idea to someone, he will no longer be the callow bloke who was whisked away, but a hard-boiled egg which is tougher to crack than all those coming fresh out of the farm.\n\n4. Invest in yourself.\n\nYou are the best project you will ever work on. Try to learn something new everyday. Go to bed smarter than when you woke up.\n\nWork. Work while others play so that you can play while others work.\n\nBelieve in the power of preparation. There's no glory in practice, but without practice there is no glory. Unyielding grit has the power to move mountains and change destinies. Renaissance artist Michelangelo said \"If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful at all\"\n\nRead. It will help you like nothing ever has. A good book will give you sanctuary whenever you find yourself doused in drudgery. To reap the true joy of reading however, you would need to make time for reading - it should not be something you do in your free time, but something which has its place in your daily schedule.\n\nStart a blog. Write. Put pen to paper. Vent your innermost thoughts. Bare your soul and write a journal or just shake the dust off the poet which had become dormant under the weight of textbooks. You don't have to write the next best-seller but make sure you are the author of your destiny.\n\n\"I start early, and I stay late, day after day, year after year, it took me 17 years and 114 days to become an overnight success.\" -- Lionel Messi\n\nMudit is a geeky engineer, a sly analyst and a snarky writer.

A similar technology has been used in South Korea for trams and buses since 2010.\n\nWhile IndyCar's only true green initiative is using methanol fuel, Formula One moved to a \"power unit\" in 2014 that has a 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 engine and energy recovery system combination.\n\n\"The world changes and you just have to keep up with it,\" said McLaren driver Jenson Button, which will have Honda joining as its engine supplier in 2015.\n\n\"I don't think any manufacturers would come into the sport with a V8 or V10 engine because there aren't many road cars with them.\"\n\nThe inaugural Formula E race was won by Lucas di Grassi. The next ePrix is Nov. 22 in Putrajaya, Malaysia.\n\nBy the Numbers: If Formula One's governing F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) changes the rules surrounding the superlicence required to race in that series, it might as well be called the \"Max Verstappen Rule.\"\n\nBuried at the end of the FIA World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) press release last week that unveiled the 20-race 2014 F1 schedule as well as the calendars for several other series was a short statement concerning the way the licences are awarded.\n\n\"A mandate has been given to the FIA Administration to review the qualification and conditions for the issuing of a super licence, in consultation with all parties concerned. A proposal will be put forward for WMSC approval in December for implementation in 2016.\"\n\nVerstappen qualified for a superlicence after a test with Toro Rosso last week in Italy where he completed the required 300 kilometres in an F1 car. The 16-year-old Dutch driver, who has already been confirmed as a driver for Toro Rosso for 2015, races in the European Formula 3 Championship, which is easily four or five steps down the ladder from F1. With six races to go, he is second overall in the F3 point standings with eight wins in 27 starts.\n\nAlthough he will be 17 by the time the 2015 season comes around, Verstappen will break the existing record for the youngest F1 starter by two years. This has many in the paddock questioning the wisdom of system that allows a kid with little experience in cars to qualify to race at the pinnacle of motorsport.\n\nThe last driver to enter F1 with limited experience in cars was 2007 world champion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, who won 13 of 23 starts and two titles in British Formula Renault before signing with Sauber for 2001.\n\nRandom Thoughts: There were a couple of Canadian championships handed out on the weekend, with Tristan DeGrand taking the Toyo Tires F1600 overall title in style by winning the season finale at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park on Sunday.\n\nThe penultimate F1600 round on Saturday saw Ottawa's Zach Robichon make a dramatic last corner pass on DeGrand to take the win by a scant 0.001 seconds and postpone the title celebration by 24 hours.\n\nThe F1600 B Series crown for drivers in cars built before 1994 went to Connor Wagland on Saturday after his main challenger for the title, Amy Castell, crashed in the first corner. His fifth place result was enough to take the title.\n\nCastell's bad luck continued in Sunday's race where mechanical troubles ruined her second consecutive day and saw her slip from second to third overall in the final B standings behind Mike Lee.\n\nAcross the Atlantic in Germany, BMW driver Marco Wittmann's sixth place finish in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters race at the Lausitzring was enough to seal the 2014 championship with two rounds to go. It was BMW's second title in the three years since returning to DTM competition in 2012.\n\nCanadian Robert Wickens saw a podium finish slip through his fingers when he was given a drive thru penalty for ignoring a yellow flag, but he fought back to finish fifth. He started 12th on the grid in his Mercedes. The other Canadian in the field, Bruno Spengler, had a day to forget after a first lap incident with another car delivered a penalty and also caused his car to lack speed. He ended the day 15th.\n\nTechnically Speaking: There's been lots of talk this year in Formula One about the sport developing technology and innovation that's more relevant to road cars.\n\nWhile it's important for manufacturers to ensure that the millions of dollars that goes into F1 research and development connects to the automobiles it puts on the street, sometimes the road car division plays a key role on the grand prix side of the garage.\n\nA case in point is the cooling system used on the all-conquering Mercedes grand prix racer this year, which proved to be a huge headache for the F1 engineers until they spoke to the road car guys.\n\n\"We didn't understand the problem, and we got the guys back in Stuttgart involved in the R&D centre in Sindelfingen and they had an instant solution,\" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.\n\n\"They knew the problem from the road car side and the exchange was quite interesting to see because they solved our problem, but equally they also found our cooling technology so interesting that they want to implement it in the next generation S-Class.\"\n\nThe F1 operation also had some reliability problems with the turbocharger that was solved by a quick e-mail exchange with the engineers at the Mercedes factory at Stuttgart.\n\nQuote of the Week: \"I mean that's just silly ... he just drove at him - not good. Sometimes you are being passed and you've got to accept it. You do your best not to be passed but what can you do? I was worried about Heidfeld there.\"\n\n- Three-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti's view after Formula E driver Nicholas Prost veered into Nick Heidfeld who had pulled alongside for a last lap pass in the final corner of the race in Beijing on Saturday. Heidfeld's car went sideways and then got airborne after hitting a curb. He flew into a barrier and rolled once before his car came to rest upside down, but walked away unhurt.\n\nThe Last Word: Formula One's ban on all radio communication designed to help drivers during races goes into effect in Singapore this weekend, and it should be interesting.\n\nThe sport decided last week that it would only allow messages related to pitstop strategy and safety issues in an effort to lessen the feeling among fans that the drivers are getting too much help from their engineers and not making decisions based on their own skills.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how it all plays out considering that the FIA left the door open to interpretation through allowing some messages and not others.\n\nTeams are already devising coded messages to relay information to drivers on items outside the permitted parameters and give them what they need to know without actually telling them outright.\n\nF1 outfits used team orders when they were banned in much the same way. That's one of the problems with having some of the world's smartest people in the pitlane: They always figure out a way to do what they need to do.\n\nIf all else fails, maybe the teams will break out the old standby pit boards, which were not banned by the FIA.", "Hey, at least the guy earned his $10 million, although we certainly can debate whether Billy Horschel should have been eligible for it in the first place. A 125-man postseason? That's a jailbreak, not a playoff format. One top-10 finish in 22 full-field, regular-season starts? That's a 7-11 conference record and 17-15 overall - not exactly worthy of a ticket to the Big Dance.\n\nIn the 10 \u00bd months prior to The Barclays, where he would miss the cut, Horschel dropped steadily in the world ranking (34 to 59). He loitered outside the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings from mid-March onward, closing at 69, yet he'd earned enough points to qualify for the season-ending playoff derby by the first week of June.\n\nIt's a system designed primarily to cushion the blow of mediocrity, and Horschel took complete advantage. He ran the table at precisely the right time, and when Rory McIlroy's limousine ran out of gas a mile short of the Atlanta branch of Finchem Savings & Loan, we had ourselves a 2013-14 champion.\n\nSo the hottest golfer in the world, who happens to be an American, won't be at Gleneagles, which happens to be the site of next week's Ryder Cup. And the Yanks happen to be something akin to a two-touchdown underdog, which leaves me to wonder if one of our boys might suddenly pull a hammy or happen to come down with flu-like symptoms.\n\nLooking for all the drama this year's postseason derby couldn't provide? Horschel's wife, Brittany, is expecting their first child Sept. 27 - Day 2 of U.S. vs. the Euros.\n\n\"I honestly wasn't going to play in the Ryder Cup if we couldn't induce labor early,\" Horschel said Sunday night. \"When I started playing [poorly] this year, I put it out of my mind that I'd get picked. Obviously I wasn't, and it's going to work out perfectly.\"\n\nWell, sort of. If Billy Ho's hotness doesn't convince the PGA of America to start holding a captain's pick until the week before the matches, perhaps future team sweaters should be woven from the wool of a sacrificial lamb. I stand by the notion that choosing hot players is overrated, simply because there's close to a month between the selections and the first national anthem.\n\nIt doesn't take long for any tour pro to cool off, but then, we've never had a situation like this.\n\n\"I still don't feel like I deserve to be on the team,\" Horschel added.\n\nPardon me, William, but that's not for you or Brittany's obstetrician to decide.\n\nNINETY PERCENT AIR. If you're a 16 handicap spending an afternoon in the right trees, it's an adage steeped in optimism, an unofficial measure of hope with potentially expensive consequences. If you're a tour pro such as McIlroy, you simply whip out a wedge and fly it over the wooded area, as he did Sunday at East Lake's par-5 ninth.\n\nThere was a problem, however, and it also came with expensive consequences: McIlroy was cooked. The familiar bounce in his step was gone, his pursuit of the FedEx Cup overall title punctured by a tee shot that didn't come close to finding land at the par-3 sixth. A modest back-nine rally would leave him three strokes behind Horschel, with whom he began the day sharing the lead.\n\nThe scenario would bear a passing resemblance to 2012, when McIlroy entered the final round three strokes off the pace and in excellent position to claim the $10 million, only to stumble home with a 74. In both cases, he entered the Tour Championship as the game's best player, riding a stretch of dominance but unable to apply a finishing kick on the season's last day.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a few days off and not seeing my golf clubs for a little while,\" were the first words from the Irish Lad's mouth in his post-round press gathering. \"And then, when I'm ready and excited to get back out again, I'll get ready for the Ryder Cup.\"\n\nWhat should be of significant concern in Camp Ponte Vedra is McIlroy's long-term commitment to the four-week postseason, particularly in Ryder Cup years. Not only has he squandered two pretty good chances to win the pot o' gold; he has done it at points in his career when he had nothing to prove.\n\nWhen you've won back-to-back majors and a World Golf Championship, as McIlrampage did this summer - or a major and back-to-back playoff tilts, as he did in '12 - additional participation becomes solely about money. If rich people don't buy lottery tickets, greatness doesn't chase cash, and McIlroy's body language suggested a pronounced lack of interest once things went wrong Sunday.\n\nHe's Player of the Year, hands down, owner of one of the best non-Tiger seasons in the modern era. Sunday's falter doesn't change that a bit, although it is very likely to change how McIlragged arranges his schedule in future Septembers.\n\n\"If I had to do it all over again, I probably would have taken a week off somewhere in this stretch of tournaments,\" said a guy who already had been wobbly about playing four straight. \"Not that you feel obligated, but you want to support the events and give the sponsors something to be happy about and proud of. I've got a great relationship with BMW, and that was probably the only reason I did play in Denver.\"\n\nAhem, it's nice to know the young man has his priorities in order.\n\nNOW THAT I'VE gone over the FedEx Cup playoff results for like the 19 time, I thought it might be interesting to review how America's 12 Ryder Cuppers performed at each event.\n\nA little too much information for you to consume at this point in the day? Allow me to help with some crib notes:\n\nSkipper Tom Watson's dubious dozen accumulated 13 top-10s in 50 total starts. Mahan obviously picked up the only victory - that's why he's on the team. What strikes me about the data is how infrequently U.S. players contended on any of the four Sundays, although a spot in the final-round hunt is a subjective appraisal.\n\nFor instance, I'm unwilling to give Fowler credit for contending at the Tour Championship. He finished solo eighth, six back, and wasn't a realistic factor after a water ball at the sixth. There are lots of different ways to finish T-5, as Kuchar did at The Barclays - Kooch ended up one shot ahead of third-round co-leader Jim Furyk. Although neither had a chance of winning as the tournament reached its homestretch, I'll begrudgingly give both credit for contending because they finished within four of Mahan.\n\nAs was the case a month ago, Furyk and Fowler remain America's most consistent players - both performed solidly at all four postseason affairs. Neither, however, has won in forever, which means whatever you want it to mean. You want hot golfers? Talk to Brittany Horschel's doctor.", "Nissan Motor Co. 7201.TO -0.33% Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.

More quote details and news \" RNO.FR in Your Value Your Change Short position are looking for ways to reduce battery costs and share more components between electric vehicles, but they don't plan to shutter battery factories in the U.S. and U.K.\n\nThe companies, which share partial ownership and technology, frequently review their battery procurement efforts as part of the effort to reduce costs on the electric Nissan Leaf and the Renault Zoe, a company official said. The review, however, doesn't contemplate reducing employment or production at battery factories in the U.S. or the United Kingdom, the company said, responding to a report by Reuters Monday.\n\n\"The Renault-Nissan Alliance remains 100% committed to its industry-leading EV program. This global commitment continues for the foreseeable future, and we haven't taken any decision whatsoever to modify battery sourcing allocation. Nissan has no plans to impair its battery investments,\" said Rachel Konrad, the chief spokeswoman for the Nissan-Renault Alliance.\n\nCarlos Ghosn, the chairman and chief executive officer of both Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, has been one of the most bullish supporters of electric cars among the major auto executives in the world. Nissan and Renault have invested more than $4 billion in developing electric cars and have built battery factories in the U.S., England and Japan to supply packs.\n\nIn the U.S., Nissan received a $1.4 billion low-interest loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to finance its battery plant in Smyrna, Tenn. The plant opened near the end of 2012, creating a domestic source of batteries for the Nissan Leaf electric car, which reduced that car's price by more than $6,000. The company official said that shuttering the plant isn't a consideration and wouldn't even be feasible under the terms of the loan agreement.\n\nStill, Renault and Nissan are looking for ways to lower battery costs, the biggest single input to the cost of an electric vehicle.\n\nAt an event today in France, Mr. Ghosn responded to a question about whether the Renault-Nissan alliance's supply arrangement would remain in place by saying: \"The battery is a means. The objective is the car.\"\n\nSales of the Leaf have been averaging around 3,000 a month in the U.S. in 2014, a 30% increase over 2013, but still are far below the 150,000 annual rate that Mr. Ghosn had hoped for. The plant in Smyrna is capable of building battery packs for up to 200,000 vehicles annually.\n\nGlobally, sales of electric vehicles have trailed lofty expectations. Europe has particularly been difficult to crack. And sales of electric cars in China have been far lower than hoped for as the combination of limited recharging infrastructure and the high cost of EVs has put a lid on demand.\n\nIn the U.S., sales of electric vehicles are concentrated in pockets around the government, where state governments have offered tax incentives or access to high-occupancy vehicle lanes on the freeway, in addition to the U.S. tax credit of $7,500 toward electric vehicles.\n\nAll told, fewer than 1% of vehicles sold today are plug-in electric cars. Mr. Ghosn, in 2010, ahead of the release of the Leaf, forecast that in 2020 10% of all new car sales would be electric vehicles, a forecast that today seems impossible to reach.\n\nWrite to Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com", "Insurance firm put aside \u00a3500k contingency fund to deal with bogus car crash\n\nEight fraudsters made up a car crash that could have led to insurers paying out a potential \u00a3580,000.\n\nFive of the men were convicted over the \"cash-for-crash\" scam that saw bogus claims submitted over a supposed accident in Birkenhead.\n\nA judge today warned that such fake claims had reached \"epidemic proportions\" in Britain.\n\nLiverpool Crown Court heard Brian Williams, Michael Lee, Jon Paul Realey, David Thompson and Robert Davies submitted fake claims over a \"crash\" in January 2010 at junction of Beresford Road and Alton Road.\n\nThey and three other men, who were handed cautions, admitted making up the \"accident\" and then submitting bogus claims to Liverpool Victoria.\n\nWilliams had reported to LV that he was driving his Vauxhall Vectra with three passengers when he skidded and crashed into Lee's BMW X5, which was apparently carrying Realey, Thompson and Davies.\n\nJames Rae, prosecuting, said: \"Mr Williams claimed that he was driving down the hill on Beresford Road and when he came to the junction he failed to stop, skidded across the junction and struck a BMW five series that was owned on finance by Michael Lee and was supposedly being driven across his path along Alton Road.\n\n\"The scenario would be repeated by Michael Lee as well, and in due course by the other defendants in the case.\n\n\"There is no doubt that both vehicles suffered damage but the crux of the Crown's case is that the damage that was sustained by the vehicles was inconsistent with the accounts being given and that, however the damage was contrived, it had not been by way of a traffic accident at the junction of Beresford and Alton roads.\n\n\"This case is actually part of a wider investigation the principal focus of which is the activities of a claims management company and its associated car recovery companies. That remains ongoing.\"\n\nThe eight men subsequently submitted claims to LV for whiplash-type injuries, while Williams and Lee also sought payment for their written-off cars. On top of this Lee claimed for car hire replacement costs at \u00a3256 per day. There were also claims for recovery and storage fees from a claims management company, Car Logix.\n\nThe court heard that LV set aside reserves of more than \u00a3580k against the possibility of the fraudulent claims succeeding, primarily on the basis of steep hire car charges continuing to March 2012 being paid out.\n\nBetween January 20 and November 30, 2010, car hire invoices submitted by Lee's solicitors had totalled almost \u00a383,000. They were later retracted when Lee admitted that he had lied.\n\nInvestigations later revealed that Lee, a failed businessman, had been due to pay the final \u00a312k installment on his BMW when the staged crash took place. Robert Wyn Jones, defending, said \"financial hardship\" led him into the scam.\n\nJudge Andrew Menary heard that Williams would have benefitted from the money LV paid out for the Vectra, some \u00a32,500, but that he was assumed to have expected some \"additional recompense.\"\n\nThe \"passengers\" in the car expected a personal injury payout in the region of \u00a34,000.\n\nThe attempted fraud came completely unstuck when the three men who said they had been in Williams' Vauxhall admitted they had not been involved in any accident and that their claims were fraudulent.\n\nWilliams, Lee, Realey, Thompson and Davies were subsequently charged with and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.\n\nJudge Menary said: \"If there even was a collision between these two cars it was dishonestly staged.\"\n\n\"No-one suffered any injury at all, no cars were damaged in this accident because there was no accident. It was all a complete pretence.\n\n\"But it allowed eight people to take advantage of this scam and if successful it would have cost the insurance company at least many tens of thousands of pounds.\"\n\nRealey, 27, of Fountain Street, Birkenhead; Thompson, 52, of Cambridge Road, Birkenhead; and Davies, 57, of Dickens Avenue, Prenton, each received eight month suspended sentences.\n\nLee, 50, of Bolton Road, Port Sunlight, was jailed for a year. Williams, 47, of Peel Road, Bootle was jailed for eight months.\n\nAll were said to be remorseful.", "On the morning of Saturday, September 13, a fleet of old and new school cars packed the Herb Chambers BMW of Sudbury lot for the dealership's \"Cars and Coffee\" event. The venue offered owners of classic, vintage, and downright flashy cars a chance to show off their prized possessions. Meanwhile, car buffs and spectators got a chance to gaze and gawk at an impressive array of road candy.\n\nThis was the sixth \"Cars and Coffee\" event of the 2014 season. Chambers' dealerships hold the gatherings at various locations between April and October on the second Saturday of each month.\n\n\"Regardless of what type of car you drive or like, it's a relaxed place to meet and talk about a common interest,\" said BMW of Sudbury General Manager Pranav Gill.", "Just as smartphones have become supercomputers in our pockets, the Apple Watch and its many competitors, including \u00adAndroid-powered devices from Motorola MSI and Samsung Electronics, are poised to become something more.\n\nAnd it is their central place in a larger ecosystem of apps and hardware, rather than any one thing that has been shown off \u00adrecently, that will make them indispensable.\n\n\"There's so much (the Apple Watch) can do that we haven't \u00adreally even talked about,\" Tim Cook told USA Today on the day of the announcement.\n\nWhen a company like Google or Apple deliberately creates a place for other companies to sell their own, complementary wares, it is called a platform. Apple, more than Google, has mastered this art, having worked hard to give developers the tools to make apps for its mobile devices, plus a controlled environment in which to profit from them.\n\nFortunately, we don't have to wait for the Apple Watch and its app store to become available to get a glimpse of where things could be going. We have only to look at what pioneering companies in \"wearables\" are working on, and then think about how their products will become a part of -- or be absorbed by -- the Apple Watch and Android Wear ecosystems.\n\n\"The vision of Sensoria is that the garment is the next ultra personal computer,\" says Sensoria chief executive Davide Vigano. To illustrate his point, he rolls up his pants leg to show me a working prototype of the world's first smart sock.\n\nI know, it sounds ridiculous. But as he explains with the help of an iPhone app that visualises wireless signals sent by indiscernibly thin pressure sensors in the sock, it is good for runners who want to reduce their chance of \u00adinjury.\n\nIt is also potentially useful for monitoring the health of the elderly, since changes in gait are surprisingly predictive of other health issues. And yes, the smart sock is washable.\n\nSensoria also makes a smart bra and smart shirt, both of which can measure heart rate. And here's where things get really interesting: For all makers of wearables, which until recently have been dominated by the glorified pedometers known as fitness bands, fitness applications are just the beginning.\n\nUsing a few more of the sensors it already carries, Sensoria's shirt could measure not just the frequency but the unique pattern of a wearer's heartbeat, Mr Vigano says.\n\nLike the fingerprint sensor on smartphones, the unique shape of the electrical signals generated by our hearts are a biometric.\n\nAdd in a payment terminal and the wearer of a Sensoria undergarment could soon find herself verifying payment for her next coffee via technology in her bra.\n\nOne company, Bionym, is already doing something like this. Its Nymi wristband is an ultra-secure means of personal identification. Put it on and touch it for four seconds, and it takes an electrocardiogram with a fidelity comparable to what you would get in a hospital. It is then matched with a previous distillation of your heartbeat pattern stored in the cloud.\n\nOnce you put on a Nymi, until you take it off, it uniquely identifies you. Current applications include unlocking your laptop or smartphone, but Bionym chief executive Karl Martin says his company is also working on a version that can be used for contactless payments, just like many smartphones (including the iPhone 6) and the Apple Watch.\n\nDuring Apple's presentation, vice-president Kevin Lynch said BMW had developed an app for the Apple Watch that would allow users to lock and unlock their BMW i-series electric vehicles. And Mr Martin said new Bluetooth-enabled locks mean that from the moment you walk up to a door while sporting a recognised wearable it can unlock without a touch.\n\nPut all these possibilities together and what you get is a suite of functions that could almost, but not quite, be conveniently accomplished by a smartphone.\n\nJust as Uber could in theory work on a PC but didn't really make sense until the dawn of the smartphone, body-wide wireless networks and computers we never take off will create applications that simply don't exist yet.\n\nWearables won't just appeal to fitness nuts and quantified-self geeks. They will appeal to everyone, because they will be the primary, perhaps even the sole way we identify ourselves to a world full of smart objects.\n\nEstablished makers of wearables have seen this trend and are already getting in front of it. On the same day that Apple announced its watch, Jawbone, maker of the UP wristband, said it was opening up its quantified-self software so that anyone could connect it with devices other than the UP -- including the Apple Watch.\n\nOr in other words, amid the hype about the Apple Watch being a fitness device, or a timepiece, or a status symbol, it is the applications that Apple and others aren't even talking about, the ones that are thought up by countless developers jumping on board the platform, that will make us wonder how we ever got by without them.\n\nThese devices will be the way we connect ourselves -- directly -- to all the technology that surrounds us. And opting out simply won't be an option.", "NEW YORK/FRANKFURT: German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen has reached a deal to buy US-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp for $105.60 per share in cash, creating a global automotive supply powerhouse.\n\nThe transaction values the US company at nearly $12 billion based on shares outstanding, and has an enterprise value of $13.5 billion including assumption of debt, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nThe merger would create one of the world's largest automotive suppliers with combined annual revenue exceeding $40 billion. ZF, a major provider of steering systems and powertrains, would get a leading maker of automotive safety products, such as brakes and air bags.\n\nThe deal price represents a premium of 16 per cent over TRW's closing price on July 9 before news of ZF's buyout interest first emerged.\n\nThe price represents a multiple of 7.6 times TRW's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the year ended June 2014, making it one of the most expensive takeovers in the auto parts sector.\n\nZF on Monday announced the sale of its steering unit to Robert Bosch GmbH, a move to clear antitrust hurdles as part of a broader combination with TRW.\n\nReuters first reported on July 30 that ZF was in advanced talks to buy TRW for around $105 per share, but wanted to have a plan to divest its steering business before finalizing the deal.\n\nTRW, based in Livonia, Michigan, makes airbags, electronics, and braking and steering equipment for cars globally. It sells to nearly all major automakers, including Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co\n\nThe company, which had sales of $17.43 billion last year, counts Volkswagen AG as its largest customer and gets about 40 per cent of its revenue from Europe.\n\nPrivately owned ZF Friedrichshafen, which supplies chassis components to companies including Audi AG and BMW , generates about half of its revenue in Europe and posted 2013 revenue of 16.84 billion euros ($21.7 billion).\n\nZF, which already helps carmakers develop hybrid-powered drivetrains, has been on the lookout for a strategic partner after an analysis showed them that semi-autonomous driving functions and vehicle connectivity will develop into important new business areas.\n\nBuying TRW is an attempt by ZF to increase its exposure to sensors and electronic components. Stricter safety and anti-pollution rules have forced carmakers to install more complex onboard electronics that help to make acceleration, braking and engine management systems more intelligent.", "Jobless Nathan Myles, 23, raced Ryan Ross, 22, for five minutes on a busy dual carriageway unaware they were being followed by an unmarked police car\n\nA man who raced a total stranger at more than 100mph on a busy main road with an 18-month-old child strapped in the back of his car has been told he faces jail.\n\nNathan Myles sped along the A92 dual carriageway between Carnoustie and Dundee in Scotland racing Ryan Ross after coming upon each other on the road.\n\nThe pair - who had never met before - tailgated each other and other motorists completely unaware that they were being followed by an unmarked police car.\n\nForfar Sheriff Court heard their five minute race - with Myles in an Audi A3 and Ross in his BMW - saw them flooring it along at speeds of between 97 and 105mph.\n\nAnd when they were finally pulled over cops found Myles had his sister and an 18-month-old toddler on board.\n\nA sheriff branded the pair's stunt \"five minutes of madness\".\n\nHe fined Ross \u00a31,000 - but warned Myles he faces a prison sentence.\n\nMyles was told: \"Any person who drives like this with young children in the car like you did faces potential imprisonment.\"\n\nForfar Sheriff Court heard the incident took place on a Saturday afternoon in April.\n\nFiscal depute Hannah Kennedy said both cars were seen by police travelling at \"excessive\" speed in the inside lane, with Ross in front and Myles behind.\n\nThe prosecutor said the pair braked frequently as they tailgated other cars with their speeds topping out at 105mph.\n\nOffshore technician Ross, 22, of Thorter Neuk, Dundee, and Myles, 23, of Weavers Close, Arbroath, pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving committed on April 26.\n\nDavid Duncan, defending Ross, said there was \"no connection\" between the pair \"other than their standard of driving\".\n\nHe said: \"He describes his behaviour, quite appropriately, as madness and there is no better explanation than that.\n\n\"He has now sold that particular car, partly because he knows what is going to happen to him, but also because he recognises the difficulty of young men having powerful cars.\n\n\"He is looking to put this matter behind him and is more than determined there will be no repeat of this kind of conduct.\"\n\nIan Flynn, for Myles, added: \"He's 23, unemployed and on Jobseekers Allowance.\n\n\"His only mitigation is that he was a stupid, stupid person on that day.\n\n\"His licence is clean but he expects to lose that for a lengthy period.\n\n\"His passenger never at any point complained about his driving - but he accepts any normal person probably would have.\n\n\"It was beyond the pale.\n\n\"He realises just how stupid he has been and what could have happened.\"\n\nSheriff Gregor Murray fined Ross \u00a31,000 and deferred sentence on Myles until next month for social work background reports that are required by law before a first offender can face a custodial sentence.\n\nHe told Myles: \"Any person who drives like this with young children in the car like you did faces potential imprisonment.\n\n\"You will be disqualified in the interim.\n\n\"You will come back on a date in October to be sentenced.\"\n\nAddressing Ross, the sheriff said: \"I accept that in other aspects of your life you are a sensible young man, but five minutes of madness is going to cost you dearly.\"", "The 2014 GS Trophy is a wrap, with Team Central and Eastern Europe winning the event.\n\nThe GS Trophy is a skills competition run by BMW, pitting big-bike adventure riders from around the globe against each other, showing their off-road prowess and other skills on their Beemers.

Luxury vehicle divisions Volkswagen AG's Audi, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors's Jaguar Land Rover faced probes from China's antitrust regulator, due to alleged monopolistic practices of inflating vehicle and spare parts prices, which subsequently prompted these automakers to lower product prices in China last month. China probes possibly hurting profits, coupled with tepid sales outlook in the politically troubled Eastern Europe, weighed on automotive stocks, which performed weaker than broader indices this week.\n\nBelow we discuss key events from last week in relation to the automotive companies in discussion.\n\nVolkswagen\n\nVolkswagen looks like it is on its way to overtake Toyota as the world's largest automaker this year, crossing 10 million unit sales for the first time. But the German giant suffered a setback this week as China's antitrust regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission, fined the company's joint venture FAW-Volkswagen 249 million RMB ($40.6 million) for monopolistic practices pertaining to highly inflated vehicle and spare part prices for its luxury division Audi. The regulatory body also fined eight Audi dealerships a total of 29 million RMB.\n\nThis fine represents only 0.7% of the net operating profits made by Volkswagen last year in China, it's single largest market. In view of the investigation, Audi has already reduced its auto spare part prices in the country by up to 38%. This reduction might not significantly impact revenues per unit and consequently margins, as only around 10% of the net automotive revenue comes from spare parts, and should be even lesser in China, due to the country's relatively young fleet. In addition, Volkswagen is the largest automaker in China, and hopes to make up the deficit through economies of scale and improvement in operational efficiencies.\n\nWe have a $48.14 price estimate for Volkswagen AG, which is roughly 7% above the current market price. The stock price fell by 1.4% in the last five days.\n\nSee Our Complete Analysis For Volkswagen AG\n\nVolkswagen also announced this week that it will halt production in Russia for 10 days, as political uncertainties in the region and negative consumer sentiment continue to drag down vehicle sales. The company sold over 3% of its volumes in Russia last year, but volumes have declined by a high-single-digit percent so far this year in the country, prompting the company to cut down production at its Kaluga plant in Russia. Vehicle production could fall to 120,000 units this year in the country, down from the previously planned 150,000 units, operating at just over half the facility's production capacity. Due to high operating leverage, Volkswagen's profitability could be negatively impacted by lower volumes and higher fixed costs in Russia this year.\n\nDaimler\n\nApart from Audi, Chrysler was also fined by the Chinese regulators for monopolistic practices. The third-highest selling luxury vehicle brand in China, Mercedes-Benz, has also been found guilty of artificially inflating vehicle and spare part prices, and could be the next to receive a multi-million pound fine for the same in China. Mercedes also reduced its spare part prices in China last month by an average of 15%, though it is likely that a higher proportion of local production and economies of scale could offset the possible decline in profitability in the country.\n\nWe have a $87.12 price estimate for Daimler AG, which is roughly 8% above the current market price. The stock fell 1.7% in the last five days.\n\nSee Our Complete Analysis For Daimler AG\n\nLast week also marked the unveiling of the Mercedes-AMG GT, a sports car to be launched next year. This model is the second sports car entirely made by Mercedes-AMG, and will heat up the competition in the higher-end of the luxury vehicle market, competing with the likes of Jaguar F-Type and Porsche 911 Turbo. While the GT won't be a volume model for Mercedes-AMG, with an estimated starting price of nearly $180,000, the model will boost average revenue per unit for the company, which was around $102,445 for the company's super-luxury division last year.\n\nThe GT being relatively more expensive could carry fatter margins and help Mercedes meet its mid-term target of 9-10% operating margins. Mercedes, whose operating margins stood at around 7.9% last quarter, lags behind both Audi and BMW, who consistently report 9.5-10.5% operating margins.\n\nTata Motors\n\nRiding on strong growth for Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors' stock has surged by over 20% in the last three months, while both Daimler and Volkswagen stocks declined. However, the Indian automobile company was the weakest performing stock out of the three companies in discussion this week, possibly hurt by rumors of fines from the Chinese regulators. China is JLR's largest market, and in view of this investigation, the luxury vehicle division also reduced prices for two Range Rover models and the sports car Jaguar F-Type Cabriolet by up to 19% in the country. Tata's standalone Indian automotive division was also fined a massive $222 million last month by India's antitrust regulator. Fines for Tata Motors in India and a possible fine by China are expected to dent the automaker's finances this year.\n\nTrefis price estimate for Tata Motors is $47.36, which is in line with the current market price. The stock price fell by 2.1% in the last five days.\n\nSee Our Complete Analysis For Tata Motors\n\nJaguar also unveiled the XE this week, its first compact luxury saloon in five years. The XE is set to be a volume model for Jaguar, which will compete with bestsellers such as BMW 3-series, Audi A3 and A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class in the lower-end of the premium vehicle market, following its launch in early 2015. The new XE is based on an aluminium monocoque, providing a weight saving advantage to Jaguar. In fact, the XE uses RC 5754, an aluminium alloy made predominantly from recycled material. In a bid to become more environmentally friendly and reduce CO2 emissions, Jaguar plans to use this alloy in the coming models as well, aiming to use 75% recycled material by the end of the decade. In the long run, by using recycled material and an integrated manufacturing model, JLR could considerably enhance profitability.\n\nSee More at Trefis | View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis)\n\nGet Trefis Technology\n\nLike our charts?

It became a playful, very human space in the heart of one of London's most august institutions, and remains one of the most talked-about festival projects of recent years.\n\nIt's an enormous space to work in anyway, notwithstanding this pressured LDF pedigree, nor the fact that because the pictures belong to the Queen, any installation needs express permission from the Royal Household. But Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby have stepped up to the challenge and created something as extraordinary, if not more so.\n\nDouble Space for BMW - Precision and Poetry In Motion takes the form of two huge reflective structures suspended from the gallery ceiling. They stretch almost the entire length of the room and take up most of the width, an impressive enough sight before they start swinging back and forth in a choreographed dance designed to \"reflect and distort the view of the Raphael Cartoons, the architecture of the room and the viewer's perception of the space.\"", "Upon learning from David Landis that Uber is offering a \"ride-sharing\" option, allowing strangers to sit side by side to get from one place to another, Michele Heisler asked, \"Isn't that called Muni?\"\n\nIgnazio Marino, mayor of Rome, was in town last week, and Consul General of Italy Mauro Battocchi hosted a reception for him. Driving there, I was thinking that his interests here would be the usual ones that have occupied visiting dignitaries in recent years: technology and business.\n\nBut, \"up to a few hours ago,\" he said, standing at the door to greet people arriving, \"I was discussing how good you are at separating garbage.\"\n\nThe mayor, a Roman-born liver transplant surgeon here in the United States before he changed careers and turned to politics, is an environmentalist. Up to a few years ago, he said, Rome's garbage was dumped into landfill. In a year since he's been in office, and since people have started sorting it, 40 percent has been recycled, nowhere near what we in San Francisco do - Take pride! We are the garbage heroes of the world! - but he's hoping to get to 65 percent in the next year. \"We want to change,\" said the mayor.\n\nSo here's to change and here's to the past: A second objective of his visit was Marino's asking for guests' support of restoration of Rome's art, archaeology and antiquities. In a perfectly executed presentation of projected images and music, he talked about treasures of his cities in need of care, including the aqueducts, marvels of engineering. When they were built 2,000 years ago, said Marino, Rome was a city of a million people. \"And most of them had running water in their homes.\" (London didn't achieve that size and sophistication for more than 1,800 years.)\n\nHis description of one of his early mayoral decisions, closing to traffic the road that ran around the Colosseum (\"popular with tourists, very unpopular with the Romans\"), sounded familiar in this city of traffic battles.\n\n\"If you had a monument like the Colosseum in San Francisco,\" said Marino, \"you would not use it as a roundabout for 25,000 cars a day.\"\n\nThe mayor's talk utilized the technical wizardry of modern show-and-tell. But the real issues he was discussing are those of every mayor in every city, ancient as Rome, relatively new as San Francisco. It's all about the infrastructure.\n\n-- As to free subscriptions to Playboy being halted, novelist/memoirist Herbert Gold, who'd often contributed to the magazine, says that his subscription was pulled a few years ago. He's been making do, he said, by reading Kierkegaard. And if any barbers out there who are similarly deprived of Playboy want to have his cast-off copies of the works of the philosopher, he'll trade them in exchange for a beard trim. But trader beware, they're in Danish.\n\n-- Oh, there's skulduggery in the Sunset. Wendy Withers sent a police report clipping from the Sunset Beacon: \"To lighten the difficulty of moving, a man hired a moving assistant to bring his furniture to his new residence. The suspect reported for duty with a truck and two helpers. After loading the man's possessions the three workers required payment for their services. The victim complied and the workers drove off. They did not, however, ever arrive at the victim's new residence to unload the furniture.\"\n\n-- On Panoramic Way in Berkeley, Richard Snider says that someone hacked into PG&E's electronic sign warning of road repair.

More than that, this year has offered McIlroy a practical snapshot.\n\nMcIlroy's failure to claim the FedEx Cup in Atlanta on Sunday was hardly a disaster. Those who had paid close attention to him in recent weeks would have seen traces of the mental fatigue which is a natural consequence of a stunningly successful summer. By his own admission, McIlroy could not summon the energy for one final tilt at glory. Competing comes at a cost.\n\nMcIlroy has only appeared at the FedEx play-off finale twice, this year and in 2012, with opportunities to claim the $10m (\u00a37m) bonus attached to victory evading him on both occasions.\n\n\"I really wanted to win,\" he said. \"I really wanted to cap this year off well, even though it's still been a great year. I was coming in with really high hopes and expectations, and I haven't quite been able to play the golf to live up to those.\n\n\"It's still been a great season for me and there's still a little bit of golf left. I'm looking forward to this little bit of time off and getting back at it, maybe next weekend, to get ready for the Ryder Cup.\"\n\nThe Open and US PGA champion's year is far from over. McIlroy will compete at a Ryder Cup and in individual events in Bermuda, Dubai, China and Australia before the end of the 2014 season. Sunday at East Lake looked like an important moment, though, with McIlroy feeling the strain of four FedEx events in succession.\n\n\"It's been a long four weeks,\" McIlroy said. \"You know, if I had to do it all over again, I probably would have taken a week off somewhere in this stretch of tournaments.\n\n\"It's tough because these sponsors that are sponsoring the tournaments and the FedEx Cup play-offs, they're putting up an awful lot of money to get the best players in the world to their event. Not that you feel obliged, but you want to support the events, you want to show up and give the sponsors something to be happy about and proud of.\n\n\"I've got a great relationship with BMW and that was probably the only reason why I did play in Denver [at the BMW Championship] last week. But at the same time, if I had to do it again, I probably would have taken a week off just to feel a little fresher coming to Atlanta.\"\n\nThe back-to-back FedEx series is unlikely to be repeated. It was understood to be the idea of Tom Watson, who wanted a clear break before he leads the United States into the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles from Friday 26 September.\n\nTwo years ago, the Tour Championship immediately preceded the Ryder Cup, a matter Watson identified as troublesome during his discussions over the USA captaincy. That is notable, given the number of players who have made it clear that a hectic tournament run this time around has taken its toll.\n\n\"I think a week off will do a lot of us a world of good,\" said McIlroy, who was far from alone in citing East Lake tiredness. \"It really will. As I said already, I don't want to see my clubs for a few days and I'll pick them back up again probably at the weekend.\n\n\"Having these five days off is going to be big and I think a lot of guys will do the same thing. I don't think tiredness or fatigue will play a part in the Ryder Cup,\" McIlroy said. \"Now that all this is over, I'll start thinking about it a lot more over the next few days and obviously get very excited about it. It's a great way to get right back on the horse and get back at it. It's always a phenomenal week and I'm sure it'll be the same this time.\"", "At one point in time the weight of VW's brand aspirations fell upon the Passat. Today's Nice Price or Crack Pipe W8 wagon is an example of that one-time up-market push, but does this unique car come with a price you will H8?\n\nDo you recall when Volkswagen tried to get all fancy with its product line, despite the obvious conflict with their existing premium brand, Audi? That was all the idea of then VW chairman, Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who felt the answer to Mercedes moving down-market with the A and B class was for Volkswagen to go upscale and hit the Swabians where it hurt, in the high-margin luxo arena. The two cars that were VW's initial attack on the fancy pants market were the W8 Passat and the brand's uber-car, the Phaeton. These two made for a Pi\u00ebch of a pair.\n\nThe aspirations of Pi\u00ebch and hence Volkswagen never really panned out as it's hard to erase the low-rent stigma of 21-million Beetles, nor the marque's appalling drop in reliability at the same time they were trying to attract rich people's money.\n\nYou don't have to be a blue blood to be attracted to this 2003 VW Passat wagon, but you'll likely be a red-blooded Jalop if you are drawn to it. That's because this B5.5 hits almost all the right keys.\n\nFirst off, it's a wagon, and I think we can all agree that this generation was one of the best-looking of VW's mid-sized longroofs. Next up, it's a W8 - which is VW-speak for what's essentially a pair of VR-4 engines sharing a common crank. It's remarkably compact fore to aft, but like Kanye's wife, it's pretty damn wide. The DOHC eight, as found in the Passat, pushed out 270-bhp at 6,000 rpm, and a healthy 273 lb-ft of torque at only 2,750.\n\nFollowing up on the hit list is a 6-speed stick. Yep, this W8 let's you row your own. Boom!\n\nWhen you do exercise your right arm and left leg you'll be confident to know that your actions will be affecting all four tires, as the car is a 4motion AWD.\n\nHoly crap! This is an eight-cylinder, manual equipped awd wagon of Germanic origins. You can't get anything like that outside of\u00e2\u0080\u015a well, Audi. Mercedes and BMW also offered AWD wagons that rolled eights, but I don't know how easy it would be to find one of those with a stick. As it is, the ad claims this VW to be only one of about 100 to arrive in the U.S. so equipped.\n\nThe ad also says that the car comes with 101,000 miles on the clock and a straight, accident-free body.

Once in the car, it operates as the proximity key, for the push-button starts. According to the company, the watch can also open the trunk and will lock the K3 when the wearer walks away.\n\nThe K3 watch is not the first such foray into wearables as remote starters. There are several iPhone and Android-based aftermarket smart watch apps that can lock/unlock/remote-start a car, such as SmartStart from Viper. Clearly, there are more companies moving into this wearable car-tech space. At last week's Apple Watch announcement, BMW was named as a development partner for an Apple Watch app, though what the app would entail has not yet been released.\n\nThe K3 watch operates far differently than existing smart watch remote start apps. To start, aside from lock/unlock/stop-start operations, the K3 watch functions only as a timepiece rather than a do-it-all connected device. This may have real advantages: Smart-watch-backed vehicle remote systems require connection to the smart phone, which requires connection to the network -- as does the vehicle it is trying to operate. Since the K3 watch basically has the standard key fob tech, it does not need to be on a network. In other words, the K3 watch would work if you are locked out of your car in a remote location.\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether this watch system is coming to the U.S. market, but with the growing interest in wearable technology, there could be consumer pressure for Kia to expand the rollout to far more than just the select K3 owners.", "North East entrepreneurs Zoe Farrington and David Carr go head-to-head at a national event\n\nTwo promising entrepreneurial businesses are to go under the national spotlight after being chosen as North East leaders.\n\nZoe Farrington of REALsafe Technologies and David Carr of Frank &amp; Bird have been chosen as the region's Emerging Entrepreneurs to go forward to compete for the crown of national Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year.\n\nThey will vie for the title at one of the UK's biggest business events, the MADE 2014 Festival Gala Dinner on September 25 in Sheffield - part of a week-long festival inspiring entrepreneurship which is expected to attract 3,000 delegates from all over the UK.\n\nThe North East pair were chosen to attend the event - which is sponsored by Newcastle-headquartered Sage - by a distinguished panel of judges from a shortlist of 22 of the region's up-and-coming entrepreneurs.\n\nThe pair will go head-to-head with nominees from Scotland, Yorkshire and the West Midlands for the award, which is also sponsored by Sage.\n\nZoe Farrington is co-founder of REALsafe Technologies, developer of the smartphone app REALsafe, being piloted by the North East Ambulance Service, which detects if a motorbike rider has been involved in an accident and sends an alert.\n\nIt is the only app on the market to connect a rider directly to the NHS.\n\nThe Durham-based business, which was founded in 2012, employs four people and has raised \u00a3610,000 through venture capitalists, business angel and private investment and has teamed up with a major insurance quote comparison website.\n\nUS electric bike manufacturer Brammo has announced that REALsafe will be provided with every new bike sold in the UK this year.

Acura RLX sedan demonstrated an unusual way to tow another car last week: the vehicles were not physically attached. The second car drove itself, following instructions beamed over by the first in a feat of technology that indicates a new stage in automation is happening faster than many expected.\n\nSystems that enable vehicles to communicate with each other have been developed in recent years in parallel with features that enable cars to drive themselves. Manufacturers and suppliers in Japan and overseas now are putting the two together in novel ways, with broad implications for vehicle safety and convenience.\n\nHonda, General Motors Co. and other automakers are working with traditional suppliers and startup firms. Tech giants Google Inc., with its pioneering work on driverless cars, and Apple Inc., which is working with automakers to embed greater connectivity in their cars, are accelerating the change.\n\n\"It is the mix of big companies, Apple, Google, the automakers and the data aggregators, that starts to create momentum. Two years ago, it was different. It was a promise. Today, it's reality,\" said Laurens Eckelboom, executive vice president of business development at Parkmobile, a smart-parking start-up whose investors include BMW AG and Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford's venture capital firm Fontinalis Partners.\n\nA \"truck platooning\" application by Peloton Technology, a start-up based in California's Silicon Valley, is intended to save fuel and reduce collisions.\n\nAs with virtual towing, a \"platoon\" of two heavy trucks use wireless communication and computer-controlled braking and acceleration to keep in close formation on the highway, according to a description by the company, which expects to start selling the technology late next year at $2,000 per truck plus a share of the projected operating savings.\n\nThe total price tag for widespread adaptation of such features could be steep.The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates automakers will need to spend billions of dollars to install safety systems that automatically assist drivers and could be mandated by 2020, when the industry expects the first self-driving cars to start easing onto roads.\n\nThere are other risks and issues including reliability, cybersecurity and legal liability.\n\n\"What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human 'co-pilot' be at fault or will the car's manufacturer?\" the Center for Insurance Policy and Research wrote last month, citing \"a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road.\"\n\nAll the razzle-dazzle technology promised by automakers and regulators \"shouldn't take our eyes off the prize -- cars that don't crash,\" Jon Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer, said at the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit last week.\n\nCiti analyst Itay Michaeli said the convergence of connected and automated technologies also has the potential to reduce vehicle emissions and fuel usage, and bring down vehicle operating and insurance costs.\n\nActive safety, including hands-free driver assistance and accident avoidance, was a common thread of many technical discussions and technology advances on display at the ITS show, which attracted around 10,000 engineers, scientists and researchers.\n\nAutomakers are starting to put more of the new technologies on the road \"to get some experience and see how the market reacts in advance of the government requiring it,\" said Jeff Owens, chief technology officer at Delphi Automotive PLC.\n\nPrice is still a big question. Some advanced systems could cost two to three times more to develop than early adopters are likely to pay, several industry insiders estimated in conversations at the show.\n\nEven with just a few semi-automated systems installed, the price tag remains stiff, although recent studies have shown car buyers are willing to pay about $3,000 to have hands-free driving capability.\n\nThe Chrysler Group, a unit of Italy's Fiat SpA, is charging nearly $3,500 for a technology bundle on its new 2015 Chrysler 200C sedan, which includes adaptive cruise control that automatically applies brakes and throttle to keep a vehicle a safe distance behind the one ahead; lane departure warning with lane keep assist, which automatically redirects a vehicle that is drifting out of its traffic lane; blind spot and cross path detection, which helps the driver monitor the presence of vehicles, and automatic park assist.\n\nBut drivers should not expect to take a snooze. \"We are talking about 'automated' driving features, not autonomous driving,\" with Smart Cruise, warned spokesman Jim Cain. \"We will have strategies in place to keep the driver alert and engaged.\"", "Although most Mini models to date have had rear accommodations, those seats suggested more practicality than they actually delivered. The latest Mini Cooper hardtop, for example, is about as well-suited to carrying adult passengers in the back as a Little Tikes Cozy Coupe -- and that thing doesn't even have back seats. For 2015, however, Mini is finally delivering a practical five-door hatchback with more rear legroom and improved ingress and egress.\n\nThe Hardtop 4-Door, as Mini has dubbed it, packs 2.9 additional inches of wheelbase and is 6.3 inches longer overall. More than half of the extra wheelbase (1.5 inches) goes into rear seat legroom, and it transforms those perches into somewhat usable stowage for grown-ups. Steerage class still isn't spacious, but thanks to deeply hollowed out front seatbacks, a near-six-footer can sit behind a similarly sized driver without embedding his knees permanently in the seat structure. A slightly taller roof that's more horizontal than the three-door's provides adequate headroom.\n\nThe balance of the stretch goes into a larger luggage area, which grows from 8.7 to 13.1 cubic feet with the rear seat in place and from 38.0 to 40.7 with it folded. A new 60/40 folding seatback allows this additional volume to be allocated between passengers and stuff as needed. The Hardtop 4-Door still can't match the packaging magic of the Honda Fit, and is more like the Ford Fiesta in both exterior size and interior space.\n\nOf course, the Mini costs considerably more than either the Fiesta or the Fit. The two additional doors nick you for an additional $1000 over the basic Mini, with the base 2015 Cooper five-door costing $22,300 and the Cooper S version that we drove for this report starting at $25,950. That's roughly three grand more than a Ford Fiesta ST, a 10Best-winning, four-wheeled riot. And, of course, Mini offers far, far more options than Ford does, and so a 4-Door approaching $40,000 is within the realm of possibility.\n\nAutomatically Moved\n\nOur first drive in the 4-Door was limited to the Cooper S with the automatic transmission. Such a pairing is generally agreeable (if not terribly involving), as the modestly boosted 2.0-liter inline-four develops plenty of torque very quickly at even low rpm. It feels like a larger, naturally aspirated engine. Combined with a well-calibrated throttle and well-coordinated shift points, the powertrain produces smooth and linear thrust.\n\nLike its three-door sibling, this new model feels very solid and more substantial than its size. Steering effort is not light or heavily damped, yet it is more reactive than that of most other cars. Even so, the Cooper S, while agile, never feels twitchy. The larger body with the extra doors adds about 135 pounds to curb weight, an increment that isn't immediately obvious in the driving experience.\n\nOn English roads, the suspension calibration delivered a great combination of control and suppleness in its middle setting. But when switched to Sport, the shocks turned much firmer and made the car pogo over most bumps. This was perhaps to be expected -- a ring of LEDs around the central display glow red momentarily when you switch to Sport, while the center screen promises \"maximum go-kart feel\" and displays an outline of the car with a thought bubble near the driver's head that's filled with a picture of a rocket.\n\nSuch visual excitement is everywhere in this generation Mini Cooper; that same circular ring of LEDs also functions as a temperature-change indicator when you fiddle with the HVAC settings as well as a secondary tachometer during normal driving. There's also a large glowing arc of subtle lighting in all four door panels, as well as a gas gauge that consist of a series of discreet, horizontal LEDs.\n\nSuch visual creativity is what your money buys in a Mini. The interior of our Cooper S was well-executed and finished with highly sculpted, three-dimensional dash panels, elegant matte-finish wood trim, and lots of attractive brightwork. The switches and controls all feel high quality and move with precision.\n\nBritish via Bavaria\n\nThis should come as no surprise because this Mini is essentially a BMW under its skin. Although there are some different graphics, the infotainment system is pure iDrive and controlled by a large central knob. The small screen in the speedometer dial is also straight from the Bimmer parts pile, and is controlled by a button at the end of the turn signal stalk just like it is on any BMW. Even most of the engineers and marketing experts on hand spoke with strong German accents.\n\nGoing farther, the mechanical bones of this car have deep BMW roots. The four-cylinder engine in the Cooper S as well as the three-cylinder variant in the base Cooper, are members of the new engine family that will soon be under the hood of most BMWs. Similarly, this front-drive architecture also will form the basis of the next generation 1-series cars -- marking the first time that a BMW sedan exclusively will drive the wheels up front.\n\nAll of this to say that, in addition to its iconic and high style, this Mini delivers BMW technology in its tiny package. For customers who don't want to sacrifice sophistication when they downsize -- and are willing to pay a substantial premium for it -- the new Hardtop 4-Door fits the bill. Then again, so does the one-class-up $21,515 five-door Volkswagen Golf, although that car lacks the design panache of the Mini. It does, however, also have a usable rear seat.", "After pounding the pavements of Glasgow it is hard to paint an objective view for readers as the country gears up to vote on its independence.\n\nIt's not my intrinsic desire to back the underdog and it isn't my upbringing in the Free State that has gotten in the way of impartiality.\n\nOn the streets of Glasgow the 'No' voters are nowhere to be seen.

He was 83.\n\nMr. Hegg built a Northern California empire during 31 years at the helm of Sacramento Savings. As chief executive officer, he grew the company's assets from $60 million in 1963 to more than $3 billion and expanded its reach among customers from three branch offices to 45 branches and 25 lending offices from Redding to Modesto.\n\nWith an industry reputation for intelligence and integrity, he stayed on as leader after Sacramento Savings was sold to Allegheny Corp. of New York in 1989. Sticking largely to the traditional S&L role of writing home mortgages and loaning to small businesses, he steered the company through the industry crisis that began in 1980s, when many thrift institutions made risky investments and failed following federal deregulation.\n\nUnder his leadership, Sacramento Savings financed about 200,000 family homes and provided thousands of jobs in the region, according to a 1994 story in The Sacramento Bee. After 120 years in business, the historic lending institution disappeared when it was sold in 1994 to First Interstate Bancorp (which later was acquired by Wells Fargo Bank), and Hegg served as chairman of Allegheny Properties until 2011.\n\n\"Bill was a very savvy businessman who surrounded himself with very good people and listened to all points of view before reaching a decision,\" said David Bugatto, president and chief executive officer of Allegheny Properties, a former Sacramento Savings officer. \"He was there to protect the assets of the bank, which was protecting the depositors.\"\n\nMr. Hegg was prominent in Sacramento as a civic leader and philanthropist. He served as a chairman, board director or member of many organizations, including UC Davis Cancer Center, Goodwill Industries, Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, Boy Scouts, KVIE and Children's Receiving Home of Sacramento.\n\nHe encouraged Sacramento Savings employees to volunteer and presented checks on behalf of the bank for scholarships, veterans, neighborhood projects and other community needs. He helped raise thousands of dollars for the United Cerebral Palsy Association, which named him 1994 humanitarian of the year.\n\n\"Bill gave more than dollars,\" said David Ballard, chief executive officer of Children's Receiving Home of Sacramento. \"He maintained a personal connection and cared deeply about the charities he gave to. He would come by and visit long after any donation. He was a supporter and a friend.\"\n\nWilliam Gavin Hegg was born in 1931 in Stevens Point, Wisc. He enrolled in ROTC and earned an accounting degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He served in the Army in Germany and was a corporate officer at a savings and loan in Wheaton, Ill., before moving to Sacramento in 1963.\n\nA top amateur golfer, Mr. Hegg won local charity tournaments and was a club champion and longtime member at North Ridge Country Club. He loved performance cars and attended a BMW racing school in North Carolina at 75.\n\n\"He came across as very proper, but he was quite a prankster who was always playing tricks on people,\" his daughter Rachael Lamkin said. \"I was usually his primary victim.\"\n\nIn addition to his daughter, Mr. Hegg is survived by a sister, Ann Thompson, and a brother, Jim.\n\nA celebration of his life is set for 1 p.m. Oct. 18 at North Ridge Country Club, 7600 Madison Ave., Fair Oaks.

(Mark Wilson / Getty Images)\n\nGoogle Inc., with its vision for a future where cars drive themselves, is putting itself at odds with an auto industry that shares its desire for safer, less-congested roads -- yet won't abide the \"driverless\" part.\n\nThe clash pits the Internet giant, public for barely a decade, against companies that spent a century building the machines that put people behind the wheel of autos. As Google works to perfect a system in research labs and road tests to minimize the involvement of drivers, automakers spend billions of dollars annually on ads to do the opposite. Think BMW and its claims to the Ultimate Driving Machine, or Volkswagen and its Drivers Wanted sales pitch.\n\nThe differences are more than philosophical.\n\nGoogle is sweeping up top talent and research, powered by an almost $400 billion stock-market value that tops those of Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. combined. It's also keeping a tight grip on its mapping data and potential marketing plans for cars while helping to create what many in the auto industry consider unrealistic expectations for how quickly cars can safely become wholly driverless.\n\n\"Clearly there's some sort of tension there,\" said Richard Wallace, director of transportation systems analysis at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Google's splashy displays of technology \"lead to expectations creep that's probably unrealistic in some ways,\" he said.\n\nGoogle's aloofness was on display at last week's Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit. The search giant had minimal presence at the annual event where automakers hash out standards for the technology that would keep, at the center of it all, the driver.\n\nAmong the advancements automakers announced at last week's conference in Detroit was GM's \"Super Cruise\" system for 2017 Cadillacs, which will let drivers take their hands off the steering wheel and feet from pedals for periods of highway driving. Like technology being developed by Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and other companies, GM's system hands control back and forth between driver and vehicle.\n\nThe approach that Google is taking is, literally, much more hands-off. In May it unveiled plans to deploy at least 100 fully autonomous, two-seat, egg-shaped test cars with a top speed of 25 miles per hour and no steering wheel. Google has since said it will include one, as well as brake and gas pedals, as California requires.\n\nAided by early staffing with top Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University scientists who won a U.S.-backed driverless vehicle challenge in 2005, Google recruited dozens of robotics and artificial-intelligence researchers, and is adding more.\n\nGoogle has won or applied for 96 autonomous-driving patents since 2011 and has hired talent from Toyota, BMW AG, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and even Silicon Valley upstart Tesla Motors Inc., according to LinkedIn profiles. For high-level advice, Google can turn to former Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally, now a board member.\n\nIt's also backed by more than $60 billion in cash, more than any individual automaker can muster.\n\n\"When you're at Google's scale you do plenty of things that disrupt or change the environment,\" said Frank Gillett, analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"We now have a race for who's going to build the software and services platform that operates driverless cars.\"\n\nWhile the effort is still in an early phase, executives including co-founder Sergey Brin have committed Google to making driverless cars a reality. They tout societal benefits of robotic cars, such as a transportation option for the blind and elderly.\n\nTo traditional manufacturers, anything that makes human drivers superfluous is automotive heresy.\n\n\"Driving is essentially very fun,\" Ken Koibuchi, general manager of intelligent vehicle development for Toyota, said in an interview in Detroit this month. For that and reasons including liability issues in the case of an accident and yet-to-be-set regulations, the world's largest carmaker isn't planning a driverless car even as it adds automated features.\n\nNissan Motor Co., Mercedes and Tesla are among those that have said they'll add self-driving features by end of the decade. None has said how much it's spending to do that.\n\n\"They've kind of shamed the automakers into investing more money into this,\" said Egil Juliussen, research director for advanced driving systems for IHS Automotive.\n\nWhile Google's cash pile tops that of individual automakers, Toyota's $41 billion, Volkswagen's $44 billion and GM's $29 billion ensure they can fund advances.\n\nGoogle so far hasn't specified whether it will build and sell driverless cars; create a service using such vehicles; or supply its driverless technology to the auto industry.", "A morbid and bizarre tale of love, abuse and death played out from Miami through the Florida Keys Tuesday, leaving family members reeling and police scurrying hundreds of miles to a crime scene.\n\nIn the end, Miami police found a body so badly decomposed they have not been able to determine if it is missing 28-year-old Tanya Gonzalez.\n\nSeveral hours later, they learned that the man they wanted to question about Gonzalez's disappearance stabbed himself to death with a steak knife after fleeing to the Florida Keys on a boat with his mother and their Siberian Husky.\n\nMonroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay said Roy Ruz Blanco died at Lower Keys Medical Center on Stock Island shortly after 4 p.m., not long after deputies chased him, his mother, Marta Blanco-Mendoza, and their dog, into the woods.\n\nAs they got close, Blanco's mom gobbled a handful of pills and Blanco stabbed himself in the stomach, Ramsay said.\n\n\"We pursued him. As soon as we grabbed him, he had his hands around his stomach and a steak knife in his belly,\" the sheriff said.\n\nBlanco's mother remained in the hospital Tuesday. The dog was handed over to the Society for the Prevention of Cruely to Animals, and Miami police were on their way to Stock Island.\n\n\"No one can even script a movie like this. It's crazy,\" said Miami Police Detective Frederica Burden.\n\nMiami police had been searching for Blanco since Monday, a day after the U.S. Coast Guard detained and questioned him following a wayward four-day boat ride aboard a catamaran with his mother and his dog. Police wanted to question Blanco about the disappearance of his former girlfriend Gonzalez, who has been missing since a Sept. 9 shopping spree with her aunt at Midtown Miami.\n\nOn Tuesday, a week after she disappeared, police found Gonzalez's blue, four-door BMW on the grassy curb of a residential Flagami neighborhood. Hours later, with dozens of family members, friends and residents gathered under the blistering sun behind yellow police tape, investigators in hazmat suits opened the trunk.\n\nInside was a body so badly decomposed that police said it will take until Wednesday to identify. Gonzalez's father, Ramon Gonzalez, who had flown down from New Jersey to search for his daughter, had no doubt this was his little girl.\n\n\"This is the worst nightmare for anybody, any human being,\" he told Miami Herald news partner CBS 4. \"I'm panicking. You don't know what to do. You don't know where to turn.\"\n\nTanya Gonzalez, who worked at the Mojito Bar at Bayside Marketplace in downtown Miami, had been the focus of a growing manhunt that had out-of-town relatives and private detectives offering help, and local police searching for Blanco, a former boyfriend who friends and family say abused her.\n\nOn Tuesday, the scene at first centered around Gonzalez's BMW, which sat on a grassy median for several days near the corner of Southwest Fourth Street and 62nd Avenue, area residents said. Several of the homes around the BMW had surveillance video that police will be looking at.\n\nAfter the car was found, police focused their attention on Blanco, the hulking 33-year-old, six-foot, four-inch, 200-plus-pound former boyfriend. The two had a five-year relationship that many close to Gonzalez said was abusive.\n\nFriends and family of Gonzalez who knew Blanco said she repeatedly told them she feared Blanco would harm her, and that she finally left him and moved into an Aventura apartment.\n\nBrahms Alexis, who worked with Gonzalez at the Mojito Bar, said he helped her move into her Aventura home in early August. He said Gonzalez told him two weeks ago that Blanco \"was getting physical with her, and that he had threatened to kill himself.\n\n\"She was afraid,\" Alexis said.\n\nRamon Gonzalez said his daughter repeatedly broke up with Blanco, but that \"she refused to press charges. We encouraged it.\"\n\nPolice began to focus squarely on Blanco on Monday, a day after a good Samaritan spotted the rental boat stranded and out of gas just off Big Coppitt Key, more than 100 miles from Miami and 11 miles from Key West.\n\nA Coast Guard report on the incident obtained by the Miami Herald explained how Blanco showed up at Dinner Key on Sept. 10 in a rented Dodge Challenger, and rented the vessel promising to go no farther than Haulover Beach in Northeast Miami-Dade. When the boat wasn't returned later that evening, the vessel operators called the Coast Guard.\n\nA helicopter was launched and vessels were sent searching for the 25-foot catamaran carrying Blanco, his mother and their dog, according to the report. But the search was well before police had identified Blanco as someone with possible information on Gonzalez's whereabouts.\n\nOn Sunday, the report showed, the good Samaritan spotted the vessel off Big Coppitt, and towed it in. The Coast Guard questioned Blanco and determined he had not been smuggling undocumented immigrants. Unable to \"convict him of any crime based off evidence,\" the case was closed and Blanco was issued a warning and let go.\n\nWhen word reached Miami police, the search intensified in the Keys. Ramsay said a BOLO -- a Be On The Lookout order -- was sent to all sheriff's deputies and that fliers were handed out to local businesses.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon a business owner spotted Blanco and called the sheriff's office.\n\nDeputies tracked him, his mom and the dog into woods, where authorities said the Blancos gobbled a large quantity of unknown pills before deputies caught up to them. After Blanco stabbed himself, Monroe sheriff's deputies tried to take him to the hospital by helicopter. But he was in such bad shape, Ramsay said, they ended up transporting him on the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Miami, Gonzalez's car was towed to police headquarters where investigators could get a better look at it. The body found in the trunk is at the medical examiner's office, with doctors searching for any markings that could help identify the remains.\n\n\"We have to wait for the medical examiner,\" said Burden, the Miami detective. \"It looks like a murder-suicide.

The video, was uploaded to YouTube a few hours ago and is fast gaining popularity. It is unclear as to where the location of these incidents are. However, as per The Metro, the events depicted in this video come from Macedonia. This however is yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe video clip shows first person views of various people throwing garbage around the town getting instant justice at the hands of the \"litter warrior\" biker girl. The lady who seems to be patrolling the entire town is looking for people who lack basic civic sense.\n\nThe video starts off by showing the biker girl sitting on her parked bike on a sidewalk. The helmet mounted camera captures a woman inside a BMW throwing her cigarette butt on to the sidewalk. Acting fast, the biker girl approaches the car and throws in an entire ashtray filled with used cigarette butts into the car as the person sitting inside the vehicle protests.\n\nNext up, the biker woman and her helmet cam witnesses someone throwing an empty plastic bottle on to the streets of a cross walk. She takes the bottle, rushes towards the car and tapes the bottle on the side view mirror of the car.\n\nIn the last clip, the biker girl is seen making her way out of a McDonald's. That's when she witnesses a jerk throwing away his unwanted drink - with the McDonald's paper bag - on the parking lot. She gathers the thrown drink, rushes towards the vehicle and throws it right in. Serves him right!\n\nAt this moment, it is unclear of the footage is real or all this is part of a grand anti-litter campaign that is being used to raise awareness. Many people think it is the latter. After all, it is not every day that you frequently come across people littering all around town - and get to tape it as well. People who think this is real stuff argue that the videos could have been shot over long periods of time and edited together in this compilation.\n\nNevertheless, the video does get the message across and there certainly are people out there who deserve this kind of instant karma from the biker girl\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n[Image Via YouTube Screengrab]", "Police say armed thieves hit two jewelry stores in Queens over the last month.\n\nPolice are on the hunt for a group of Queens thieves with eyes for gold.\n\nMembers of the crew have been a part of two attempted armed robberies of jewelry stores in the last month, cops said.\n\nAccording to investigators, a man stormed into a Glendale jeweler on Aug. 16 and pistol whipped a 64-year-old man at the store before fleeing.\n\nOn Sept. 5, the man entered another store with two accomplices, one of whom fired a round into the floor, before they cleaned the place out.\n\nThe bandits made off with $26,000 worth of jewelry, including a heavy gold bracelet, police said.\n\nPolice released a video they say shows the crooks, who reportedly fled in a fancy BMW.\n\nResidents with tips should call (800) 577-8477.\n\nerosenberg@nydailynews.com\n\nRelated Stories Jailed-for-life cop killer still has hero's bullet in his shoulder Thief steals up to $1M in goods from 'America's largest closet'", "Increased diversity for the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer.\n\nMunich. Just over a month after its market launch, BMW has expanded the range of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer with the addition of three new engines and the intelligent all-wheel drive system BMW xDrive. As of November 2014 there will be two further diesel engines with three and four cylinders respectively as well as an additional 4-cylinder petrol engine for top-class performance figures and exemplary fuel consumption. All the power units in the new family of engines draw on the latest version of TwinPower Turbo Technology, thereby setting the benchmark in terms of power and efficiency. Meanwhile the intelligent all-wheel drive system BMW xDrive now demonstrates its supreme qualities on board the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, too.\n\nEconomical entry-level diesel, high-revving 2-litre engines.\n\nThe 2.0-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine in the BMW 220i Active Tourer (combined fuel consumption: 6.1-5.9 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 142-137 g/km)* delivers a peak output of 141 kW/192 bhp at 4,700 rpm and a maximum torque of 280 Nm at 1,250 rpm. This makes for athletic performance figures: the BMW 220i takes 7.5 seconds for the sprint from zero to 100 km/h, while its top speed is 230 km/h. The high-torque 4-cylinder diesel engine in the BMW 220d Active Tourer is no less dynamic and even more economical (combined fuel consumption: 4.5-4.4 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 119-115 g/km)*. The 2.0-litre power unit with a peak output of 140 kW/190 bhp at 4,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 400 Nm at 1,750 rpm is the top-of-the-range Active Tourer diesel. Finally, a new efficiency benchmark is set by the first 3-cylinder diesel in the BMW 216d Active Tourer: it has an average fuel consumption of 3.9-3.8 l/100 km* with CO2 emissions of 104-99 g/km*. This compact diesel has a capacity of 1.5 litres and an output of 85 kW/116 bhp at 4,000 rpm, putting a torque of 270 Nm on stream at just 1,750 rpm. As a result, the BMW 216d Active Tourer is able to reach speeds of up to 195 km/h and accelerate from standing to 100 km/h in 10.6 seconds. In this way, BMW once again demonstrates its expertise in the field of diesel technology.\n\nThe new engines can be combined with 6-speed manual transmission as standard or optionally with an automatic 8-speed Steptronic transmission (6-speed manual transmission only for the 216d).\n\nWith xDrive too: BMW 225i and 220d Active Tourer.\n\nBMW xDrive will be available for the two top engine variants of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer in future as well. The intelligent all-wheel drive system not only optimises traction and ride stability in all road and weather conditions, it also enhances the car's dynamic performance on corners. All-wheel drive comes as standard with the 8-speed Steptronic transmission both in the BMW 220d xDrive Active Tourer (combined fuel consumption: 4.8-4.6 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 127-122 g/km)* and the BMW 225i xDrive Active Tourer (combined fuel consumption: 6.5-6.4 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 152-148 g/km)*. Both models set new benchmarks in the segment in terms of efficiency and dynamic performance.\n\nWith six engines (three petrol and three diesel), along with a choice of manual or Steptronic transmission and BMW xDrive, there will a total of 12 variants available as of November. This diverse range gives the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a leading position within its class when it comes to efficiency and athletic flair.\n\n* Fuel consumption figures were calculated based on the ECE test cycle, dependent on tyre format.", "Saqib Hussain was captured on video plowing into a Ford Fiesta, going 70 mph in a 30 mph zone.

Each one features a confident woman at the center and tells a story of how liberating it is when you are being your most authentic self. We believe everyone who watches them will identify with one or more of the characters. We were thrilled to work with David Fincher, one of the greats of modern American cinema and a superb storyteller. His highly detailed and authentic style resonates with the Gap brand and these films truly bring to life what our 'Dress Normal' message means.\"\n\n\"In the fashion world, there's a trend and a conversation around this idea that's called normcore,' I'm sort of edified in a way to see that there's a fashion trend that is more extreme but recognizes this same truth.

Ramsay said no charges have been filed against Blanco and Miami police are on their way to Stock Island to question him. Miami police wanted to speak with Blanco about Gonzalez's disappearance. She has been missing since Sept. 9, after going shopping with her aunt and not showing up for work later that evening. On Tuesday, police discovered her blue BMW in a residential Flagami neighborhood in Miami. There was a body in the trunk, but it was too decomposed to make an identification. Miami police said they should be able to confirm the identity by Wednesday.", "Mercedes-Benz' C-Class used to be the cheapest way into a car with the Three Pointed Star. But with the swoopy 2014 CLA-Class now charged with capturing entry-lux buyers, the C-Class is now free to move upscale and zero in entirely on the BMW 3-Series and Audi A4. And for 2015, boy has it! What you're looking here at is nothing less than a 5/6 scale S-Class for half the price. We \"C\" a bona fide luxury car bargain.\n\nHere in America, Mercedes-Benz is not known for building cheap cars. It builds luxury cars. Big, solid, and expensive luxury cars. Given that, when a company like Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac or others build smaller, less expensive offerings, one should question what compromises might have been made to build the cheaper cars. Do they embody the company's core values only in a smaller package, or are they pawning something that, by virtue of its price point, is not as well built, markedly less comfortable, and contains less of the good stuff?\n\nWe're happy to report that, in the case of the 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, you're getting a bona fide Benz. It is such a leap from the previous iterations of the C-Class that they might as well have named it something else. Like S-Class lite. Or S/C-Class. Or S-Class \"Kompact.\"\n\nYou get the point: this car is a lot more like the new S-Class super-sedan than the outgoing C-Class, and considering how much technology, safety, and swagger the new S-Class contains, that's really saying something. Mercedes-Benz brought us out to Seattle, Washington, to get our first taste of the C-Class from the driver's seat.\n\nThe first example we drove was the C300, which is powered by a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that has been turbocharged to the tune of 241-horsepower and 272 lb.-ft. of torque. We found it to be adequate, if not terribly stimulating from an acceleration standpoint. When pushed, it still sounds like a four-cylinder, though off the gas, it's as silent as a sleeping cat.\n\nPrevious Next Enlarge\n\nFor the friskier drivers, Mercedes offers the C400, which swaps in a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that produces a very healthy 329-hp and 354 lb.-ft. of torque, which is way up from the 302-hp and 273 lb.-ft. of torque made by the non-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 in the 2014 C350. So equipped, the C-Class transforms into the kind of effortlessly swift and stable sport sedan one associates with a German pedigree.\n\nThe seven-speed automatic transmission, standard with both engines, is also a willing partner, with four operating modes: Eco, Comfort, Sport and Sport+. These are selectable via a button marked \"Agility\" on the center console. In Eco, the transmission shifts at low rpms into the highest possible gear to save gas. Mash the throttle in Sport or Sport+, however, and the gearbox cracks off quick (if somewhat abrupt) shifts at higher rpms, particularly in the C400. Comfort mode is an excellent compromise, we feel, for most drivers, but enthusiasts will probably favor Sport mode. All-wheel-drive is also available on the C300 and standard on the gutsy C400, so this car will be more than ready to take on a New York winter - or anywhere else susceptible to fickle polar vortexes.\n\nDynamically, the C-Class once again mimics the S-Class in its comfort-seeking inclinations. The ride is Euro-taut but isolated from harsh bumps with the standard suspension. The $1,190 optional Airmatic suspension (which uses air springs instead of coil springs) takes the ride to near-limousine smoothness, yet keeps the car completely level in high-speed corners, lowers the car at speed for better stability, and prevents dive during braking and rear-end squat when accelerating. The steering feels direct and predictable in corners, with decent feedback and a solid on-center feel for easy lane-keeping at high speeds -- this is an Autobahn-bred car, after all -- though an electronic lane-keeping assist feature is available in the event you put a tire over the line.\n\nPrevious Next Enlarge\n\nAll of the above systems, save for the non-Airmatic suspension, are also connected to the \"Agility Select\" settings. In addition to the aforementioned Eco, Comfort, Sport and Sport+ modes, this also includes an \"Individual\" mode that allows one to tailor each aspect individually. For example, if you want to drive in Eco mode, but want more weight to the steering and a firm ride, you can do that. Or you can drive with sportier throttle and transmission response, but keep the ride super-smooth and steering effort light. All told, it drives like a Benz. Not as sporty as a BMW or a Cadillac, but a Benz.\n\nNow, while the car still doesn't quite match its archrival, the BMW 3-Series, in sportiness or cool factor, it does out-class the BMW -- and virtually all of its other competitors -- inside. For many luxury brand buyers, it's the interior spoils that count most, and boy does the C-Class ladle on the spoils. As with the exterior, the interior mimics the S-Class in its use of subtle, sweeping contours, indirect lighting, and classy silver buttons and knobs. Numerous wood and leather treatments are available, including a stunning, open-pore black ash wood that looks dressier than the wood in many cars twice its price.\n\nThe C-Class features Mercedes' latest version of its COMAND interface, which not only features a round controller in front of the armrest, but also uses a remote touchpad with haptic feedback. While we wouldn't say that the system is completely intuitive, it is learnable within a day or so (at least that was our experience). In any case, we advise spending some quality time to learn COMAND's various features and functions, especially if the car is upgraded with the $2,690 Multimedia package. This brings an 8.4-inch screen, 3D maps, navigation, and various music and media storage options.\n\nPrevious Next Enlarge\n\nThe C-Class starts at $39,325, which includes power front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless ignition, automatic headlamps, seven-inch COMAND display screen, a power steering column, rain-sensing wipers, power folding mirrors, leatherette upholstery, aluminum trim, autonomous braking, and seven airbags, including a driver knee airbag. Most options come in bundles, including the aforementioned Multimedia package; the $2,300 Interior package (leather upholstery, ventilated seats, ambient lighting and more); the $2,700 Premium package (heated front seats, SiriusXM satellite radio, Burmester speakers, LED headlamps); the $650 Luxury package (comfort suspension, unique grille with stand-up hood ornament, burl wood trim and leatherette-wrapped dashboard); the $2,800 Driver Assistance package (radar cruise control, blind spot and lane-keeping assist, rear-end collision protection, cross-traffic alert); and the $2,500 Sport Package (sport suspension, sport seats, flat-bottom steering wheel, performance brakes, unique wheels). Oh yeah, and add $2K for all-wheel drive on the C300 4Matic.\n\nStep up to the C400 4Matic for $49,515 (after destination charge), and you'll get the powerful V-6, all-wheel drive, bigger brakes, and all Premium and Sport package contents.\n\nRegardless of which you choose, the new C-Class comes wrapped in a package that, from 20 paces, casts the same visual impression as the $95K S-Class. It has the same head- and taillamp treatment, tastefully scalloped body sides, arching roofline and sloping tail, all of which looks none the worse for having lost 22 inches in overall length.\n\nIndeed, the 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class is Germanic elegance, wrapped in a compact package. And every inch of it feels like pure Mercedes-Benz.\n\nBase Specs: 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class MSRP:$39,325 (C300); $40,400 (C300 4MATIC); $48,590 (C400 4MATIC) Engine:2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder (C300); 3.0-liter turbocharged V-6 (C400) Power:241-hp, 272 lb.-ft.

His areas of oversight will include sales and dealer network development, product planning, and marketing. He'll even have \"critical input\" on engineering and design. One of de Nysschen's primary objectives is to grow Cadillac in China, with a goal of doubling sales in 2015 to around 100,000 vehicles.\n\nAccording to Automotive News, de Nysschen intends to remain at Cadillac for the balance of his career.

Handmade isn't what it used to be, but is that such a bad thing?\n\nRandy Ema returns a quizzical look. He's arguably the world's most recognized authority on Duesenbergs, like the 1930 Murphy-bodied Model SJ roadster in which we're both sitting. I've asked him to meet me and the Duesy on the rooftop of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles in order to fill the gaps in my knowledge of the marque.\n\nEma's well-known for his willingness to help the average Joes on Duesenberg fan forums with everything from major technical issues to the identification of cars in random vintage photographs. Still, his time is worth real money, as evidenced by the seven-figure prices for vehicles he's restored, and I get the distinct feeling I'm wasting some of it. So I clarify.\n\n\"It looks like straight-grain walnut, something I used to buy for my projects in wood shop. Compare it with that.\" And I wave at the 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith coupe parked next to us, its reverse-hinged door open and displaying an improbable swath of Canadel wood paneling, chevron book-matched and intensely figured.\n\nEma looks at the Wraith, then back to me. His eyes crinkle. \"That's wooden door trim. This,\" he says, pointing where I'm resting my left arm, \"is a wooden door.\" Then he explains: When the Walter M. Murphy Co. built the body for this particular Duesenberg chassis, it made the doors by forming them in solid wood and then beating the door skins to fit over the wood. It's metal trim on a wooden door. And since wood is more pleasant to touch than metal, the inside of the door is trimmed in mahogany where an arm might come in contact with it.\n\nIt's a simple idea, but executing it properly required hundreds of hours of work, most of it by master craftsmen whose jobs differed from car to car and day to day. Henry Ford's assembly line had been turning out mass-produced flivvers for a decade and half by the time the Duesenberg Model J appeared in 1928, but there was no assembly line at Murphy, nor was one desired. After all, the owners weren't just buying a product. They were buying time.\n\nTime, lavished by the hour on the creation of the racing-inspired Duesenberg chassis. Time, in the painstaking construction of the engine, five or even ten times as powerful as those with which it shared the road, built to such a standard that even today most Duesys are known by their engine numbers, the core powerplant that has survived 80 or 90 years. The engine of a Duesenberg is its heart, but the individually made coachwork around it holds the car's soul.\n\nThe value of a Duesenberg was partly its staggering performance and partly its undeniable beauty, but primarily its cost to build, which reflected time. To drive one was to announce that your time was so valuable, a small portion of it could purchase a much greater amount of someone else's -- that through talent or capital or inheritance, you could sport around in an automobile whose birth required dozens of men to hammer and shape and sand and trim and paint.\n\nAs Ema shows me the intricacies of this particular Murphy SJ, time comes up again and again. Start with this: The car was originally completely different, with a body coachbuilt as a sedan by Judkins and the standard normally aspirated engine. Another owner cast aside the first body, along with the hundreds of hours it represented, and had Murphy provide a new one. Then the engine was supercharged to Duesenberg's SJ specification, which enabled it to reach around 135 mph in an era when a standard Ford was pressed to do 65. Straight-eight, twin-cam, four valves per cylinder, over six and three-quarter liters of displacement. More of a racing engine than a street one, with all the effort that implies, in both construction and maintenance.\n\nLook at the decorative engine-turned surface of the dashboard: thousands of individually applied swirls, each as distinct as a fingerprint. The evidence of human effort is everywhere. In the stitching of the close-coupled but surprisingly comfortable seats. In the remarkably complete set of gauges and controls, each of which needs its own wiring and plumbing. Even the knob to adjust brake pressure, a sort of Paleolithic anti-lock brake system, has the solidity and heft of an heirloom.\n\nThe man or woman who drove something like this 80 years ago could be assured that there was nothing better available. Yet, as Ema himself volunteers, \"Rolls-Royce really showed us how it was done.\" In 1921, Rolls embarked upon the adventure of American production, in Springfield, Massachusetts, two decades before the firm moved to its iconic Crewe location in England and eight decades before the current greenfield site at Goodwood was conceived. Many of these \"Springfield Silver Ghosts\" featured coachwork from American firm Brewster & Co., and Ema suggests that the standards imposed on Brewster by the British directly inspired the peerless efforts from Murphy and others in the decade that followed. It was something, to have a Brewster-bodied Rolls-Royce.\n\nRolls-Royce later abandoned the coachbuilders and focused on what were called standard steel saloons, like the Silver Cloud. In 1965, when the unit-body Silver Shadow arrived to bring the company into the modern era, the coupe version was briefly offered in both an in-house Mulliner Park Ward variant and a coachbuilt James Young model. When the latter was discontinued after just 35 examples, the MPW Silver Shadow became the Corniche. Its direct descendant, with a few twists and turns in the corporate history, is the new-for-2014 Wraith.\n\nIt's a supreme irony, really; for the first half of the company's lifetime, most of its cars were supplied as rolling chassis to coachbuilders. Yet with the Wraith, Rolls-Royce is primarily responsible for the body, not what lies beneath. This is a short-wheelbase variant of the Ghost sedan, which is itself based on the BMW 7-series. The 624-hp twin-turbo V-12, the most powerful regular-production powerplant in Rolls history, is based on the BMW N74 V-12. The eight-speed transmission is BMW's, as are much of the car's electronics.\n\nGiven this starting point, the men from Goodwood have drawn a stunning coupe body. Style takes precedent ahead of aerodynamics or space efficiency. The familiar Pantheon grille is subdued, set into the bodywork, and tilted back. Although no Rolls-Royce has ever looked like this, no one who confronts the Wraith in the metal fails to understand what it is. It's not as oversized as Rolls's more expensive Phantom Coupe, but it towers over family sedans and offers the driver something like an SUV's perspective on traffic.\n\nThe Wraith's door is the opposite of that in the Duesenberg. It starts with a computer-designed frame, engineered over a thousand or more computational iterations to maximize side-impact strength while minimizing weight and unwanted resonance. Then, the perfectly fitted trim, made by machines in supplier factories, is added. Finally, leather and wood are applied. Thin veneers are selected and applied largely by hand, but the element that is \"hand-builtin Goodwood, England,\" as the sill plate says, is simply a decoration, wood trim on a metal core, a spicing-up. Should you be lucky enough to own a pair of Wraiths, you could exchange their doors using standard tools.\n\nYet there's an undeniable sense of occasion here: in the operation of the massive chrome door handle, the surprisingly natural and easy step into the reverse-hinged door opening, the settling into the superb but relatively small driver's seat. Pressing and holding a button closes the door with a solid thump. The engine subtly vibrates the cabin in such a manner as to remind the occupants that this is the sporting Rolls-Royce.\n\nA coachbuilder can only do so much to mask the machine beneath, so it's no surprise that the climate-control vents, infotainment screen location, and general proportions of the interior are similar to that of the BMW donor platform. The changes around the driver tend to favor simplification. In the 7-series, there are multiple buttons beneath a wide and complex LCD; in the Wraith, there are a pair of rotary controls and two thumbwheels. After all, the imagined customer for a 7-series is a take-no-prisoners tech-firm tyrant. He'd take pride in being able to precisely set the climate control, particularly if it required a degree of technical mastery. He'd also like the vaguely manual-shift-looking console gear selector that says \"sporty\" to anybody peering in the window.\n\nThe imagined customer for a Wraith, on the other hand, is a titled English gentleman who assumes that the mechanicals beneath him are of the highest quality and wishes to be untroubled by the details. The column shifter pleases him, because it stays out of the way and also because Rolls-Royces have had fingertip-pressure column shifters since the Eighties. His father's Spur and his grandfather's Shadow had them, so why not here? He couldn't possibly be bothered to learn anything about cars beyond what he was taught in boarding school, but he expects that his personal vehicle will be exceptional in every way.\n\nIn that latter respect, the Wraith could not satisfy more. The twin-blown twelve offers the inexorable force of a locomotive, transmitted to the rear wheels with the alacrity of a superbike. There is simply no competition for this combination of brute power and cultured delivery, this kind of shove, or the electronic wit to remain level, even when deliberately launched from 3000 rpm against the brake pedal -- nothing else moves with this sort of aristocratic indifference.\n\nIn providing this big-hearted engine and massively puissant drivetrain, Munich is effectively filling the role that was once held by Rolls-Royce itself, leaving the latter to serve as a sort of coachbuilder. It is now Brewster or Murphy, producing a beautiful body to complement world-class mechanicals. Marketing materials for the Wraith emphasize the vast palette of customizations, colors, and materials, options that can run into six figures all by themselves.\n\nYou'd like to think that every customer with the prudence to deserve this car will spend the $12,925 on the optional Starlight headliner. Twinkling with the adjustable glow of hundreds of fiber-optic ends, it makes every evening trip in the Wraith a little magical. It's the equivalent of Murphy's famous disappearing top, an expensive accoutrement that adds something indefinable to the experience. Precisely what you should get from a car whose sticker price would procure at least three of the big BMW sedans with which the Wraith shares so much.\n\nIn that light, it's best to think of the Wraith as a coachbuilt automobile, the direct descendant of the Brewster Rolls-Royces and a cousin to the Murphy-bodied Duesenberg. Each has bespoke instrumentation. The \"power reserve\" indicator in the Wraith that serves in place of a tachometer is the sort of ridiculous affectation that would be at home among the other whimsical gauges on the older car's dash: brake lining remaining, service lights, an altimeter.\n\nNeither the SJ nor the Wraith care much for interior volume, although when I offer Ema a ride in the back seat of the Rolls, he's impressed at the available space. When he slips behind the thin-rimmed steering wheel, he's charmed by the effortless power and maneuverability. He notes that, as with Duesenbergs in their day, the Wraith is far more powerful and stable than the machinery surrounding it on the road. As a gearhead, Ema prefers hot rods. Yet he admits that, in motion, the Wraith is true to every convention of the sporting luxury car.\n\nToward that end, I return Ema to the Petersen museum and take a distaff companion in his stead to West Hollywood's famous Tower Bar. Built from the shell of gangster Bugsy Siegel's apartment on the ground floor of the Sunset Tower Hotel, the bar is old-school Hollywood personified. When we arrive at the front door, the valet immediately recognizes the Rolls, although to my knowledge, our test car is one of the first to have the run of Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Wraith!\" he gushes. \"The fastest Rolls-Royce ever!\" Then he accepts a generous tip to drive it just 20 feet backward into the premier spot, next to a Bentley Mulsanne and a Ghost, as my companion and I are lent a sort of reflected glamour.\n\nWhen we later return to the valet stand, the owner of the Mulsanne is gushing. \"I have to have one,\" he fumes. \"How did you get one before everybody else? I'm going to make a call.\" At no point does he inquire as to cost or the mechanics of the Wraith's availability. If you have to ask, you can't afford to be the second man in Hollywood with a twin-turbo fastback Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe high-net-worth buyers of the West Coast didn't need to be told about this car. They know it; they want it -- the same way that Clark Gable wanted his Duesenberg JN for the seduction of Carole Lombard. That, too, was a rebody, Gable choosing Murphy's Pasadena neighbors, Bohman & Schwartz, for a chassis that originally supported a Rollston body.\n\nSuch a thing would be effectively impossible today. Though the Wraith is coachbuilt in a way, in reality, it's a tightly constructed piece that would cost millions of dollars to modify in any manner that attempted to retain the functionality of the original. You might as well try to duplicate Clark Gable himself from a vegan leading man of the 21st century.\n\nAs a palliative for that disturbing enforced similarity, the knowledge that your neighbor's Wraith mirrors your own, Rolls-Royce offers some of the coachbuilder's magic. The marketing materials speak in time-honored style: \"The spacious four-seat interior has been hand-built by skilled craftspeople and technicians.\" But hand-built how? Not in the Murphy way. Not in the old way.\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss the Wraith as false, as an imitation of the Duesenberg. But to do so would be to ignore both the realities of modern life and the significant advantages of the Rolls's construction. A Wraith built by hand in the Murphy style couldn't offer a tenth of what it does as a mass-produced automobile. The electronics, the inhuman tolerances of the drivetrain, the way it absorbs potholes as if milled from a single billet: These are the fruit of the machine. And we wouldn't have it any other way. Who would want a car with hand-sewn airbags? The old coachbuilders strove for perfection, but today we know such a thing is only possible when a robot is on the job.\n\nBut the one-percenters who walk among us still demand their tribute of time, and Rolls-Royce dutifully provides it in descriptions of book-matched interior veneer and hand-built engines that could just as easily have been hand-built from entirely different batches of parts. These filigrees likely require more time than the ground-up assembly of a new Toyota Camry or Honda Accord, and they give Wraith buyers the sense that they've acquired something outside common experience.\n\nIt's best, therefore, to think of this Rolls-Royce as a spiritual successor to the Duesenbergs. Not because of the way it is made, but because of why. It's meant to be the best. Eighty years ago, that required a man with a steady hammer and an eye for the hand-formed line. Today, it requires a near-infinite capacity for computer-aided-design iteration cycles and a strong relationship with a supplier network. The Duesenberg brothers, I think, would drive this big-hearted coupe and approve. The wooden door trim might be a fa\u00e7ade, but the Wraith's excellence is very real.", "Q: We love our son's new Mercedes CLA, especially the smallish size. We'd like a small premium vehicle, but we don't wish to do business with our local Mercedes dealer because of a history. Are there other comparable vehicles, from a size and luxury perspective? A: You might check out the Audi A3 and S3, and BMW's M235i. Each is luxury in a small (fuel-efficient) package. Q: We've got eight grandchildren, from ages 2 to 8, and they visit often. We're extremely careful, of course, but wonder, as we consider car-buying options, if it's worth the extra expense to get a rear-view camera. A:\n\nI'm glad you're so careful. And I would hope that caution would continue even if you get a car equipped with a rear camera, as I regard the backup camera as supplemental to extreme diligence, not an excuse to drop the watchfulness.\n\nThere's some evidence that having such cameras can prevent accidents of the sort that concern you. A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that rear cameras work better than parking sensors at preventing drivers from backing over kids or hitting objects. The test used a foam dummy, not real children, which is definitely worth noting.\n\nAlso worth saying: although drivers with review cameras had fewer collisions, they hit the dummy or other object 56 percent of the time. Yup. Technology helps. Caution is imperative. Q: Would you ever consider letting your insurance company install one of those data-collection device on your car for the slim chance of getting a rate discount? A:\n\nYes. I'm a low-mileage driver, rarely speed, rarely have to slam on my brakes hard and never drive in the late night or wee hours (the higher risk times). And I like saving money.\n\nAt this point, insurance companies are saying that whatever they discover from these devices, your insurance rates won't go up. But many consumers worry that even if that's true today, it won't be tomorrow. I understand that. But with my driving habits, I think there's no way for whatever information is collected to bite me in the backside. Not all people, of course, are quite that confident about how others might assess their driving! And some don't want to sacrifice any privacy.\n\n\u00a9 CTW Features", "My neighbors stared at it, puzzled. With its low stance, its short-sided tires with black-painted wheels and that matte gray paint this car looked mean. Angry, almost. But it was a station wagon.\n\nStation wagons aren't supposed to be angry. They're supposed to take kids to soccer practice, pick up some groceries. Maybe they can get boxes of easy-to-assemble furniture at Ikea once in a while. There's room for a lot in a station wagon but there's no room for aggression.\n\nBut engineers at Mercedes-Benz's AMG performance division managed to squeeze some in. A lot, actually.\n\nIt's got a 577 horsepower turbocharged V8 engine and full-time all-wheel-drive. That's enough power and traction to blast this thing from a dead stop to 60 miles an hour in about 3.5 seconds.\n\nThe front sports seats have adjustable active side bolsters that can hold you in tightly or loosely depending on your preference and your waist measurements. In hard turns they push in from whichever side centrifugal force is pulling you towards. Of course, that only invites you take those turns faster and faster until the novelty of those helpfully pressing side bolsters begins to wear off.\n\nRelated - Introducing the entry-level Lamborghini\n\nBut the excitement of being in a viciously fast station wagon that corners as nicely as this one really never does go away. Honestly, this may be the most fun I've ever had in any four-door Mercedes AMG car.\n\nOther AMG models I've driven have tended to feel strong but a little clumsy. They've tended to lack the agile feel and refinement of BMW's competing M cars feeling more brutish, like high-end luxury muscle cars.\n\nThe E63 wagon, oddly, felt like a really good sports sedan. I credit part of it -- and this is just a guess, on my part -- to the extra weight hanging around the back end which would help to counter the extra-heavy engine up front.\n\nI also credit part of it to the fact that, for crying out loud, it's a station wagon. You just don't expect a wagon to move like this thing does. It's fast, has good suspension in any of its various settings (from super comfortable to firm and sporty) and, of course, there are a host of technology options.\n\nWith a total price tag of $117,000 -- starting price is $102,000 -- the AMG E63 wagon could pretty much drive itself if I were inclined to let it.

Fortunately though, there is already a great (and safer) way to invest in the boom in China's Internet economy: search engine Baidu (BIDU, Tech30), which is essentially the Google (GOOGL, Tech30) of China.\n\nBaidu has been publicly traded in the U.S. since 2005. The stock has surged 1,600% from its first day closing price! It has done better than Apple, Google and Amazon in the past nine years.\n\nThe company reported ridiculously strong growth for the second quarter back in July. Sales were up 58.5% from a year ago. Earnings rose 34%.\n\nLike Google, Facebook (FB, Tech30), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and other companies that depend largely on advertising, Baidu has also done a great job of building up its mobile presence. Revenue from mobile now accounts for 30% of total sales.\n\nAnd the best news for investors is that Baidu's stock is still reasonably valued. Even though one share costs more than $200, Baidu trades at about 24 times 2015 earnings forecasts. That's not dirt cheap but it doesn't conjure up bad memories of the 2000 dot-com bubble either.\n\nThis is not to say that Alibaba is going to be a dud. And there are also some big challenges facing Baidu as well.\n\nWill Baidu ever be able to expand outside of China in a major way? Currently, its only non-China business is a Baidu-branded search engine in Japan.\n\nIt's also fair to wonder how successful Baidu might be outside of China since it really has the market there all to itself once Google pretty much gave up on the search market in China in 2010 due to censorship concerns.\n\nRelated: Alibaba is actually a lot different than Amazon\n\nSpeaking of Google, it looks like Baidu is also trying to make a name for itself with driverless cars. Baidu just announced a research partnership with BMW to develop tech for semi-autonomous vehicles. Baidu also has developed a wearable device called Baidu Eye, which is very similar to Google Glass.\n\nSo is Baidu stretching itself too thin by trying to be too much like Google? Possibly.\n\nBut Baidu, much like Google, has performed well enough to deserve some benefit of the doubt.\n\nInvestors should remember that too.

The 2+2 convertible was designed independently of the 2 Series Coupe but offers similar dynamic virtues, BMWsays, thanks to its rear-wheel drive layout -- unique in the segment -- and stiffer construction. The powered soft-top operates in 20 seconds at speeds up to 50km/h and the car is bigger than the model it replaces, the 1 Series Convertible. The 2 Series, which extends BMW's renumbering strategy into its smallest cars, arrived here in February.\n\nWHAT is it about pinot noir that sends people into a frenzy?

Scientists believe that exposure to germs contained in animal skin and fur could prime the immune system not to trigger allergies. The research, presented at last week's European Respiratory Society international congress in Munich, follows studies that suggested that being exposed to a wider range of environments from a young age could protect against asthma, though it had not been clear if this was true in urban settings. The researchers used data from about 2500 city-dwelling German children, 55 per cent of whom slept on animal skin in their first three months after birth. The chance of having asthma at the age of six was 79 per cent lower in those who had slept on animal skin. The results lend support to the \"hygiene hypothesis\" that suggests too much cleanliness early in life can increase susceptibility to allergies. Researcher Christina Tischer says: \"An animal skin might be a reservoir for various kinds of microbes ... Our findings confirmed that it is crucial to study further the microbial environment within the animal fur.\"", "Add Mercedes-Benz to Hollywood's favorite luxury car makers adding a plug-in hybrid version of a flagship model.\n\nThe S-500 Plug-In Hybrid, which goes on sale in spring 2015, pairs a 328 horsepower 3.0 liter turbocharged V6 gasoline engine with a 107 hp electric motor. The car can travel 20 miles on electricity alone before the gasoline engine engages. Mercedes claims the S-500 delivers the performance of a V8 engine with the fuel consumption of a much smaller car. Europe's version of the EPA. which hasn't yet released mileage estimates, rates the car at a combined 84 mpg.\n\nWhile Mercedes earlier this year fielded a $39,000 pure-electric version of its B-Class, a gasoline-powered hatchback sold outside the U.S., the S-Class sedans are Mercedes' flagships--the carmaker invested more than $1 billion revamping the model for 2014--and start at $95,000 (the new S500 is expected to be similarly priced.)\n\nCredit Tesla's Model S, the third most popular luxury vehicle, gas or electric, sold in California last year, with providing the impetus for Mercedes, Porsche and BMW to get serious about the market for electric vehicles.\n\nThe Panamera S E-hybrid, launched in 2013, was the first premium-class plug-in from traditional automaker.

The pick of the bunch is clearly the M235i, which sports a turbocharged straight-six engine good for 320 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque.\n\nOf course, it's the priciest, too, with the starting price set to fall a couple of grand above the $44,050 sticker of the M235i coupe. The good news is that for a lot less money you can still get the look of the M235i by equipping the regular 228i variants of the 2-Series Convertible with the car's available M Sport package.\n\nThat package includes a full body kit with more aggressive intakes in the front bumper, sporty side sills and a rear diffuser. It also includes uprated suspension, high-gloss chrome exhaust tips and 17-inch light alloy wheels with a unique BMW M design.\n\nThe M Sport package for the 2-Series Convertible also adds a few touches to the interior, which include a hexagonal pattern for the seat trim, Estoril Blue accents for the stitching and dash elements, and an ambient lighting package. There are also several M-badged goodies such as the door sill treadplates, steering wheel and gear shifter knob.\n\nNote, BMW is also likely to offer the 2-Series coupe's available Track Handling Package for the new convertible. This package adds many of the enhancements mentioned here as well as additional wheel, tire, steering and brake upgrades.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFollow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.", "High beams are meant to light up dark paths and allow drivers to safely navigate through the night. Of course, any driver knows the presence of oncoming cars or heavy rain and snow make high beams useless and potentially dangerous. But programmable headlights that sense surrounding objects could allow drivers to use their high beams without blinding surrounding drivers or being blinded themselves by glare during inclement weather.\n\nThese \"smart\" headlights, developed by engineers in at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, blackout small parts of the beam that would otherwise cause problems for the driver. For example, the headlights can track oncoming vehicles and block light that could blind those drivers. They're even precise enough to track precipitation and block out narrow slivers of light that could reflect off raindrops or snowflakes and cause glare.\n\nInstead of a conventional headlight or cluster of LEDs, the research team chose to develop the system using a digital light processing (DLP) projector, a MEMS technology originally developed by Texas Instruments in the late 1980s. In a DLP system, thousands (or sometimes millions) of microscopic mirrors -- each controlling an individual beam of light -- are laid out on a MEMS chip that actuates the mirrors. The CMU researchers modified the system to have more programmable control over the mirrors and the light each one reflects.\n\nIn the CMU invention, a camera senses objects in front of the car, and the millions of individual light beams are automatically adjusted to dim or brighten, depending on what the computer deems most appropriate. With a latency of between 1 and 2.5 milliseconds, the system reacts to environmental changes almost instantly.\n\nThe headlight system is also designed to highlight traffic signs or lane markings that might be obscured, and can even work in concert with a navigation system to better direct drivers on the road.\n\nAutomakers have been developing better headlight systems for some time now. (BMW even developed laser-powered headlights.) However, \"most of these are one-off systems... with different headlights required for different specialized tasks,\" Srinivasa Narasimhan, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon and one of the researchers who developed the programmable system, said in a press release. \"We can do all this and more with the same headlight.\"\n\nThe researchers reported their findings to the European Conference on Computer Vision in Zurich, Switzerland, on 10 September. As of now, trucks and buses are the only vehicles large enough to use the smart headlights, but the research team hopes to soon make versions small enough for installation on most light vehicles.", "Bags of sunshine and hundreds of people ensured a \"very successful\" Classics in Uppingham day.\n\nThere were 40 cars ranging from Rolls Royce to mini and a more modern BMW I8 electric car at the event on Sunday.\n\nThis was the fourth year of the show, held ever two years in the town's Market Place and High Street\n\nOrganised by the community partnership Uppingham First and the Rutland branch of the Rotary Club, it also featured classical music including jazz and soul.\n\nThere was singing, bag pipes and music performed by pupils from Uppingham School, Uppingham Community College and Uppingham Primary.\n\nRon Simpson, director and secretary of Uppingham First said: \"The music and singing was superb.

Here's everything you need to know about EVs\n\nPetrol and diesel might not run out in our lifetimes, but alternatives are beginning to make inroads, largely thanks to rising fossil fuel costs and concerns about the planet's wellbeing. At some point we will have to change our wasteful ways, whether we want to or not. See also: 5 reasons to buy an electric car and 5 reasons not to\n\nHybrids such as the Toyota Prius have been around for longer than most people realise, but fully electric vehicles (EVs) with no petrol or diesel engine are still pretty new. New, that is, in the sense they are being re-explored after their hay day in the 1900's ? before the combustion engine's rise to prominence.\n\nIt is, therefore, strange that such an old and reliable technology is now playing catch up. But with advances in lightweight materials, car construction and battery technologies the electric car is more viable than ever.\n\nThe government offers some hefty incentives to switch to all-electric, but is it enough? In this feature we'll look at the tech inside EVs (including tech and convenience features such as apps for controlling and monitoring charging) as well as the proliferation (or lack) of charging points and options.\n\nElectric cars in the UK: State of the market The negatives\n\nElectric cars are wonderful in theory, especially if the electricity used to power them comes from a renewable, clean source such as wind or tidal power. But they are hamstrung by a few main issues, the first of which is range. The majority of electric cars have at best a 150-mile range before running out of juice.\n\nThat may sound plentiful, but most manufacturers are presenting best case figures. A number of variables such as temperature and driving style can and will bring that total figure down. Assuming a perfect range is achievable, 150 miles means you can only go 75 miles before the return journey becomes impossible without stopping to charge. A far cry from the hundreds of miles a diesel can manage, then.\n\nAt this point the next issue comes into play. While Britain's electric car charging network is getting better, some journeys really do require forward planning or you could end up stranded by the roadside.\n\nIt helps little that your average electric car takes a long time to charge by a conventional socket. Think days, not hours. See how your boss reacts when you tell him you couldn't make it in because your car was only half charged. Luckily most manufacturers offer a 'fast-charging' system for your home for a fee, which speeds up the process to overnight.\n\nThere's also the option of applying for a domestic charging grant, which if eligible would give you a permanent solution to recharging your car quickly at home.\n\nThe last major hurdle is price. Electric cars are inherently expensive, even though the government offers a \u00a35,000 plug-in grant. A Nissan Leaf and full ownership of the battery will set you back \u00a321,490 after the grant is factored in. A VW e-Up, meanwhile, is \u00a319,270 ? nearly double the \u00a38,635 1.0-litre petrol model.\n\nThat assumes you buy the battery outright. Some manufacturers may only let you lease the battery, others will give you a choice. The battery lease option for a Nissan Leaf starts at \u00a370 a month, but soon ramps up if you plan to do a higher number of miles per year.\n\nBattery leasing does have some benefits. At any point if the battery goes wrong or stops charging for whatever reason, the car manufacturer will swap it for no extra cost. This is unlike buying the car outright, which would land you with a hefty bill to replace the batteries at the cost of thousands. Around \u00a38,000 in the case of the Nissan Leaf, in fact.\n\nThe positives\n\nElectric vehicles may be inherently expensive, but they can work from a financial perspective. The most obvious point is their fuel. Rather than pay \u00a31.50 per litre for however many miles your car can manage, an electric car needs only electricity. Depending on your electric tariff and charger type, you can pay as little as \u00a32 for a full charge. That is pretty cheap motoring for a 150-mile range.\n\nThen there's the CO2 emissions (specifically, the complete lack of any). Zero emissions means exemption from Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and London's Congestion Charge, saving you \u00a310 a day in the case of the latter. All you have to worry about in the case of London is the annual \u00a310 registration charge.\n\nMaintenance is another plus point. Electric motors run without oil and are simple to repair. The electric motor is, after all, a relatively old invention. In addition, there's no need to replace something like the exhaust or clutch because there isn't one.\n\nThe garage cost will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, but it is usually at least on a level with a comparable fossil fuel equivalent. Servicing is needed as frequently as a petrol or diesel engine, but far fewer moving parts means, in theory, less time needed to check everything over.\n\nSadly the necessary expertise means you will have to go to a main dealership to get any work carried out, as electric car repairs are going to be out of the reach for most garages. Dealers (sometimes referred to as 'stealers' because of the prices they charge) will likely charge a premium. A Tesla Model S service, for instance, costs \u00a3500.\n\nOn this subject, breakdowns will probably be an issue for most electric cars. Specialist tools and knowhow makes roadside recovery and repairs a problem. At least roadside recovery providers are upping their game, with the AA offering access to a fast portable charger if you run out of juice.\n\nWhile many of us love the roar of an engine, there is a real novelty when riding in an electric vehicle. It's eerily peaceful, with only the hum of other cars cutting through the air, rubber on tarmac and your passengers breaking up the silence.\n\nEven with all the savings, the initial financial outlay will take some time to recoup. Years, in fact, unless you really drive serious miles. But there will be a point where you start to see a return providing you keep the vehicle for a long enough time. That's before you factor in the decreased reliance on fuels that will eventually run out.\n\nElectric cars in the UK: List of cars and prices Nissan Leaf\n\nThere are a number of electric cars on the market. Perhaps the best known is the Nissan Leaf, which in its latest form offers a range of 124 miles. It starts from \u00a321,490 if you buy outright or \u00a316,490 plus at least \u00a370 a month on the battery lease, depending on your mileage requirements. The government plug-in grant is included.\n\nVW e-Up\n\nThe all-electric version of the VW e-Up supermini is one of the better options on the market. It costs from \u00a319,270 before any extras and has a range of 93 miles, which is enough for cruising about town.\n\nFord Focus Electric\n\nExactly like a petrol or diesel Ford Focus, only it has an electric motor instead. While very smooth and practical, the \u00a328,580 price is very steep given it has a 100-mile range.\n\nTesla Model S\n\nA shining beacon of what electric cars can do, the Tesla Model S is fast, frugal but mighty expensive. In its 60kWh battery form, it can do 240 miles. Go for the pricier 85kWh model and you can expect 300 miles. It has a gigantic touchscreen display and, in its Performance guise, absurd performance. 0 to 62mph takes 4.2 seconds, for example. Prices start from \u00a349,900, which isn't that bad, considering.\n\nRenault Twizy\n\nTechnically this bizarre two-seater looks more like a bike than a car, especially when windows are an optional extra. Still, this is an incredibly cheap electric car for those who need a runaround, with prices starting from \u00a36,895. A range of between 30 and 50 miles is hardly plentiful, but okay for urban life.\n\nMercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive\n\nMercedes is no stranger to electric cars, as the bright green SLS AMG Electric Drive supercar proves. On a more realistic scale, it released an all-electric version of the B-Class, which is a premium attempt at electric motoring. Prices are reportedly going to start from \u00a332,000.\n\nBMW i3\n\nSome manufacturers are turning existing cars electric. BMW has gone in at the deep end with two cars built from the ground up that look, quite honestly, like they are from a different planet. We'll ignore the impressive i8 because it costs \u00a3100,000. The i3 is a more realistic proposition, although the \u00a330,680 entry price is hardly cheap. Without the range extender it can do up to 100 miles on a single charge.\n\nRenault Zoe\n\nAnother solid option for wannabe electric car owners is the Renault Zoe. Apart from being stylish and practical, it costs from \u00a313,995. Not bad considering it has a range of up to 130miles, although you will need to pay a minimum of \u00a370 a month to lease the battery.\n\nSmart ForTwo Electric Drive\n\nA smart choice for frugal motorists. The Smart fortwo electric drive costs from \u00a315,395 in coupe form and \u00a316,895 for the cabrio. Again, there is an option to buy outright or rent the battery.\n\nElectric cars in the UK: Buying a used model\n\nElectric cars should be cheap because of the fear you may have to replace the batteries one day, even if they are expected to last up to a decade. There are some good deals around if you are tempted and slightly brave. A used 2013 Nissan Leaf, for instance, could be yours for \u00a313,995.\n\nIf you go down this route check the warranty and make sure it carries over to another owner. Ask to see the maximum charge capacity if you can so you have an idea of the battery condition. With so few electric cars on the road, it is hard to judge the second-hand market at this time.\n\nElectric cars in the UK: Charging options\n\nYour first option for charging is at home, but as previously discussed this can be a slow process if the battery is quite large. It is, therefore, usually a good idea to get a fast charger from the manufacturer if you have the option.\n\nWhen out and about, Zap-Map provides a map of charging points. It displays each charger using a colour so you know whether to expect a slow, fast, rapid AC or rapid DC charge. You can search by vehicle if unsure what your vehicle needs. A rapid charger can charge a compatible electric car by 80 per cent in less than half an hour so you need not wait too long to go again. Bear in mind that rapid charging is often an optional extra (it's a different connector) at the time you buy the car.\n\nTesla owners can make use of the growing supercharger network for free. Superchargers are being installed across busy routes, including the journey to Europe, enhancing the usefulness of its cars.\n\nAnother supplier, Ecotricity, offers its Electric Highway located on motorways to anyone for free. All you have to do is swipe a card, which you can register for free, and you have access to various charging point types. Just bear in mind you will have to pay for parking if the service station is anything but a Welcome Break.\n\nAnother charging option is Source London. For \u00a310 a year electric car owners can 'refuel' at hundreds of charging points throughout the capital. All it requires is an annual membership.\n\nSadly, as you are unable to book a public charging point, you may have to wait while a fellow eco-friend finishes charging their vehicle. With electric car numbers low, this could be a non-issue but increasing popularity will change that.\n\nA little prior research into the charging plug for your car will ensure you can fill up on the move if you are ever caught short. Just ensure you keep an eye on the car ? it is not uncommon for someone to pull out the plug for fun. Some models have locks which prevent this, but it's easy to forget to enable it.\n\nIn terms of the energy cost, Ecotricity is offering car owners 1,000 miles of free electricity, making a nightly charge even cheaper. The actual cost to charge a vehicle will depend on your usage, battery capacity and your energy rate. This could range from \u00a31 to \u00a34. Still far cheaper than filling up with petrol or diesel. Check with your energy supplier to see if they offer an electric car tariff.\n\nCertain places in the UK offer free parking for electric vehicles, Westminster and Islington being two examples.\n\nElectric cars in the UK: technology Batteries\n\nBatteries will last up to ten years for most current electric cars. Tesla guarantees its battery for eight years on the 85kWH model. It is too early to say how reliable the batteries will be, but most manufacturers will cover a drop in capacity under the warranty ? 70 to 75 per cent, usually. It's worth noting this point: battery capacity won't remain at 100 percent forever. If the manufacturer claims a range of 100 miles, that's with a battery in perfect condition (and also with the ideal weather conditions).\n\nAfter some years, the capacity could drop to 70 percent - that's 70 miles in this example - but it could be even lower in winter when it's cold. Plus, in cold weather you'll use up more energy by using the car's heater, lights, heated screens etc.\n\nEarly indications from electric car owners suggest the range of a battery changes little, if at all, but the real truth may emerge over the next few years. Or, of course, they outlive their shelf life and everyone will be happy.\n\nApps\n\nA number of apps exist that allow owners to do some pretty cool stuff with their car. Planning an early morning? You can pre-warm or pre-cool a car's cabin. Lost your car? Some apps will show you on a map where you need to go to be reunited.\n\nThe Tesla app available for free can even tell you your remaining range and where to charge up without you being in the car, which can help you plan your day more easily. It can even flash the lights, honk the horn and, in the case it is stolen, track the vehicle's whereabouts.\n\nSome manufacturers offer the ability to send route destinations to your car from a computer using Google Send to Car. No need to write a post code down on a bit of paper anymore.\n\nElectric cars in the UK: Why you shouldn't buy an EV\n\nThe Tesla Model S is obviously only for the wealthy, but change has to start somewhere. In many ways the Californian company has shown the world you can have a comfortable, practical and extremely fast all-electric vehicle, which is a good thing.\n\nHowever, look at more realistic vehicles such as the Renault Zoe and the price is still a big barrier to entry. You could buy the equivalent new petrol or diesel model - many now have extremely small engines with turbos for decent performance and economy - and still have thousands and thousands in your pocket. Use that difference in cost to pay for the fuel and you'll still save money even in the long run. If you don't do many miles per year, you'll save even more.\n\nWhether you should buy an electric car is therefore highly dependent on your situation. Those who wait for the next-generation of electric vehicles will probably benefit from bigger ranges, cheaper batteries and increasingly efficient production processes that will further reduce the cost.\n\nIf you drive tens of thousands of miles per year (on short journeys) and can afford the initial outlay, an EV could just save you money. Anyone needing to drive the length and breadth of the UK will have to look at the hybrid route or stick with a solid diesel or petrol, because electric cars simply don't have the rangeyet, and it really isn't feasible to sit for hours while your car recharges part way through a journey.\n\nHopefully all-electric cars will bring affordable, greener motoring to the masses currently crushed by ridiculous fuel prices, rising insurance and other costs. But there is still a long way to go.\n\nReally, though, we should all encourage people to buy EVs: the more electric cars sold, the more car manufacturers will put effort into developing them, leading to greater affordability and improved technologies.", "BMW has introduced a new diesel engine for its 2-Series Coupe model.\n\nThe Bavarian manufacturer has replaced the 2.0-liter diesel unit in the 220d Coupe with a new power plant with the same displacement. Equipped with BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology and generating 190 PS (140 kW) and 400 Nm (295 lb-ft) of torque, the B47 diesel works with a either a revised 8-speed automatic transmission or a 6-speed manual.\n\nWhen fitted with the automatic, the car does the 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) acceleration in only 7 seconds, while the average fuel consumption is rated between 4.1 and 3.8 l/100 km (61.8 to 57.3 mpg UK).\n\nIf equipped with the 6-speed manual gearbox, the 220d Coupe sprints from 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) 0.1 seconds slower (7.1 seconds) and averages between 4.4 to 4.1 l/100 km (57.3 to 53.5 mpg).", "Baidu's forays into automated vehicles will get a luxury sheen thanks to a just-announced R&D partnership with BMW.\n\nThe Chinese search giant tells Tech in Asia that it will work with the Munich-based automaker to develop a highly automated driving (HAD) car specifically for the Chinese market, which makes use of Baidu's 3D mapping technology. The two firms also said they expect to release a working prototype of a vehicle within the next three years, though Baidu emphasizes that the partnership won't necessarily yield a product for commercial release.\n\nA HAD car is not a driverless vehicle. Instead, HAD brings some limited features that don't require input from the driver, such as automatic parking or highway cruising.

The 'Halo' system uses a magnetic field to reenergize an EV's batteries in the same way that cordless smartphone chargers do.\n\nThe firm chose an interesting place to test its concepts, the FIA Formula E Gran Prix in Beijing, China. A competition for one-seater, electrically powered racecars, the event employed a BMW i8 and i3 as safety and extraction cars during its debut this past weekend.\n\nThe connection between Formula E and two Bimmers is obvious, but the telecommunications company chose the event as a testing ground for a very practical reason: the lack of cables and connections keep the safety cars charged and ready to respond at all times.\n\n\"The BMW i8 and i3 models are fantastic, both in terms of performance and ground-breaking design,\" said Marketing Director of Formula E Jaume Sallares. \"With the wireless electrical vehicle charging technology from Qualcomm, it means they can be rapidly deployed, without unplugging, ensuring they get out on track attending to incidents without delay.\"\n\nRelated: Telecom company Qualcomm testing wireless EV charging on the track, predicts 2017 consumer debut\n\nTo further promote its wireless charging tech, Qualcomm recently released a video of the i8 safety car shredding its tires on a racetrack\n\nQualcomm's engineers struggle to describe their Halo EV charging system as Formula E pilot Nelson Piquet Jr. rips the hybrid around the asphalt.

My experience with bikes from the 1950s and '60s -- particularly with British bikes from that era -- has given me a real appreciation for how great motorcycles are today. Those old machines are almost a different species from what's available these days.\n\nI'm not saying that today's bikes are absolutely perfect. Literal perfection in such a complex machine isn't possible. But when fit, finish, quality, reliability, and performance are as good as they are now, perfection is at least approached. And while many of us might consider perfection the ultimate goal, I want to suggest there might be some lurking problems or hidden dangers in our pursuit of perfection. Could we be missing something when the products we buy are already so good?\n\nSome people will suggest that perfection is antithetical to \"character\" and that vintage bikes are somehow more engaging because their faults and idiosyncrasies challenge us. Another group might insist that perfect products preclude \"tinkering.\" Think about everyone who complained when electronic fuel injection overtook carburetion. Although both these attitudes hold some truth, those aren't the pitfalls I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of deeper changes in the very nature of industry.\n\nIn my column for the August issue ( click here to see \"Rotary Reassessment\" ) I described an innovative rotary valve system for four-stroke engines originally developed for Formula 1 competition then summarily banned. Further development has stalled; it hasn't been adapted for production use either. Because current engine technology is so highly developed, and because it represents such an enormous investment of time, talent, and resources, even if a new technology offers significant advantages, the prospect of having to invest an equivalent level of development in any new technology is simply too daunting.\n\nThat's just one way advanced development can limit innovation and invention. When existing technologies work so well, any new invention looks risky. If things are working fine, why should manufacturers rock the boat? Consumers can be just as conservative. When bike buyers (and bike journalists, too) are accustomed to highly developed, near-perfect vehicles, they might not appreciate that new technology will require a few years of development before it achieves a level of refinement that matches expectations.\n\nThis was the case in 1992 when Yamaha released its GTS1000, featuring my novel RADD front suspension design. That bike had somewhat heavy steering, causing many journalists (and potential buyers) to jump to the conclusion that my suspension design suffered heavy steering as a necessary side effect. In fact, the steering feel was completely a byproduct of specific geometry decisions that Yamaha made for that application. Different geometry would have produced very different steering traits. Further development would have tuned out the \"heavy\" steering character, but impatient critics, accustomed to \"perfection,\" expected the bike to be fully developed from the start.\n\nOccasionally, manufacturers have the courage to buck this system and risk investing significantly in unknown technology. This was the case with BMW and its various Telelever, Duolever, and Paralever alternative suspension designs. Certainly all of these systems were subjected to their fair share of criticism over the years, but BMW remained committed to their ongoing development and refinement. Now all these systems are considered credible alternatives to conventional suspension designs, contributing to BMW's reputation as a company dedicated to original engineering.\n\nA very high level of development is a disincentive to try new things for both manufacturers and the marketplace because any new technology will have rough edges at first. BMW has shown us that, with some commitment, a high level of development (read: near perfection) can coexist with innovation, but this is the exception. The making and selling of \"perfect\" products is generally at odds with an open, searching interest in new ideas. Manufacturers -- and buyers -- might do well to observe these pitfalls in the pursuit of perfection. I think accepting more rough edges would allow more original ideas and inventions to thrive.", "Audi and General Motors' luxury brand, Cadillac, have both set their sights on bringing autonomous driving features to their cars in 2016.\n\nAudi has been wowing the crowds at technology events and auto shows for the past two years with demonstrations of the autonomous driving capabilities it's currently developing. But until now, the Volkswagen-owned company has been less than willing to put a timeframe on when some of the self-driving features would be leaving the lab and becoming features on actual cars.\n\nHowever, during a keynote address at the Frankfurt School of Finance, attended by Bloomberg, Audi's CFO Axel Strotbeck detailed a system that would enable a car to follow at a safe distance from the one ahead, automatically accelerating and braking and capable of autonomously adjusting steering to maintain the line, too. He said that the feature would be coming \"very soon\", but that statement is being interpreted to mean in 2016.\n\nThe date hasn't been plucked out of thin air. BMW, Mercedes and Volvo are all currently putting similar systems through their paces, getting them safe and reliable enough for the real world and GM's CEO Mary Barra confirmed that \"car2car\" communication and \"super cruise\" technologies would be coming to the Cadillac range in 2016.\n\nSuper cruise is GM's term for the same enhanced cruise control technology that its Germany luxury competitors are developing offering semi-autonomous driving capabilities in very specific circumstances, such as on freeways and in traffic jams.\n\nAnnouncing the addition of car2car communication, a technology that uses wi-fi signals and 3G or 4G mobile internet for vehicles and elements of road infrastructure to talk to each other in order to avoid collisions and eliminate blind spots, Barra said: \"We are not doing this for the sake of the technology itself; we're doing it because it's what customers around the world want.\"\n\nAnd a report by ABI Research out this week backs up her statement that driverless vehicles will be increasingly in demand, predicting shipments to go from 1.1 million in 2024 to 42 million in 2035 and projecting an \"installed base\" of 176 million driverless vehicles.\n\nMary Barra was speaking at the Intelligent Transport System World Congress in Detroit where a host of car companies demonstrated their latest breakthroughs in the field of autonomous and connected driving. Honda showcased how its system is capable of controlling a car as it merges on to or exits the freeway, as well as changing lanes and making allowances for other cars merging on to the road.\n\n\"The creation and deployment of advanced, intelligent transportation systems represent the new frontier in the effort to one day eliminate traffic collisions, injuries and fatalities,\" said Frank Paluch, president of Honda R&D Americas, Inc.\n\nAs innovative as these new technologies are, none of them can truly replace a human driver yet, and that's because there is still a long way to go before driverless cars are a reality.\n\nThe picture that Google paints of a future full of fully autonomous vehicles is very exciting and appealing but we're a long way from that future. Google's fleet of autonomous cars have covered nearly three quarters of a million miles but they're only capable of driving on roads where detailed maps have already been generated. They don't recognise temporary traffic lights, are yet to prove they can drive in snow or rain and they don't know how to navigate carparks.\n\nIn a recent MIT Technology Review article, Lee Gomes lists in detail the obstacles still facing Google in getting its cars to be as observant and understanding as even the least attentive human driver when it comes to things like knowing the difference between a pedestrian and a policeman, a piece of crumpled paper and a rock in the middle of the road.\n\nThe head of Google's autonomous car project, Chris Urmson has set himself a deadline of solving all of the problems by 2024, when his son is old enough to drive. But in the meantime, traditional carmakers will continue their slow and steady progress towards offering individual autonomous systems that are ready for the road.", "Amid General Motors' confirmation of we already knew -- that Cadillac will add a new super-luxury sedan in 2015 to compete with the Audi A8, BMW 7-series, Mercedes S-class and Lexus LS -- don't lose sight of the brand's greater challenge: Catching up in the luxury SUV market.\n\nCadillac's SRX five-seat crossover has grown older than key competitors, and we've yet to hear anything about the brand's plans for a smaller compact SUV to compete with vehicles like the BMW X1, Land Rover Evoque and Lincoln MKC. Lexus will join the growing compact crossover battle with the little NX this fall.\n\nThe midsize SRX was an instant hit for Cadillac when it went on sale as a 2010 model. It's Cadillac's best-selling vehicle in the U.S. and a hit in China, where luxury SUVs are the rage. Despite that, the SRX has lost its edge as competitors introduced new models. Its fuel economy trails the leaders by several miles per gallon, and its features and styling are growing dated.\n\n\u25a0 Related: 'The big nasty': 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 to start at $78,995\n\nCadillac will introduce a new SRX in the third quarter of 2015, according to Autodata's forecast.

That new segment won't match sales of the larger SRX-type in the U.S., but it's vital to any luxury brand's growth in the rest of the world. Autodata says a compact Cadillac SUV will arrive late next year, years after the X1, Evoque and Mercedes GLK pioneered the segment, and at least a year behind Lincoln's fine new MKC.\n\nCadillac has done a great job updating the car side of its business. The ATS, CTS and XTS are all very good, but Caddy's car sales were off 14% through July as other luxury brands introduce their own new models.\n\nThe result is that Cadillac's overall U.S. sales are down 2% so far this year, while sales of BMW, Lexus and Mercedes have grown.\n\nDelays building the new Escalade large SUV have exacerbated the problem. Cadillac needs to speed up deliveries, or risk alienating some of its wealthiest and most loyal customers. To get back on track, Cadillac needs the new SRX and a smaller sibling to be on time and excellent.\n\nWhile all that's going on, GM's luxury brand must also launch its S-class fighter next year, and do it flawlessly. To begin lifting Cadillac's status to the same level as Mercedes and BMW, the car -- which may be called the LTS -- must be the most advanced, luxurious and reliable car GM has ever built.\n\nEven if the LTS succeeds, it'll take years to convince luxury buyers the car and Cadillac are a match for the leaders.\n\nThat's why it's so important the brand stay focused on market segments where it already has credibility, like the SRX.\n\nThe battle for pickup fuel economy is heating up, months before the highly anticipated 2015 Ford F-150 will go on sale.\n\nLook for several GM pickups and SUVs' EPA fuel economy ratings to rise this fall as the automaker's new eight-speed automatic transmission hits the road. The gearbox will also replace the current six-speed in the 2015 Corvette and the 650-hp Corvette ZO6 super car that goes on sale next year.\n\nGM will push the efficient new transmission into production on high-selling pickups and SUVs with 6.2-liter V8 engines this fall. It will work its way into GM cars and trucks with smaller engines -- and higher sales volumes over the next few years.\n\nThe gearbox is about 5% more efficient than the six-speed automatic that has been a GM mainstay for the last few years. That doesn't necessarily translate directly to a 5% improvement in fuel economy, but you can expect GM to hang at least one more m.p.g. on the trucks' EPA highway fuel economy labels. That means at least 22 m.p.g. for the 420-hp GMC Sierra pickup and 19 m.p.g. in the 403-hp Cadillac Escalade SUV.\n\nThe battle for pickup fuel-economy leadership is heating up as Ford gets ready to unveil its aluminum-bodied F-150, which should be several hundred pounds lighter than steel-bodied Chevy, GMC and Ram pickups.\n\nRam already offers an eight-speed, but Ford is expected to stick with its current six-speed until a new 10-speed it's working on is ready in a couple of years. A GM 10-speed should hit the road around the same time.", "U.S consumers continued buying new cars and trucks at a torrid pace in August as easy credit and a wave of new products fueled showroom traffic, driving the industry's annualized rate above 17 million for the first time since July 2006.\n\n\"We had an early Labor Day weekend that fell into the end of August, and it really pumped up sales for the month,\" said John Felice, Ford's president of U.S. sales and marketing.\n\nOverall, the industry sold more than 1.58 million cars and trucks, a 5.5% increase over last August with one less selling day, said Bill Fay, Toyota's group vice president and general manager.\n\nFay said most sectors of the economy are stable or improving. Interest rates remain near historic lows, and gas prices are lower than in recent years.\n\n\"It is really pretty darn close to a perfect situation out there,\" Fay said.\n\nThe annual selling rate last month reached 17.5 million, according to Autodata. To put that in perspective, the industry only sold 10.2 million new vehicles in 2009, the trough of the Great Recession. Not since 2001 have automakers sold more than 17 million vehicles in the U.S.\n\nAutomakers are bumping up sales with incentives that averaged about $300 more per vehicle than in August 2013, according to Kelley Blue Book. Still, new cars and trucks are now selling for $32,495 -- about $851 more than the average sale price last August -- reflecting the strength of higher priced pickups, large SUVs and luxury cars.\n\n\"We are seeing a lot of promotions,\" said Michele Krebs, an analyst with AutoTrader.com. \"Yes, incentives were up, but there also was a lot of excitement driven by a lot of advertising.\"\n\nChrysler sales jumped 20% in August, while General Motors posted a 1% drop and Ford sales were flat from a year earlier.\n\nNissan and Subaru led the way among Asian automakers with increases of 11.5% and 22%, respectively. Toyota was up 6.3%, Hyundai sales rose 6%, Kia, 5%, and Honda edged up 0.4%. Volkswagen, which has struggled throughout the year, posted a 3.8% decline.\n\nChrysler's strong performance again was led by Jeep Cherokee and Ram trucks. Jeep sales surged 49% while Ram sales rose 39%. Sales increased 4% for the Chrysler brand, while Dodge and Fiat sales tumbled 6% and 20%, respectively.\n\nGM sales of Silverado pickups increased 13% and GMC Sierra sales rose 10%.\n\nBut Cadillac sales dropped 18% while sales increased 11.6% for Mercedes-Benz, 10.1% for Lexus and 5.5% for BMW.\n\n\"Cadillac is a brand that I would be concerned about,\" Krebs said, especially since its flagship car, the CTS, is new and the ATS compact sedan is relatively new. \"They are core models for Cadillac that go squarely against the German competitors, and they just are not performing very well.\"\n\nBuick slipped 10%, and Chevrolet was down 1%. GMC, with sales up 10.4%, was GM's only brand to beat year-earlier levels.\n\nFord sold 222,174 vehicles, up 0.4%, recording its best August in eight years despite a 6% decline in fleet sales. Ford brand sales edged up 0.5% while Lincoln was down 0.6%.\n\nAutomakers, banks and other lenders are making more longer loans -- as long as seven or eight years -- to people with low credit scores. The industry is producing more. While the average price of a car keeps rising, some customers are demanding and getting substantial discounts.\n\nFord sales analyst Erich Merkle described the month as a tale of three industries. Demand and prices are strong for full-size trucks. Crossovers, especially small ones, are a growing segment that shows no signs of slowing. But passenger cars, especially among the Detroit Three, have seen sales go flat and prices start to deteriorate, Felice said.\n\nThe midsize car segment accounted for about 16% of sales in August, down from 16.2% from the same month last year, Merkle said. Meanwhile, sales of small crossovers and SUVs increased to 17.4% in August, up about 2% from a year earlier.\n\nThe average selling price for crossovers is $1,000 higher than a year ago and pickups are $2,800 higher, Merkle said.\n\n\"The pressure on cars continues,\" Merkle said. \"We think that that the small utility trend will continue as baby boomers become empty-nesters. ... Unfortunately, it pulls something out of the pricing for cars.\"", "Front-drive hatchbacks are the name of the game these days in the German automotive industry. In recent years BMW has gotten into the game with the 2 Series Active Tourer, while Audi has stepped up its game with the A1 and Mercedes has been keen to play, too. The Silver Arrow has rolled out the new A-Class and its sedan sister, the CLA, as well as the GLA crossover, and you can bet there'll be more to come. But Benz doesn't want you to forget about the B-Class, so it's introducing an updated version.\n\nMercedes first introduced the B-Class back in 2005, replacing it with the second-generation model in 2011. But with its newer stablemates garnering the lion's share of attention at the bottom of the Benz range, and increased competition from rival automakers, the B-Class has undergone some minor updates. Up front you'll find a reshaped bumper, grille and headlights, along with new taillights and bumper around back. There's also a revised interior designed to convey a more upscale environment, with color-changing ambient lighting and an eight-inch touchscreen display atop the dashboard. Of course, this being a Mercedes update, the new B-Class benefits from added safety systems as well.\n\nBuyers in markets where the B-Class is sold will be able to choose between three new trim levels and a staggering array of four-cylinder engine options, with gasoline engines ranging in output from 122 to 211 horsepower, and diesels from 90 to 177 hp - some available with 4Matic all-wheel drive. There's also a natural gas version, and the B-Class Electric Drive - the only version offered Stateside - continues with the same output.

Each bike was customized by a leading Japanese firm, resulting in four distinctly different bikes: \"Cyclone,\" by Go Takamine, \"Highway Fighter,\" by Kaichiroh Kurosu, \"Clubman Racer,\" by Shiro Nakajima and \"Boxer,\" by Hideya Togashi. BMW's press material below includes images of each bike, and you can also scroll through the gallery at the bottom of the page for more images.\n\nBMW Motorrad presents R nineT custom bikes.\n\nThe unique creative statements of Japanese customisers.\n\nMunich. The BMW Motorrad Days Japan - the biggest BMW Motorrad event in the country - were held at the Hakuba47 Mountain Sports Park on 30.-31, August. BMW Motorrad fans were not only treated to a wide range of exhibition stands but also round-the-clock entertainment. However, a particular highlight on the events stage came in the form of the premiere of four BMW R nineT motorcycles, each of which was the result of a unique custom conversion by leading Japanese customising firms.\n\nOnce the welcome and introductory speeches had been given by Florian Renndorfer, head of BMW Motorrad Asia, Pacific, Middle East, China and South Africa, it was the engine sound and the design of these four Custom R nineT that dominated the proceedings. Go Takamine (Brat Style), Kaichiroh Kurosu (Cherry's Company), Shiro Nakajima (46 Works) and Hideya Togashi (HIDE Motorcycle) had all taken on the challenge to transform a BMW R nineT into an individual creation of their own design in less than 200 days.\n\nGo Takamine's creation by the name of 'Cyclone' was welcomed to the stage to thunderous applause, and was presented by no less a personage than the BMW Motorrad acrobat himself, multiple stunt riding world champion, Chris Pfeiffer. Go Takamine's interpretation of the R nineT was in the style of a so-called tracker bike, revealing a light-footed filigree character, crowned by an immaculate colour design and paintwork, not to mention numerous chrome components. In Go Takamine's words, 'This street bike is my attempt to combine the past with the near future, in the form of a modern, current motorcycle concealed beneath a nostalgic exterior.'\n\nThe 'Highway Fighter' from Kaichiroh Kurosu was the result of a fine stylistic mixture of both historic and current BMW motorcycle elements. Comparisons with the breathtakingly beautiful BMW R7 prototype from 1934 are fully justified, even though Kurosu's creation is essentially a machine that was made in modern production facilities with current styling. Kaichiroh Kurosu put it this way: 'For me the object of the exercise was to look into the future. I imagined what BMW motorcycles might look like ten years from now, and I think that this would still be a pretty cool bike even if the traditional flat-twin engine were to be replaced by an electric motor.'\n\nIn contrast, Shiro Nakajima's 'Clubman Racer' was the result of one man's passion for perfect riding machines, whether on the road or on the racetrack. In terms of lightweight construction and functionality, his interpretation of the R nineT followed on clearly from his previous projects, these largely having been developed for racing use. In the words of Shiro Nakajima, 'What I wanted was to create something a bit more sporty than a cafe racer. A motorcycle that you don't just take into an urban environment or ride over mountains with but one that you can also really enjoy on the racetrack. This was the reason why I chose above all to make it as light as possible.'\n\nHideya Togashi's 'Boxer', on the other hand, is a timeless variation in a classic sport design. Its fairing is reminiscent of the racing replicas of the nineteen seventies, bringing forth both memories and yearnings among motorcycling enthusiasts. Hideya Togashi himself told us, 'The main feature is its slimline aluminium fuel tank. It seems to hug the rider, while the design of the fairing is borrowed from that of nineteen seventies racing models.'\n\nOne person who attended the event who was particularly impressed with the creative talents of the four Japanese customisers was Ola Stenegard, head designer at BMW Motorrad of the R nineT. 'I was absolutely bowled-over. I had high expectations - after all these are four of the best customisers in the world, and in the end I went down on my knees. What they have succeeded in creating here is just astounding. Interestingly, each of these bikes also reflects its creator. The ideas and innovations - just incredible and beautiful. The details - amazing. As I prefer to perform everything on my own motorcycles myself, we had many hours of discussions. About welding aluminium, sharpening metal and sand casting parts. There are so many reasons why I love their creations. Japan's culture of customisation can be summed up like this - if you need a valve cap then let's make one. Or if you want full body covering, why not just make it yourself? They don't simply go out and buy parts. This attitude is somehow rooted in the culture of the Japanese craft trades and it is something I love. This is material for the next level and a perfect complement to the 'first' R nineT family. It is something genuinely inspiring for us at BMW Motorrad. As well as for each and every R nineT owner.'", "The aunt of Tanya Gonzalez, a missing Florida woman, is pleading with the ex-boyfriend who police call a person of interest to return her unharmed.\n\n\"Bring her home,\" said Yvette Oliver of her 28-year-old niece. \"We want to see her and know she is OK. If you really love her like you say you do -- like you always proclaimed -- you'll bring her home to us and let her be.\"\n\nThose words, spoken to The Huffington Post by Oliver, were directed at Roy Ruz Blanco, 33.\n\nThe Miami Police Department has named Blanco a person of interest in Gonzalez's disappearance. \"He was last seen in the Key West area, traveling with an elderly woman and a husky\" dog, a police spokesman told HuffPost Monday evening.\n\nGonzalez has been missing since the afternoon of Sept. 9, after she went shopping with Oliver in Midtown Miami. The aunt and niece left the shopping center in separate cars. Gonzalez has not been seen since.\n\nAccording to Oliver, family members became concerned when Gonzalez failed to show up for her job at Mojito Bar in Bayside.\n\n\"She's a very responsible young lady,\" Oliver said. \"She never calls in sick and is always, always, always on time. That's how we knew something was wrong.\"\n\nAuthorities searched Gonzalez's apartment on Friday. They have not disclosed what, if anything, they found. Her blue, four-door, 2011 BMW 328i with Florida license plate 705-YLJ also is missing, police said.\n\nAttorney Adriana Santiesteban, a family friend and spokeswoman for Gonzalez's family, said the young woman had been having difficulties with Blanco and recently ended a five-year relationship with him.\n\n\"It was a very bad relationship,\" Santiesteban told HuffPost. \"She had a hard time getting out of it and was fearful of him.\"\n\nOliver said Blanco was \"obsessed\" with her niece. \"When they broke up, he was not having it,\" she said. \"He said, 'You're either mine or you're nobody's.'

Investigators said they found no sign of Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez's family has hired a private investigator to help locate her. According to Santiesteban, the investigator learned Blanco rented a boat from a marina in Coconut Grove.\n\n\"He paid cash for it,\" she said. \"He was seen in it with his mom and the dog.\"\n\nSantiesteban said the family learned Monday that the boat was found adrift at sea, 100 miles off the coast of Key West. Authorities have yet to confirm that information.\n\nTanya Gonzalez is described as 5 feet, 7 inches tall, 135 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a white tank top, jeans that were ripped in the middle and beige sandals.\n\n\"We need her back with her family,\" Oliver said. \"We are suffering.\"\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Miami Police Department at 305-603-6300.

Their problem is that they're priced at the same level too, and buyers haven't seen them that way. Will that change under Johan De Nysschen, the CEO Cadillac poached from Infiniti?\n\nNo. No it won't. Nor will massive, Chevrolet-style incentives designed to inflate sales numbers.\n\nThat's what De Nysschen himself said in an interview with Automotive News. He said that as Cadillac \"works to attract the higher-end clientele\", presumably one on par with Audi or BMW, it will have to forsake some of its traditional buyers accustomed to lower prices. Eventually, he says, they will gain traction with the younger, import-oriented crowd.\n\n\"We cannot deny the fact that we are leaving behind our traditional customer base,\" de Nysschen said. \"It will take several years before a sufficiently large part of the audience who until now have been concentrating on the German brands will find us in their consideration set.\"\n\n[...] \"I think the logical conclusion is that it's better to build off a very solid base in terms of [product] credibility, charge a fair price for the car and realize you have to wait until the volume comes,\" he said.\n\nThese days, an ATS is about on par with a BMW 3-Series in pricing, and a CTS mirrors the 5-Series as well. But while the other luxury brands have seen quite a bit of sales growth this year, Cadillac hasn't. U.S. sales were down 5 percent in August versus an 8 percent gain for all luxury manufacturers, Automotive News said.\n\nI think that's a shame, because Cadillac's new cars are really, really good. I wish more buyers looked at the ATS and CTS over the alternatives, both because I think they'd be impressed and because there's something to be said for doing something different and supporting American luxury. Alas, buyers don't seem willing to pay BMW prices for Cadillacs.\n\nThe question is, is De Nysschen doing the right thing, or should Cadillac really consider dropping their MSRPs a bit?", "Banker-turned-biker Valerie Thompson just earned a spot in the Bonneville Salt Flats \"200 MPH Club;\" setting a new land speed record of 208.81 MPH on her BMW S1000 RR superbike.

These are what the Google calls tailored advertising. They are sent to the user on the basis of keywords of the contents in their email inbox. Google uses a software which scans and analyses the content of the emails automatically. Google has the right to send out such advertisements. These are placed above, below, to the side, or directly inside the inbox. It is difficult to stop some of the advertisements.\n\nWhy get rid of the ads\n\nThough not all ads can be eliminated or stopped from reaching the inbox, it is possible to stop the targeted ones. Especially after hearing about how Google analyses the private emails for keywords, a lot of people might just feel uncomfortable, and want to get rid of the feeling of being the subject of the ever- vigilant scanning of private correspondence. Some people even find the tailored ads that are targeted to the user's interest, harder to ignore. Whatever be the reason, it is possible to go through the settings, and change them to avoid the interest- based ads.\n\nHow to get rid of ads\n\nIn order to avoid the targeted ads, one has to go to the Google Ad Settings page, where the 'Opt=out settings' can be found by scrolling down. There is a link, 'Opt out', which is to be clicked to be redirected to the Opt out of interest-based ads on Google page. Then, the next step is to get rid of the narrow banner text ad which is perched on top of every email that is opened on Gmail.\n\nSome users choose to block these out, but, there is a way to eliminate these altogether, which is even easier than blocking them out. By clicking on the gear icon which is in the upper-right corner, the 'Settings' is to be chosen. Next, the user has to click on the Web Clips tab, and then uncheck the box for 'Show my web clips above the Inbox'. Some ads appear as messages in the Gmail inbox in the Promotions tab. These ads in the look of an email can be irritating, and can be removed quite easily. All that the account holder is required to do is delete the Promotions tab. However, such ads may not necessarily appear in the Promotion tab of all the users. Besides, it is also to be remembered that an entire category of emails get quarantined under the Promotions tab which prevents these from getting mixed with the other, more important mails in the primary inbox. On deleting the Promotions tab, the flow of these will emails will be directed to the primary inbox. However, if someone is still determined to get rid of the Promotions tab, he is required to go to the Inbox tab in Settings, where he can uncheck the box for the Promotions tab. Another option for Chrome users is to use the Gmail's extension that allows the user to customize the elements from showing up on Gmail.", "To app or not to app: that is the question. If you're a business owner, you would be silly to think you can ignore mobile users. You know that you need to cater to customers on mobile devices, but the question that often rears its ugly head is: Do I need to optimize my mobile website, build a mobile app, or do both?\n\nThere is no doubting that the mobile web is huge. Stats from 2013 reveal a lot about the current state of web enabled mobile phones across the globe:\n\n56% of people own a smart phone 50% of mobile phone users, use mobile as their primary Internet source 80% of time on mobile is spent inside apps 72% of tablet owners purchase online from their tablets each week\n\nThe good news is that one of those questions is easy to answer - you'll definitely need an optimized mobile website. With so many people accessing the net via mobile, if you don't provide an optimal experience for these users on your site, then you're losing potential customers.\n\nSo, the question now remains, do I also need a mobile app for my business? While an app can be a helpful addition, app design is often more complicated than designing a website, so there are several factors to consider before jumping into the world of Android and iOS apps.\n\nWhat Are The Differences Between Mobile Websites and Apps?\n\nMobile sites are designed specifically for smart phones, tablets, and these days, phablets. These devices have smaller screens than traditional laptops and desktop computers and often don't have the same processing power. Sites designed for mobile devices need to load quickly, use limited bandwidth, and cater to touch screens.\n\nImplementation of a mobile site can take many forms - including a separate mobile version of the site, a responsive design or a combination of responsive and adaptive design. In general, a mobile site is a mini version of a standard website.\n\nApps, on the other hand, are programs that work on mobile devices, but they have to be downloaded before they can be used- just like programs on a computer. Most modern apps require an internet connection to work, but they usually don't require as much bandwidth since images and files are already saved on the device.\n\nPros and Cons of Mobile Sites\n\nIn this day and age, there is no reason why you should not have a mobile site. Internet users are becoming savvier and now expect all businesses, not only major brands, to have a mobile optimized website. Google established 25 principles for mobile website design which work as helpful guidelines when building a mobile optimized website.\n\nYou've probably had the experience of browsing a website meant for a desktop on your mobile device. The last thing you want is a potential customer getting frustrated and leaving your site because it doesn't work well on their phone. Mobile sites can be created with responsive or scalable design, or a separate site can be built specifically for mobile devices.\n\nThe downside of only having a mobile website are that sites don't always have the same functionality as apps, and they require an internet connection as well as a large amount of data transfer to be used. This is why many banks offer a mobile banking app that delivers basic information and functionality, even though most of what is in the app can be done via their website.\n\nPros and Cons of Apps\n\nFor the majority of businesses, an app is overkill. It's not likely that you need an app, but they can be very beneficial in some cases. Along with having a large amount of data pre-loaded and providing much more functionality than what can be accomplished with just a web page, you also have access to push notifications. Push notifications are messages and alerts that show up to users who have installed your app, and are great for notifying people of special deals and new products.\n\nThe downside of apps is that app design is a longer and more expensive process than designing a mobile website. Apps are usually reserved for businesses where a high degree of online customer interaction and engagement is required. Great examples of this include social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. All three provide both a web and app experience.\n\nApps will also require updates and changes to improve their functionality and to fix bugs as they appear. This means that customers who are using the app will need to be notified of any changes, and update their app accordingly. A mobile website, on the other hand, never needs to be re-downloaded and installed.", "Tech rating site, Product Hunt, has raised US $6 million in a new round of funding.

The first 5 people who tweet this article and mention @techcocktail will get a free 6-month Business subscription ($450 value).\n\nRight now, startup PR is pretty much a lose-lose situation for entrepreneurs and journalists.\n\nYou entrepreneurs send out pitches you're unsure about, get ignored, follow up, and get ignored again. You probably start to get frustrated at us journalists: why should we be the gatekeepers? Who are we to say that the idea you're so passionate about isn't interesting?\n\nOn our side, our inboxes get overloaded with dozens or hundreds of emails a day. Many of them are poorly written, too long, or accidentally addressed to our competitors (oops!).\n\nWhat would make this a win-win? Simple: fewer, better, targeted pitches in our inboxes, which would be more likely to garner a response and an article.\n\nPr.co would love to see startup PR move in this direction, and their service for entrepreneurs helps do just that. Pr.co lets you create nice-looking press releases with photos and in multiple languages, send personalized emails to journalists sorted by industry or topic, and track your open and click-through rates. In addition, Pr.co has a simple tool to build a press page that includes your contact info, press releases, press kit, and clippings. The service costs $30/month or $300/year for startups.\n\nWe sat down with CEO Dennis van der Vliet to talk about some of his recommendations for startup PR, from press releases and media lists to email pitches and follow-ups.\n\nPress release\n\nFirst of all, your press release should be about some newsworthy event in your company. As a journalist, for example, I'm tired of getting press releases about little feature updates or changes in personnel. \"There is no point in giving a press release if you bought a new plant for your office,\" says van der Vliet.\n\nInside the press release, he recommends putting all the relevant info a journalist might need to cover you, including links to pictures and videos and your contact info. Weave your news into a hook or angle, some kind of story that goes beyond the actual facts of the situation. For example, you might be \"a startup that Amazon should acquire,\" a better version of Feedly, or a photo sharing app that prevents annoying oversharing.\n\nVan der Vliet has even seen startups write five different press releases with different angles, and target them at different journalists. You might use one angle for local media (\"Local resident pursues his dream...\") and a different one for tech media (\"The newest app for sharing GIFs...\").\n\nMedia list\n\nPr.co's guide to building your press list goes into detail on this topic, but van der Vliet emphasizes that you don't need to be sending more than 100 emails. \"There's no way more than 100 journalists are going to be interested in your story,\" he says. Instead, try 50-75: that's about the number of people you can research and get familiar with so your pitch isn't too generic. Pr.co found that open and click-through rates decrease the more emails you send.\n\nBut how do you find those 50-75 reporters? Take the 10 publications you want to get featured on and search their site for keywords related to your industry. (If they don't have search, use Google: \"nfc site:tech.co\" brings up articles mentioning NFC on Tech Cocktail.) Once you find the relevant articles, start following the writers on Twitter and make sure they're still covering similar topics. Then add them to your media list. You can do the same thing starting with a Google Alert, van der Vliet says: pick your keywords, then get a list of articles from across the web by writers who might be interested in you, too.\n\nAnother way to connect with journalists is to help them out first: subscribe to Help a Reporter Out (HARO), where journalists submit queries about articles they're working on. I did a series on what entrepreneurs eat for breakfast and lunch, and got hundreds of responses. Depending on the plan you select, HARO lets you pick topics or even specific keywords that you want to answer queries about. Once you've helped the reporter, you can go back a few months later to pitch them.\n\nAlso, says van der Vliet, don't forget to add local newspapers to your media list, as well as your family, friends, advisors, and investors. A tweet from someone influential in your network could be as helpful as a news article.\n\nPitch email\n\nAmong Pr.co users, van der Vliet has seen two different approaches: some entrepreneurs paste their whole press release into the email, while others send a short email summarizing the news with a link to their press page.\n\nWhich option is better? As a journalist, I personally prefer to receive the latter type of pitch. But van der Vliet doesn't recommend one or the other: it depends on your story and your audience, he says. Either way, you should aim for a 35-40% open rate and a 15% click-through rate.\n\nFollow up\n\nVan der Vliet's recommendation for whether to follow up? \"See it like dating: if a guy or girl doesn't respond to your text messages, are you going to be stalking them at home or are you going to back off?\"\n\nThe first factors to look at are open and click-through rates. An open or a click could indicate some interest, but an unopened email doesn't necessarily mean they're not interested. Not all email providers allow you to track opens, and someone who didn't open an email may just have missed it. In the end, van der Vliet says, it's up to you to do your research on the journalist and ask yourself the tough question: is this something they'd actually be curious about, or is it just wishful thinking on your part? The idea that consumes and energizes you might leave them indifferent. If that's the case, skip the follow-up.\n\nYes, we journalists can be cruel sometimes. But so can you entrepreneurs, who send us three follow-ups, tweet at us, and try to track down our phone number. Let's get on the same page and we'll all be happier.", "The Mission Main Street Grant program by Chase is in full swing.

It is the most popular online game on Xbox, and the top paid app for Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating system in the U.S.\n\nMicrosoft said it will to continue to make \"Minecraft\" available across all the platforms on which it is available today: PC, iOS, Android, Xbox and PlayStation.\n\n\"Minecraft is more than a great game franchise it is an open world platform, driven by a vibrant community we care deeply about, and rich with new opportunities for that community and for Microsoft,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nMicrosoft expects the acquisition to be break-even in fiscal 2015.\n\nIn a blog post, Mojang said its founders, Markus Persson, known as \"Notch\"; Carl Manneh; and Jakob Pors\u00e9r are leaving the company.\n\nMicrosoft is primarily known for the Windows operating system and business software like its Microsoft Office suite. But this acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division, which also includes game franchises such as the \"Halo\" shooter game and \"Forza\" racing game.\n\nMicrosoft bought Nokia's phone business for $7.3 billion in April and is also seeking to boost Microsoft's Windows Phone system, which has gained little traction against Apple's iPhones and Google's Android system. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses -- Windows and Office software installed on desktops -- slow down or decline.\n\n\"We believe the acquisition of the ubiquitous Minecraft game (almost 54 million copies sold) strategically makes sense as Microsoft looks for ways to drive users toward its nascent mobile hardware business, where it can leverage and cross-sell a wide range of its higher-margin software (e.g., Office 365, Windows),\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.\n\nShares fell 26 cents to $46.44 in morning trading.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1tYrVNL", "Many people hear the words \"pop music\" and instantly think of top 40 hits and repetitive Ariana Grande songs on the radio. I would like to introduce you to pop music that isn't just the radio hits, but the hidden gems that will show you why pop is the best genre.\n\nPop music is universal.\n\nSome genres have a limited audience but pop and hip-hop are the two most universal genres in the world. Pop is especially universally because it's catchy, fun and relatable. From Asia to Africa, everyone is loving and creating pop music. For example, look at Namie Amuro, a huge J-Pop idol, showing her love of pop music in this video.\n\nOver the years the pop genre has become more than just singing. It's becoming more about the music, singing and the dancing to hit as many people as possible. Many pop singers do not dance but they instead offer very visually appealing music videos. Which is great help for some of those musicians who are horrible dancers (looking at you, Lorde).\n\nAnyone can get into pop.\n\nPop is open to accepting different sounds in the genre. It's the most sonically-diverse genre on earth so it's easy to get into pop even if your music is influenced by unfamiliar instruments in the deep parts of the Sahara Desert. Psapp, a group known for using unusual instruments, makes electronic-pop music with the sounds of toys. One of their songs is the theme song for \"Grey's Anatomy.\" This goes to show that If the music has a catchy beat and relatable lyrics, you're golden.\n\nEmphasis on production and artistic delivery.\n\nThere are genres that either focus solely on production or solely on artistic delivery. With pop, it's a combination of both and when the relationship between the two is just right, it's downright kismet.\n\nPop music focuses on not just the music, but the visuals too. Hence why pop musicians are more likely to dance and do music videos than non-pop musicians. Dancing is visually appealing and a great music video can help a song stick out more to the audience. Selena Gomez & the Scene's music video for \"Naturally\" is a huge example of how visual effects pull people into liking a song.\n\nPop musicians are less likely to receive flak when changing genre to genre between albums. As long as it sticks to the pop guidelines, people will learn to deal with the change. There is some flack pop musicians receive if they change their music drastically. An example; Nelly Furtado received a lot of criticism because she went from a pop/rock to a hip hop/dance with her album \"Loose.\" Many people were upset about the change and thought she sold out. In time, everyone grew to love and appreciate \"Loose.\" It is now referred to as the best pop album of 2006.\n\nWhen it's famous, it becomes pop.\n\nSeeing what a unique song can do for pop music is exciting to watch. Back in the 90s, many things changed with pop music in this era. Guitarists sprung to fame like Alanis Morrissette, Lisa Loeb and Sheryl Crow really giving off the message that Women rock. Bands like Green Day and Dave Matthews Band started getting big. Hip-hop and rap started hitting the charts and being known as pop music as well. Also boy bands and Spice Girls really changed the setting of pop music in the 2000s. So when a unique musician becomes famous it'll mean a new change to pop. Lorde's different style, but relatable lyrics, proves that pop is always changing even in the 2010s.\n\nMost pop songs you hear are about love and that's cute, but when you really dig (or just google) you'll find so many pop songs that focus on other topics than love. Pop music talks about self-esteem, strength, courage, optimism and overcoming obstacles, politics, social issues, etc. An example of this is Lily Allen's song \"URL Badman\" which combats hateful bloggers.\n\nPop makes you energetic and happy.\n\nPop music contains many songs that are fast-tempo and talk about believing in yourself. When you're having a bad day you listen to pop. When you're angry and need to feel better, you listen to an uplifting song, more likely a hip-hop song that's classified as pop. If you don't believe me check out this song.\n\nWhat is pop?\n\nThe absolute best thing about pop is that you can't pinpoint exactly what it is. There are so many musicians in the genre that are a big and famous talented acts to musicians that are underground and edgy innovators making pop music for fun. Musicians from Beyonce to Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, pop is a huge. It's creative and it's the best music genre on the planet.", "Thierry N'Doufou's three eldest children tumble out of the car; the little one trips over her school bag as she tries to work out what to do with her break-time snack.\n\n\"We continue to go to school here as we went to school 100 years ago,\" says the 36-year-old entrepreneur.\n\n\"The same heavy backpack, the same black board with the same chalk.\"\n\nAnd that heavy backpack is what Mr N'Doufou is hoping to lighten by introducing a bespoke tablet computer made specifically for schools in Ivory Coast.\n\nTwo years ago, he came up with Qelasy, Africa's first educational tablet. \"We thought about how to build a digital backpack; a tablet that will replace books, textbooks, notepads.\"\n\nThe idea is simple; transfer a country's entire education curriculum onto a digital format, along with sounds, animations and interactivity, and you no longer need a satchel crammed with school books.\n\nThe 36-year-old teamed up with a designer and then managed to find an investor to build a prototype.\n\nThis month his Qelasy tablet is going into schools for the first time. \"This is a day I've been waiting for.\" Mr N'Doufou says.\n\nThe Ivorian government will be introducing the tablets to 5,000 students in public schools, while some private schools in both Ivory Coast and Morocco will be running pilot projects.\n\nThey have also had interest from Ukraine, Macedonia, Senegal, Nigeria and France. \"My dream is to reach all the schools in the world for a better education,\" he says.\n\nThe tablets will also be available in shops at a cost of $232 (\u00a3143), before tax.\n\nQelasy's headquarters in an upmarket area of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city, are not quite Google but they are certainly impressive. There is a built in sound studio along with a 3D animation design suite, complete with the latest technology.\n\nIn the studio, two members of the team are busy recording the Ivorian children's book, \"Father Christmas loves attieke\", a traditional Ivorian dish.\n\n\"The idea is to make reading more fun, so we use funny voices and music,\" says Mr N'Doufou. \"We also do audio books because it helps children with the pronunciation.\"\n\nAt the weekly meeting Mr N'Doufou introduces the Qelasy team; \"the brightest technology brains in the area,\" he says. It's not hard to find tech savvy people in Abidjan; the Ivorian web community here is strong.\n\nPeople speak both French, the national language of Ivory Coast, as well as English. \"We're now looking to do an Arabic version because we want to reach Mauritania, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries,\" says Mr N'Doufou, adding they also want to do one in Spanish.\n\nThe team are discussing the details of the upcoming Qelasy launch. Their dream is for every classroom in Ivory Coast to be using Qelasy tablets.\n\n\"Children are struggling to get access to books,\" he says. \"With digital, schools in villages can access the best courses in the world.\"\n\nAt the moment the tablets are all made and assembled in China, but Qelasy's vision includes setting up a factory in Ivory Coast. \"It's our dream,\" says the entrepreneur.\n\n\"I'm passionate about education because I would like our country, our continent to take the place that it should have in the world and without education it's not possible.\"\n\nBack at Mr N'Doufou's children's school, some of the students are trying out Qelasy.\n\nThe entrepreneur stands at the front of the classroom demonstrating how the teacher would use the tablet.\n\n\"This tool is very easy. With one finger you can access almost anything,\" he says as he displays how he has complete control over every student's tablet, with the ability to see exactly what they are doing.\n\n\"I love the tablet because actually we can learn lots of things,\" says eight-year-old Olivera Daplet, who then goes on to read one of the online books out loud.\n\n\"I prefer Qelasy because it's lighter and we don't need a big bag,\" says Dominque Grah Thipourah, also eight, adding that it is the music and the animations she loves the most.\n\n\"For Ivory Coast to be an emerging country it must have children using technology,\" says school principal, Marie-Loure Kindo Assandoi, who's considering introducing Qelasy into her school next year.\n\n\"Technology is not the future,\" she says. \"It's already the present.\"", "SOME of Australia's most successful entrepreneurs, including Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes and Freelancer's Matt Barrie, will lift the lid on how they turned their digital start-ups into some of Australia's best-known technology companies at a new conference in Sydney this week.

Motion control? 1080p at 60 frames per second? They've got nothing on an infinite world full of vaguely 8-bit-looking blocks. With its purchase of Minecraft and the studio behind it, Microsoft isn't just buying a game; it's buying the heart of a generation.\n\nHere's everything Microsoft picked up today in its $2.5 billion Minecraft purchase. It's way more than just pixels.\n\nAsk a kid -- any kid -- about Minecraft, and you're almost sure to make an instant connection. It's the modern-day equivalent of greeting your nephew with a clumsy \"Mario twins\" reference. And adults are just as smitten. The combination of simple mechanics combined with virtually limitless depth makes Minecraft great for after-work play with old college friends and all-day summer vacation binges. There's a reason we all know its name.\n\nThe community of fandom around the game is staggeringly huge and multilayered. It's not just that there are tens of millions of fans of Minecraft itself. There are entire sprawling sub-communities based on the game's hundreds of utterly transformative mods. There are celebrity Minecraft players that post hundreds of hours of videos to YouTube, play together, and rub elbows with fans. Minecraft even has its own convention, one that Microsoft has already confirmed will continue after it absorbs the company that makes the game it honors.\n\nIt's a thriving community of enthusiastic builders and makers, the likes of which Microsoft hasn't seen in ages, if ever. And with Sony dominating the next-gen battlefield in part thanks to a super indie-game friendly outlook that could bring about whatever the next Minecraft might be, Microsoft needs some love of its own.\n\nIf you can't build a passionate fanbase around your products -- and let's face it, Office works just fine but doesn't stir many hearts -- you can always just buy one. And Microsoft just bought millions of the most passionate fans in the world.\n\nAnd of course what makes Minecraft great is that it's so much more than just a game. Even if you've got no love for spelunking through endless digital caverns, riding pigs, or slaying creepers, the simple block-by-block building that Minecraft refined and popularized is suited to all kinds of building. Minecraft isn't just a vehicle for the tech-inclined to build out 1KB hard drives; it's a format for building and experimenting and creating that's already inherently fun. Wiring up a skeleton slayer with redstone logic gates is infinitely more fun -- and arguably far more effective -- than reading through a coding tutorial. And kids are already doing it on their own, they just need a little nudge and some context.\n\nIt's a huge educational opportunity, one that Microsoft would be wise to exploit. Kids get to play Minecraft in school, and Microsoft gets to sponsor their squeals of joy, earning respect and recognition from young 'uns that will never have that sort of attachment to Windows 8 (or 9 or 10) or Microsoft Office.\n\nNot to mention that the classroom is a place where Microsoft desperately needs to catch up. Apple has its (troubled) plan to push iPads to the classroom. Amazon's Kindle Fires have kid-friendly modes built right in. Google's cramming Chromebooks in to computer labs. Microsoft, meanwhile, has its stalled-out Surface RT and little else to offer, short of setting schools up with Xbox Ones. Minecraft is a quick and easy way in, and crucially, it's one that's supported on virtually all of Microsoft's competitor's devices.\n\nAnd that's where the true value of Minecraft lays for Microsoft, the chance to gently attach itself to what's already the most transformative and wildly popular software in recent memory. Sure, the 50 million copies already sold aren't doing any good for Microsoft, but there's still room to grow, whether by (carefully) slicing off a piece of Minecraft's naturally occurring micro-transaction scene, pushing big licensing deals, or just watching the phenomenon that is Minecraft continue to soldier on.\n\nMicrosoft is at its heart a software company. But in a world where Google Docs and free OS X upgrades are closing in from all sides, selling the kind of software Microsoft traditionally has isn't nearly as easy as it used to be. Meanwhile, Minecraft sells like hot cakes on fire. $2.5 billion might sound like a lot to you and me, but as far as Microsoft is concerned it hardly registers. A few billion dollars is a small price to pay to own some of the world's best selling software in its totality. Especially when Minecraft is profitable enough that Microsoft should recoup its investment in just a few years.\n\nOf course the endgame needs to be more than just selling more copies of Minecraft, or Xbox consoles. The Minecraft community does't just love its game; it can be ferociously protective of it. And yes, Microsoft could hypothetically use this purchase as a cudgel and make \"Minecraft 2\" an Xbox One exclusive. But that would be at the cost of destroying the phenomenon that it just paid billions of dollars to purchase, and surely Microsoft knows that. Minecraft on iOS and Android and Playstation and OS X will continue to exist, and probably thrive; Microsoft is in the business of being all-encompassing.\n\nMinecraft isn't Candy Crush or Angry Birds. It's a thriving ecosystem, one inhabited by millions of people, spread across every generation. That's not something you can intentionally set out to build; it's something that happens through a mix of timing and competence and magic. Could Microsoft have built something like that internally? It could certainly have tried. But its success would have been subject to more stars aligning than it can afford. Minecraft, meanwhile, is a shortcut to the exact kind of success Microsoft needs right now.\n\nBy snapping up Minecraft at the peak of its popularity, Microsoft is getting the chance to reintroduce itself to millions upon millions of users in the comfort of the blocky wooden shacks they lovingly call home. And if it can avoid burning them down in the process, well, all the better.", "Governments of all sizes are demanding that Google hand over growing troves of data about its users, according to the Internet giant's latest transparency report. The report is a tally of all the times a government has used its legal authority to demand that Google hand over internal data about the people who use Google products like Gmail, YouTube or its namesake search engine.\n\nThis is the 10th time Google has released numbers on government data requests. Each time, the number of requests has risen sharply -- reflecting Google's growth as a company as well as governments' increasing use of the company's data in criminal investigations.\n\nThe roughly 32,000 requests Google fielded in the first six months of 2014 were up 15 percent from the previous six months, and up 150 percent since the company started publishing its transparency report in 2009. The growth was faster in the United States, with 19 percent growth in the first half of 2014 versus the previous six months, and up 250 percent since 2009.\n\nGoogle's transparency report - and its effort to shed light \"on how laws and policies affect Internet users and the flow of information online\" - has several portions to it. The one released Monday highlights the number of times a government demanded that Google hand over user information as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nThe data includes governments from around the world and of all sizes, including everything from small-town police departments to federal intelligence agencies. And, of course, Google doesn't always say yes: The company complied, in part or whole, about 65 percent of the time, according to the report.\n\n\"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs,\" wrote Richard Salgado, Google's legal director for law enforcement and information security, in a blog post. \"Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders.\"\n\nMr. Salgado voiced support for Senate legislation that would limit how the United States government collects data and how much it collects.\n\nAccording to Monday's report, nine countries demanded user data for the first time: Albania, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Indonesia, Kosovo, Luxembourg, Maldives, Namibia and Nepal.\n\nThe United States is far and away the most prolific in its demands, accounting for about 40 percent of the demands for user data. That is actually an undercount: Google is allowed to report only 1,000-increment ranges for certain United States national security requests.\n\n\"The biggest thing this report tells us is that the Justice Department is still trying to hide the ball about what the government is doing to get our data,\" said Nate Cardozo, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.", "NEW DELHI: Google and Indian handset partners Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, will launch more Android One devices over the next few months at price points above and below the Rs 6,399 mark, at which the quartet launched the first set of devices online on Monday.\n\nThe handset makers that together own about 30% of the local smartphone market, aim to sell hundreds of thousands of the lone model, even as Google, online partners - Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal - and the local device companies, undertake heavy marketing including television commercials to promote Android One.\n\n\"Going forward every brand will have a portfolio of devices, while specs may not be the same, even the targeted markets may not be the same,\" said Vineet Taneja, chief executive of Micromax which sells about 3 million mobile phones a month. \"We'll be selling lakhs of devices from a single model, which is very big,\" he added.\n\nAt the time of going to Press, Micromax's Android One devices had been sold out on Amazon. While Karbonn intends to launch two more Android One models by December, it will invest Rs 40-50 crore for promoting the Google-backed smartphone, which will begin selling through off line retailers by October, around Diwali.\n\n\"In the first quarter of 2015, we will introduce more models in the Android One range, which will be in the Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000 range,\" said Dilip Modi, chairman of Spice Mobility, a move which will be replicated by Karbonn which may also launch devices below the $100 mark.\n\nModi added that Spice will also sell Android devices through its AndroidLand chain of stores apart from Spice Hot Spots, which will be converted to Android One destination stores to educate customers.\n\nThe California-headquartered company is said to have set aside more than Rs 100 crore with its partners on advertising and marketing while the four companies will work harmoniously to cover online and offline marketing channels.\n\nWith inputs from Neha Alawadhi", "A bizarre crowd situation gave an otherwise solid show from Yacht an eerie feeling Sunday night at the Bluebird Theater. There was a shock walking in as openers White Fang were in full royal rumpus-mode but the floor was a ghost town. The unfortunately undersold show was the first on Yacht's current U.S. tour in which they're featuring new material.\n\nThe topography of the audience ended up being strange as well. More enthusiasm was clearly seen at the back of the house than the front, save a crushing male fan who tossed his panties on stage toward the end of the show. Claire Evans curiously lifted them up, and realizing the sweaty nature of her prize, tossed them back with a wide-eyed shock that turned into laughter and some light jabs at the fan.\n\nThe show was great, despite the mismatched venue/crowd size and energy. Playing as a four-piece, Jonah Bechtolt and Evans gave it everything they had. Swapping microphone duties and hip pumping dance moves, they pounded through an hour of heavy beats and synth with more vocals, bass, samples and drums from bandmates Rob Kieswetter and Jeffrey Brodsky. Although it would have been easier to let go and have fun at a small club, Yacht didn't mind at all. In fact they seemed to read the crowd as a more intimate opportunity than they would have had at capacity. The lights were as minimal as the stage decorations but the sound was nice and big.\n\nFans who sang along fervently found plenty to party with in the three news songs they played. These fans actually carved out a bunch of space in the middle and sides of the floor to seriously dance their asses off. The music/art/culture experiment of Yacht continues their road work for the next month and will certainly win over audiences of any makeup like they did in Denver on Sunday.\n\nFollow our news and updates on Twitter, our relationship status on Facebook and our search history on Google +.

And with no shortage of dissonance, clatter, shouting and plain old weirdness at the Meadowlark and Larimer Lounge on Saturday and Sunday, it was easy to experience something new. All weekend crowds swayed, nodded or wildly arm-danced along with 27 experimental artists.\n\nDVA provided the most crowd-pleasing show of the festival. It opened and ended with animal sounds made by the singer herself -- calm at the beginning, mad and wild to the end. In between, she alternated between lovely singing, sassy sax-playing and, for one song, spitfire talk-singing, all over peppy and crisp electronics and her bandmate's acoustic guitar. The songs were lively and playful, and the audience returned the energy.\n\nJust a few sets later, on the same stage, Los Angeles hip-hop trio Clipping was looking for a different energy from the crowd. Over beats that sometimes could have been the dizzying songs of another artist at the festival and other times would fit right in at a Detroit dance hall, Daveed Diggs delivered everything from slow, snarling screeds to sharp-tongued take-downs at blinding speed. He got down in the crowd to do it up close and personal, he instructed everyone to throw their middle fingers up and he led the room in a call in response. \"When I say 'dick in your' your say 'face.'\" During a festival that often featured musicians hunched over gear, this type of engagement was a welcome change.\n\nOn the opposite end of the energy spectrum were bigger names like Eric Copeland and Mount Eerie. Each played a set capable of lowering your heart rate and putting you in a trance. That sort of thing can feel too sleepy for a festival, but both musicians create something completely gorgeous, so it can be forgiven.\n\nSaturday's unofficial headliner, Wolf Eyes, was a trippy spectacle of heavy, low-tempo and grimey sounds under shouting. Earlier that night, during Trabajo, someone said, \"I feel like I'm gonna get probed.\" That sort of thing was common across both days. The sounds extracted from the piles of gear range from spacey and ambient, to gritty and aggressive, to bouncy and dance-ready. A band appropriately called Champion made poppy 8-bit music. Mezzanine Swimmers made something fun and somehow sunny with heavy beats and distorted-beyond-understanding\n\nvocals. Church Fire's charming melodies over industrial crashes were accompanied by some interpretive dancing and CP 208 featured William Wallin III screaming in his blonde wig, sheer blouse and flowy skirt.\n\nSo it's safe to say at least some part of all that was new or challenging to attendees. Goldrush may sometimes be preaching to the choir, but even the experimental music faithful can have their minds blown, or at least rattled and confused.\n\nFollow our news and updates on Twitter, our relationship status on Facebook and our search history on Google +.

Reuters/Irek Dorozanski\n\nGerman prosecutors are charging Oskar Groening, a 93-year-old former SS guard, with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role in operating the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, officials said Monday.\n\nGroening, born in 1921, is one of the last living SS members today. While he has admitted witnessing atrocities during the two and a half years he spent at Auschwitz, he maintains that he never committed any crimes there. Groening said he was mainly in charge of guarding the prisoners' possessions.\n\nGroening is being charged for his time as an Auschwitz guard between May and July 1944, during which an estimated 300,000 people, the vast majority of them Jews, were gassed. Around 1.1 million prisoners died while Auschwitz was in operation.\n\nProsecutors say Groening helped collect money from prisoners' belongings for the Nazis. \"He helped the Nazi regime benefit economically, and supported the systematic killings,\" lawyers said in a statement.\n\nThe charge against Groening is part of a renewed push by officials across Germany targeting 30 remaining former SS members who all worked at Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland. This renewed push to prosecute former death camp guards came after a precedent-setting ruling in the Munich trial of John Demjanjuk, a former camp guard who was convicted of crimes against humanity in 2011, which overrode the barrier of a statute of limitations on lower-ranking war criminals. Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian who lived for decades in the United States before being unmasked, died in 2012.\n\nInvestigators from Hanover in northwestern Germany, where Groening lives, had taken on three other cases of former SS members, but two were considered unfit for trial, while the third died. In March, Groening was formally declared to be healthy and fit to stand trial.\n\nThomas Walther, a lawyer representing 20 Auschwitz victims and their relatives in the case against Groening, told the Associated Press that the charges represent a last chance for \"justice to one of the SS men who had a part in the murder of their closest relatives.\"\n\nShare this article Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google + More", "Franck Rib\u00e9ry has returned from injury in time for Bayern Munich's Champions League clash with Manchester City. Reuters\n\nNow familiar foes Bayern Munich and Manchester City kick off their Champions League campaigns with a heavyweight clash at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. Having never previously met in a competitive match, the sides will now be facing off in the group phase for the third time in four seasons.\n\nThe frequency of those meetings is a testament to Manchester City's rapid rise, but also their struggles to break into the true European elite. Last season was the first in which City succeeded in getting out of the group phase, but even a 3-2 win at the Allianz Arena wasn't enough to ensure top spot in their group and a more favorable draw in the last 16. In their first ever knockout tie in Europe's top competition, the might of Barcelona were the opponents and City were sent packing. While the club has now won two Premier League titles in three seasons to establish themselves as a true force at home, the club's mega-rich Abu Dhabi owners now surely crave the prestige and notoriety of being a regular at the sharp end of the Champions League and, indeed, taking home the most prestigious trophy in club soccer.\n\nBut before they can think about doing that, Manchester City will again have to negotiate a treacherous group. Not only must they face Bayern, the champions of 2013, but also a rejuvenated Roma side, which finished second in Serie A last season. Two matches against Bayern will not just be chances to show that they can now mix it with Europe's best, but potentially pivotal opportunities to gain points.\n\nWhen the two sides met at the Etihad last October, City looked very much the European novices up against continental heavyweights. In truth, a 3-1 defeat flattered the hosts as Manuel Pellegrini got his tactics badly wrong in his first real European test since taking charge. The decision to go with two strikers on that occasion left City horribly open and Bayern, in the early days of Pep Guardiola, looked a good bet to become the first team to retain the European Cup in the Champions League era.\n\nA similar scenario appeared on the cards in Munich in December. Bayern led 2-0 in a game to decide which team would progress to the last 16 as group winners. But City, this time with a reinforced midfield and just one striker, rebounded superbly and a 3-2 win was only tarnished by the fact that, unbeknownst to Pellegrini, they needed just one more goal to take top spot.\n\nHaving sold Alvaro Negredo on transfer deadline day and with Stevan Jovetic disappointingly injured once more after a fine start to the season, it seems highly likely that Pellegrini will opt just one striker when City return to the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. The Chilean has suffered a blow, though, with the man brought in this summer to shore up the midfield, Fernando, ruled out through injury. Without the former Porto player, as well as Yaya Toure, on Saturday, City struggled to control the midfield and could only draw 2-2 with Arsenal. Although Fernando remains absent, Toure should return to take the place of Frank Lampard alongside Fernandinho.\n\nLast December, few read much into what was just Bayern's third defeat of 2013.Yet it turned into a precursor for the defensive failings that would be briefly shown up by Arsenal and Manchester United and then crudely exposed by Real Madrid in an emphatic defeat for the holders in the semifinals. While City may still need to prove themselves on the European stage, Bayern will be eager to show that they have put that major disappointment behind them.\n\nOne of Guardiola's plans to overcome that vulnerability was apparently to switch to a three-man backline. That idea, however, was quickly undermined by a serious knee injury to Javi Martinez. And their defensive options have now been weakened further by yet another injury cruelly suffered by Holger Badstuber, who had just returned after more than 18 months out injured. It could mean that, against Manchester City, there will be a first appearance in a Bayern shirt for the man signed from Roma last month, Mehdi Benatia.\n\nAnother late-transfer-window arrival Xabi Alonso has already settled seamlessly into the heart of the Bayern team and played a starring role in a 2-0 win over Stuttgart on Saturday. His early performances are a particular boon to Guardiola, given that he is without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thiago Alcantara and Rafinha through injury. Arjen Robben is also a doubt for Wednesday, although Franck Rib\u00e9ry made his return from injury and marked it with the second goal against Stuttgart.\n\nPrediction: Neither side has enjoyed an ideal start to the season, and also have key injuries. Bayern appear to still be struggling with something of a World Cup hangover, while City, too, have been impacted by the tournament in Brazil, with Sergio Aguero still not up to full speed. Wednesday's clash then may not be the best of indicators for how each will fare in Europe going forward this season. City should certainly be competitive, with David Silva in fine form and likely to be handed a central playmaking role. Behind him, though, the loss of Fernando to balance the attacking instincts of Toure is a significant loss. Bayern, with their incredible strength in depth, may just emerge with a narrow win.\n\nBayern Munich 2-1 Manchester City\n\nKickoff time: 2.45 p.m. EDT\n\nTV channel: Fox Sports 1\n\nLive stream: Fox Sports Go, Fox Soccer 2Go (via free trial)\n\nShare this article Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google + More", "We still have plenty of questions about Apple's recently announced smartwatch, but following the leak of dozens of private celebrity photos from the iCloud, privacy is a primary concern.

This may include such things as best practices for updating open-source software, ways of securing legal compliance, or tools and habits for making software that is freely available to anyone.\n\nOpen source is a popular approach to software, in which anyone can contribute to and use the code. Formal approval of changes comes from agreed-upon authorities who speak for the group. It is considered a good way to build software with fewer bugs, and such software makes up much of the world's mobile and computer server operating systems, as well as many other applications.\n\n\"There is a problem here we all feel is not getting better anytime soon,\" said Jay Parikh, global head of engineering at Facebook. \"We feel there is a speed at which things have to move.\"\n\nAt first blush, the effort might seem like the further corporate control of one of the most important technologies of this era. That may be so, but it is more importantly a sign of just how critical that technology has become, and how its growing importance needs to be managed in ways that are more expedient, clear and consistent than was possible in the movement's early days.\n\nMembers of TODO, which stands for \"talk openly, develop openly,\" include Google and Walmart's online operations, along with GitHub, the primary repository for working on open-source projects, and Khan Academy, a nonprofit online educational organization. Other members are Twitter, Box, Dropbox, Stripe and Square.\n\nSince the group was announced, over 30 other companies have added themselves to the TODO list, including The New York Times, according to a company spokesman.\n\nThere is a reason for setting up a group like this. A significant part of the software that powers things like Facebook, Google search and the Android mobile operating system is based on open source. As more companies and independent developers get involved in these communal projects, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep straight which versions people are working on.\n\nFacebook, for example, may release new parts of its software twice a day, far faster than the pace at which open-source releases came out in their earliest mainframe computing days, and with far more participants creating and consuming open-source software in the client-server computing era of 20 years ago.\n\nAs the software inside the overall system of mobile phones, tablets, applications and remote computing infrastructure becomes even more complex, there are also worries that people working on different versions will cause breakdowns.\n\nIn a statement on his company's website, Sam Schillace, the head of engineering at Box, said the group was \"committed to helping companies develop a common set of tools and streamlined processes for releasing open source software.\"\n\nWhile the goal may be to move quickly, the organization also showed a certain initial wariness, perhaps as befits a group with members who might also wish to crush one another in the marketplace. Mr. Parikh was hesitant to talk about what types of code the group would work on, or what the criteria might be for other companies to join, besides having dedicated open-source teams on staff.\n\n\"We're going to get together, get things into a plan,\" he said. \"This is going to be a journey.\"", "The Center for an Urban Future studied all the library systems in the five boroughs. They said many Queens library buildings are 'Lindsay boxes' built during the late Mayor's tenure and are too small for the large number of people who use them now.\n\nBranch libraries in Queens are too small to keep up with the growing demand for their services, according to a new report by the Center for an Urban Future.\n\nQueens has 41 library branches that are under 10,000 square-feet, the largest number in all five boroughs.\n\nHundreds of thousands of customers have come to rely on the libraries for their English language and immigrant assistance programs, as well as job hunting resources and as places to do schoolwork.\n\n\"The Queens Library really struggles to provide full services,\" said David Giles, the study's author. \"But the dominant prototype were these shoebox style branches that are about 7,500 square-feet.\n\nThe so-called \"Lindsay boxes\" were built in the 1960s and early 70s during Mayor Lindsay's tenure. The library has renovated and updated many of its branches in recent years, but in only a few instances -- such as Elmhurst -- is it rebuilding from scratch.\n\nThe think tank is asking the de Blasio Administration to provide capital funds for the Queens, Brooklyn and New York Public Library systems so they can better plan and meet their maintenance and expansion needs.\n\n\"Libraries receive almost 60% of their funding through the discretionary programs, so every year they have to go hat in hand to the borough presidents and City Council members,\" Giles said. \"No other agency works like that.\"\n\nQueens Library officials said they are in the midst of a capital improvement program that has already renovated more than half its libraries. Still, the needs far outweigh the current funding, they said.\n\nGiles said he was stunned to find out the lack of electrical outlets at libraries around the city, despite the fact that so many patrons need them for laptops and tablets.\n\nHe said 58% percent of the libraries CUF researchers surveyed had fewer than 10 places for electronics users to plug in.\n\nlcolangelo@nydailynews.com\n\nRelated Stories Queens Library will offer universal pre-K classes Google tablets will soon be available for loan at all Queens Library branches Queens Library lures teens with a space of their own", "I'm easing back into this weekly Else column, or put another way, I missed last week's Else due to preparations for NewCo SF, which I'm proud to say was a huge success.

It's the building block to any platform-building. You should be collecting emails before you even build the blog or write the book. I Wish I did it this way to begin with.\n\nWhy?\n\nCollecting emails has got to be the fastest, easiest, cheapest way to build a community. You can approach someone and more likely get their email than a \"like\" on Facebook. Email is about discovery. Facebook is about liking what we already like.\n\nYou know this though. You know that email is the way to build your online presence. You know the benefits and have heard it plenty of times. But like anything though, everything has it challenges.\n\nYou've probably read the \"8 Reasons Why Your Email Open Rate is Nosediving\" that I wrote for Problogger a while back. These points listed within that post will give you insight on how to format those emails. It was mostly about format, and how Google sees your email campaign.\n\nEither as spammy or as friend, you're one or the other with Google.\n\nToday isn't about the technical side of things though, it's about your performance in content. You can do all the things mentioned in the previous post, as formatting goes, and still miss potential readers and customers because the content was horrible.\n\nOkay, so you have these challenges looking at you like a ban of ugly monsters and not sure how to tackle them. You've tried everything and no one wants to join your email list, your open rates are low, and the few that have joined are unsubscribing just weeks after joining.\n\nI want to solve this for you. If you focus on this one thing, it will make your email list explode, Connecting with Quality Information.\n\nLet's think about this for a second. What's in it for them when they join your list? If you think they're joining so you can punch them every week with a pitch, you're wrong.\n\nYou've got to offer benefits. Make them feel part of a secret club. People love feeling like they're \"in\", you know? To feel connected with someone they look up to is one reason why they join.\n\nHere are some other things you could be offering to your list:\n\nMake sure every time you send out an email it gives them a feeling. A good feeling. A feeling of hope, inspiration, and success. An email, that when they're done, makes them feel like they've walked away with something valuable. Don't just send an email that reminds them you're still alive. It should never be like that. Send an email that is worth a lot and makes that reader a raving fan. If that means one email instead of two a week, then let it be. How To Find CONTENT For You To Write About is a great post if you're stuck on how to create more valuable content.\n\nYou remember all those benefits I mentioned in the first section? List it on the signup page. Make it feel like a free membership with benefits, because if there is no benefits, you're not getting many subscribers. Advertise the benefits on that page creatively.\n\nBut on top of that offer something that is enticing to new people who haven't experienced those other things yet. Offer a product, service, ebook etc, that you know is something they would crave. Something that would make them sign up today! Make sure it's relative to what you do. Offering an iPad is not a good idea by the way.\n\nThen start a contest and offer this prize. Your list will grow quickly, but understand it takes a lot of energy and can't be done too often. You'll lose the buzz.\n\nMake your email list about connectivity. Offer your list more availability than anywhere else. I don't care if you have 100k readers on your list, answer every email in a timely manner. This is a major problem in the blogging world. You can email most bloggers, and you're lucky to get a reply. The ones making the money though, many of those will.\n\nIs there a connection? Yes.\n\nI'm not saying all millionaire bloggers respond to email, because they don't, but more of them will. It's why they're making money, they respond to every question or at least most.\n\nWhy? You never know where this conversation could be going.\n\nBesides, you should want to reply. It's exciting! To think, someone is reaching out to you and wanting to hear from you. It should thrill you. When you get to the point that you feel like your readers are a nuisance though... You won't be in business for long. So make it #1 priority and answer every email.\n\nApply these and your list will grow within time. Hope you have walked away with some fresh ideas and spark some more creativity within your tribe.\n\nDid I forget something? Comment below with your ideas on how to build your list and beat the email challenges.", "SAN FRANCISCO: Google on Monday (Sep 15) launched a US$105 smartphone in India, taking aim at emerging markets as part of an initiative called Android One.\n\n\"With Android One, we not only want to help people get online, we want to make sure that when they get there, they can tap into the wealth of information and knowledge the Web holds for everyone,\" said Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe smartphone was available in major shops in India starting at 6,399 rupees (US$105).\n\nCalifornia-based Google announced new Android One partnerships with an array of handset makers including Acer, ASUS, HTC, and Lenovo, saying that the variety of low-cost Android One smartphones should expand.\n\nAndroid One smartphones should be available in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines by the end of this year, according to Pichai.\n\nThe smartphones will have ample processing power, along with high-quality cameras, according to Google, which promised to keep the operating software up to date remotely. Features expected to particularly appeal to the India market included replaceable batteries, built-in FM radio, and dual SIM cards.\n\nWith the Android One debut, Google is following through on an announcement made at its annual developers conference in San Francisco in June.\n\nGoogle is working with carriers in India to provide affordable telecom service packages to go with the smartphones, which could in many cases provide Internet access for the first time.\n\nThe Android One initiative sets out to work with smartphone makers and others in the \"ecosystem\" to pool resources and standardize hardware platforms to provide \"turnkey solutions\" for making handsets, according to Pichai.\n\nGoogle and Silicon Valley rival Facebook have made priorities out of connecting with people in parts of the world where Internet connectivity is scant, unreliable or just non-existent.\n\nHaving more people tune into websites or services mean expanded opportunities to make money from online advertising or providing tools that connect shops with customers.\n\nGoogle does not make money from hardware, with its own branded gadgets meant to set standards and show off software capabilities with an eye toward inspiring electronics manufacturers to raise their games when it comes to Android or Chrome devices.\n\nDeveloping countries have become prime targets for smartphone makers, and Android software made available free to handset makers has proven to be popular with budget-conscious buyers.", "Despite earlier reports, HTC still plans to make a smartwatch, and will release it early next year.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that HTC had canned its plans for a wearable device because it thought the competition was too fierce.\n\nSources tell CNET that HTC \"aims to stand out from the crowd\". How does it intend to do this? With \"elements of design, which is what the company is known for, as well as features that consumers will more immediately gravitate toward\".\n\nThat's not exactly concrete detail, but it certainly sounds enticing.\n\nHTC is holding an event in New York on October 8, but one source says it won't announce its smartwatch there.\n\nSamsung has so far launched six smartwatches, and all the major players including LG and Motorola have unveiled their own techy timepieces. But it was the Apple Watch, announced on Tuesday night, that really set tongues wagging.\n\nHTC's device is believed to run Android Wear, Google's operating system that's optimised for wearable devices. Though it's believed to have customised it, like it did with its Sense UI on Android.\n\nThe smartwatch wars are hotting up, especially now Apple has entered the fray. So far, a lot of the Android Wear devices have been too samey to stand out, so hopefully HTC can offer something different. It has won plaudits for the design of the HTC One (M8), so who knows, it could have a premium timepiece up its sleeve.\n\nSource: CNET", "With high-profile hacks exposing the futility of passwords, alternatives such as biometric identification and two-step verification are gaining popularity.\n\nWaiting in the wings is a login network that could grant users access to many of their Internet accounts with a single registration.\n\nThe National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace is the planning ground for this system, where users will not have to release personal information or create new passwords to log on to multiple websites. A \"trusted\" third-party -- such as Verizon or PayPal -- would register your personal information once to create a password, fingerprint scan or other account-login mechanism. Each time you wanted to sign in to H&R Block or another online vendor, for example, you would enter that same ID.\n\nThe vision is not expected to be fully realized until after 2020. But one part of the network is slated to debut as early as next month, NSTIC head Jeremy Grant told Nextgov.\n\nConnect.gov Launches at VA, but not IRS -- Yet\n\nThe U.S. government's piece of the ecosystem will be called Connect.gov, a login screen for citizens that ultimately will pop up on every secured federal form and website, according to agency planners. The name of the new initiative has not been publicly announced. The tool, ultimately, will validate credentials from a variety of approved ID providers, such as Google.\n\nConnect.gov \"is going to launch with a few key anchor agencies that will be testing it out in the first round,\" including the Department of Veterans Affairs, Grant said. The IRS, one of the most high-traffic federal sites, will not use the security system. A big wave of other agencies is expected follow within the next 18 to 24 months, he said.\n\n\"The goal from the White House is that this quickly grows into a governmentwide shared service that all agencies are using -- across all government sites,\" Grant said of Connect.gov. \"It's basically production ready right now and agencies are doing integration testing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service will operate the backbone of the tool -- currently named the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange. It's a piece of infrastructure that will allow agencies to tap a large assortment of credentials managed by the ID providers.\n\nThe General Services Administration is handling contracts between the vendors and agencies.\n\nThe exchange will allow agencies to access digital credentials for various levels of ID security \"through a common platform so they can provide a wide range of services and applications to citizens,\" GSA spokeswoman Jackeline Stewart said in an email. \"VA is just one agency using the program for their applications.\"\n\nShe said more information on features will be released \"when we launch later this year.\"\n\nThe IRS supports the concept of the exchange and plans to incorporate it \"in the coming years,\" the tax agency told Nextgov in a statement. \"It is important to note that reductions in IRS' budget\" -- a total of $850 million since 2010 - \"have stretched IT and other resources across the agency.\"\n\nNIST Faces New Questions After NSA Encryption Revelations\n\nThe long-term NSTIC approach is being guided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The government affiliation has raised questions about the program's integrity, however. The National Security Agency reportedly pressured NIST into weakening a widely used cryptographic standard so NSA could break into private communications, a revelation that cast NIST as an accomplice to NSA surveillance. And it did nothing to quell criticism that NSTIC might become a big brother national ID card recording a citizen's every point and click.\n\nGrant, who is the NIST senior executive adviser for ID management, acknowledges he has received more questions about the government's participation in NSTIC in recent months. But he insists it is a nonissue among the initiative's diverse industry partners.\n\nFor starters, the program's private sector-led steering group consists of entities often considered adversaries in the online privacy debate -- AARP, LexisNexis, Microsoft and both the American Civil Liberties Union and NSA. The steering group will soon be spun off into a nonprofit, according to members.\n\n\"Despite the concerns and the outrage over some of the other stories coming out, by and large, the folks that we've been working with recognize that NSTIC is a strategy,\" Grant said. \"It calls on the private sector to help develop something, and the government actually doesn't have control here. We're not building any new system. We're not trying to set up a central database.\"\n\nHe says the outcome of the project will be the opposite of snooping. \"Any time the government's involved in these things [people] may have concerns, but they are also excited about what we are trying to do, which is partnering with the private sector to ultimately deliver better privacy and security,\" Grant said.\n\nWider Acceptance Could Take Years\n\nNIST, Connect.gov, the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange and NSTIC will not store any personal information. The government is not running NSTIC, but rather arranging meetings and small grants for the companies that manage the technology, Grant said.\n\nNSTIC, for example, awarded $2.8 million to credential-creator ID.me. As a result, a retired military member now can register online for a single ID.me login -- and then sign in to any of a number of sites that offer discounts on Uber car rides, free shipping at Overstock.com and other perks.\n\n\"That same credential, once the Federal Cloud Credential Exchange goes live, should also be able to be used at the Department of Veterans Affairs to log into the My HealtheVet.gov portal -- and download health information,\" Grant said.\n\nThe steering group is expected to announce additional grants and pilot programs later this week.\n\nID.me officials say their user-base will reach 2 million people by the end of 2014.\n\nStill, ID.me, PayPal, and other outside logins are not anticipated to be widely accepted for years, because compatibility will require a new regime of security standards, liability policies and business rules.\n\nThe actual tools are the least of the holdups.\n\n\"There is no shortage of technologies, but if most of the businesses I'm dealing with online aren't going to actually allow me to use it when I log in, then it's not really worth anything to me,\" Grant said.\n\nFor example, will Apple and Amazon let users log into their apps with a Google ID?\n\nSome Legal Questions Remain Unresolved\n\nAside from branding issues, there are legal questions. \"What happens if something's compromised and something's lost?\" Grant said. \"Who is actually liable? A lot of things can be addressed through standard contract terms.\"\n\nHe compares the online login system to the traditional payment card system.\n\n\"I've got two VISA cards in my wallet. One from U.S. Bank. One from Chase,\" Grant explained. \"If I go down to the Starbucks around the corner and buy a cup of coffee, they could care less which card I present, because both of them have the VISA logo on it. And it's not just a shiny logo. It's a 'trust mark' that stands for a whole bunch of standards and operating rules behind the scenes that govern everything from how the card is produced in a secure environment, how it's authenticated at the point of sale . . . how many days it will take for Starbucks to get paid by the bank.\"\n\nThe login system, like the payment system at Target and any other networked system, is bound to be hacked at some point. The unresolved issue for the ID strategy is who becomes responsible for losses.\n\nWith payment systems, there are \"rules in place that allocate liability between the consumer, the merchant and the issuing bank,\" Grant said. \"We don't have anything that's like that for online credentialing\" -- yet.", "Google's senior vice-president Sundar Pichai, considered to be next in line for the top job at the internet giant, spoke to ET on Google's vision for the world and India. Edited excerpts:\n\nFrom driverless cars to Google Glass, Google seems to be into a lot of things. How do you describe Google now?\n\nWe have always been keen to use technology and computer science to work on problems which can have a big impact on lots of people in their day-today lives. That's the framework by which I have thought of Google. I think the problems are ambitious and will have a lot of impact on people. And it is hard, that's what Google is about.\n\nAre any of these moonshots for emerging markets?\n\nYes definitely.

As we think about problems, we are willing to look across the world and there is no goal of looking at developing markets or developed markets alone.\n\nWhen I think about stuff like self-driving cars, we are pushing in so many areas of computer science, engineering together in an aggressive way. I think a lot can come out of it, which can benefit something outside of self-driving cars in places like India.\n\nWhat are the next big things we can expect from Google and you?\n\nIt is a difficult question because in some ways we focus on building platforms. When you build a platform what happens at the top of it is serendipitous and the unpredictable but it is always powerful.\n\nI think we have gone through a stage in computing where a lot of computing has just been about automating what you do in your real life. The whole PC journey was all about automating or creating a virtual space. Today, an application like calendar would need manual entry.\n\nBut I think few years from now it will be different. We will do more meaningful things, you will see hints of it in products like Google Now.\n\nDo you see potential for Loon in India?\n\nI think it (Loon) will make sense for certain rural places in India. It is pretty exciting to see all the carriers offer connectivity in India in a 3G and a 4G side. But you know you are not going to reach every part of India specially rural parts of India where you don't have the density etc or it is far away from metros. And I think Loon could play a role there.\n\nShould we expect something soon?\n\nThe way we have structured the projects like Loon and self-driving cars is that they have a lot of autonomy. They are in their corner working very hard.\n\nI would say we have deployed these balloons and obviously, we are testing them out and the science behind them are fascinating to see. So, I do think we would see some real project with a lot of right kind of people behind it.", "\"We are now living in what we might as well admit is the Age of Iraq,\" New York Times op-ed columnist David Brooks recently wrote. There, in the Land of the Two Rivers, he continued, the United States confronts the \"core problem\" of our era - \"the interaction between failing secular governance and radical Islam.\"\n\nBrooks is wrong. For starters, he misconstrues the core problem - which is a global conflict pitting tradition against modernity.\n\nTraditionalists, especially numerous in but not confined to the Islamic world, cling to the conviction that human existence should be God-centered human order. Proponents of modernity, taking their cues from secularized Western elites, strongly prefer an order that favors individual autonomy and marginalizes God. Not God first, but we first - our own aspirations, desires and ambitions. If there's a core problem afflicting global politics today, that's it.\n\nThis conflict did not originate in nor does it emanate from Iraq. So to say that we live in the Age of Iraq is the equivalent of saying we live in the Age of Taylor Swift or the Age of Google. The characterization serves chiefly to distract attention from more important matters.\n\nTo the limited extent that we do live in the Age of Iraq, it's because successive U.S. presidents have fastened on that benighted country as a place to demonstrate the implacable onward march of modernity.\n\nFor the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 - the interval between Operation Desert Storm and the final withdrawal of U.S. forces after a lengthy occupation of Iraq - Washington policymakers, Republican and Democratic, relied on various forms of coercion to align Iraq with American expectations of how a country ought to run.\n\nThe effort failed abysmally.\n\nNow here is Barack Obama, elected president in 2008 largely because he promised to end the Iraq war, back for another bite at the apple. A small bite - since Obama's aversion to large-scale intervention on the ground will largely restrict the U.S. effort to aerial bombardment supplemented with a bit of advice and equipment.\n\nWhether the president will make good his promise to \"degrade and ultimately defeat\" Islamic State militants will depend less on the accuracy of U.S. bombs and missiles than on the effectiveness and motivation of surrogate forces fighting on the ground. Identifying willing and able proxies is likely to pose a challenge.\n\nThe Iraqi security forces, created by the United States at such great cost, have shown neither fight nor skill. Though the Kurdish peshmerga have a better reputation, their primary mission is to defend Kurdistan, not to purge Iraq as a whole of invaders. The Syrian army is otherwise occupied and politically toxic.\n\nThe countries that ought to care more than the United States simply because they are more immediately threatened by Islamic State fighters - Iran, Turkey, Egypt and even Saudi Arabia - have not demonstrated a commensurate willingness to act.\n\nThe best hope of success may lie in the possibility that Islamic State militants will overplay their hand - their vile and vicious tactics alienating erstwhile collaborators and allies, much as the behavior of al-Qaida in Iraq alienated Sunni warlords during the famous U.S. surge of 2007-2008.\n\nThis much is certain, however: Even if Obama cobbles together a plan to destroy the Islamic State, the problems bedeviling the Persian Gulf and the greater Middle East more broadly won't be going away anytime soon.\n\nDestroying what Obama calls the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant won't create an effective and legitimate Iraqi state. It won't restore the possibility of a democratic Egypt. It won't dissuade Saudi Arabia from funding jihadists. It won't pull Libya back from the brink of anarchy. It won't end the Syrian civil war. It won't bring peace and harmony to Somalia and Yemen. It won't persuade the Taliban to lay down their arms in Afghanistan. It won't end the perpetual crisis of Pakistan. It certainly won't resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAll the military power in the world won't solve those problems. Obama knows that. Yet he is allowing himself to be drawn back into the very war that he once correctly denounced as stupid and unnecessary - mostly because he and his advisers don't know what else to do. Bombing has become his administration's default option.\n\nRudderless and without a compass, the American ship of state continues to drift, guns blazing.\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2014.

At the time, LG only said that the G3 Stylus would begin rolling out in September, but today the Life's Good crew has gotten a bit more specific.\n\nThe LG G3 Stylus will launch in Brazil this week, with releases in Latin America, Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (Russia, Belarus, Uzbekistan and more) shortly thereafter. As a quick refresher, here are the specs that this pen-toting handset packs:\n\nLG isn't talking price, saying that those details will be announced in each market at launch. Because the LG G3 Stylus's spec list isn't what most folks would consider \"bleeding edge,\" I'm betting that it won't be too hard on your wallet. If that is indeed the case, the G3 Stylus could be an interesting device since it could offer a Samsung Galaxy Note-like experience (big screen, included stylus) for a price that'd likely be easier on the wallet.\n\nWill you check out the LG G3 Stylus if it becomes available in your country?", "\"We've lost more Americans on the highways than we've lost in all the wars that we've ever fought,\" says Jim Hall, the former head of the National Transportation Safety Board in a new video from the New York Times.\n\nThe big push in the 1960s automobile world was about the sexiness and features of the car, Hall recalls, and none of the emphasis was on safety like the then-high-tech safety device known as the air bag.\n\nThe Times' excellent Retro Report series takes a look at the history of the air bag but also examines the possible futures of driverless cars. The autonomous automobile is just another step in the long historical arc of people trying to make cars safer. But the video raises questions about various ways in which today's cars can be hacked and how it's pretty much only going to get worse in the future.\n\nAre we ready to surrender control of our cars to robots in the name of security? What are the trade-offs we're willing to accept as motorists? The tech and auto companies, of course, are pretty sure that their recent efforts (despite all the recalls and negative publicity) will make driving on America's roads much safer.\n\n\"Imagine never losing someone to a traffic accident ever again,\" says a Google engineer in voiceover. \"This is a huge opportunity to save lives and make the world a better place.\"\n\nBack in the 1990s, the promise of the self-driving car was one of safety. In fact, in 1991 Congress authorized $650 million to be spent on developing an automated highway system -- something not mentioned in the video, and never fully realized. Will this time around be any different? Will driverless cars bring about the utopia that so many are predicting? I suppose we'll just have to wait and find out.\n\nIn the meantime, you can watch the entire Retro Report video above, or read more at the New York Times.", "More than 2.5 million people have been affected by what is seen as the worst flooding in more than a century in the Kashmir Valley, with close to 300 deaths, following record monsoon rains.\n\nAlthough the floodwaters have receded in the past two days, the Indian and Pakistani sides of the disputed region are at risk of waterborne diseases, local medical personnel warned on Monday.\n\nHospitals were also underwater and doctors were facing a shortage of medicine and surgical equipment as they tried to provide emergency help in makeshift medical centers.\n\nGoogle map of Srinagar, in the Kashmir valley, before and after after flood waters of Sept., 2014.

(Learn more at: http://google.com/wallet)\n\nApple Pay is initially focusing on the Touch ID fingerprint recognition combined with NFC in the new iPhone 6 & 6 Plus which generates a one-time use code that the merchant accepts as payment.\n\nOnce again, your credit card information is not shared with the merchant or stored anywhere (not even on your phone), so your exposure is dramatically reduced. (Learn more at: http://apple.com/apple-pay)\n\nMobile payment systems are far from perfected or more importantly widely supported just yet, but I encourage everyone to keep an open mind as they become available.

So, I've been looking forward to doing a new Tweetbag for a while, and here we are again, starting the week the right way, with your questions. To get an answer here, just go on Twitter and use the #AskSpector hashtag. For now, let's get on to the questions we've got, and have a little fun.\n\n@jessespector #AskSpector The Red Sox recently said they were going to spend big this off season. Who do you see as their targets? -- The Snorting Bull (@TheSnortingBull)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nThe only big-name position player who really makes a lot of sense for the Red Sox on the prospective free agent market is Nelson Cruz, to come in, play left field, and get really familiar with the Green Monster while blasting plenty of balls over it with his bat. Boston could then get Yoenis Cespedes' arm into right field, and presumably put a healthy-again Shane Victorino in center.\n\nCould you go for Hanley Ramirez, put him on the left side of the infield with Xander Bogaerts, and cut bait on Will Middlebrooks? Yes, but it might not be the best idea, and doesn't seem that likely to happen anyway. Maybe Russell Martin? But the Red Sox have big-time catching prospects.\n\nMost likely, the Red Sox will be looking to spend big on pitching, whether that means bringing back Jon Lester or going after Max Scherzer, maybe while also adding Ervin Santana or James Shields. How would Brandon McCarthy look in a Boston uniform? But then, these all are pitchers on the wrong side of 30 who will be looking for long-term deals. Is Boston really up for that?\n\nKeep in mind that spending big does not necessarily mean on the free agent market. If Boston can get valuable players in trades, the chips are there to make it happen, and the ability to absorb salary can help a lot to get deals done. Exactly who will be available on the trade market very much remains to be seen.\n\n@jessespector which of baseball's unwritten rules irk you most, and with which are you on board? -- Jennifer Cosey (@VivaTigres)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI very much dislike anything that uses tradition as a justification for throwing baseballs at people in excess of 90 miles per hour. Even if you're aiming for the back, you can easily hit the head, and it's injecting danger into the game for no reason. I find most unwritten rules stupid, because there are enough written ones, and because it's about saving face for opponents in professional sports, which to me is silly. I am, however, on board with pitchers who get upset at batters who take too long to get into the box.\n\n@jessespector Should Jenrry Mejia organise for fireworks to go off on the mound very time he gets a Strikeout? -- Frazer Loveman (@FSGLoveman)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI wish he would. The Mets telling Mejia to tone down his act was annoying to me. The man's job is to close out victories for his team. You're supposed to be excited about winning, and the guys on the other team are supposed to be professionals who can handle losing. If they can't, who cares about hurting their delicate feelings? People complain that baseball is boring, then complain about players being emotional about it. Can't have it both ways.\n\n@jessespector tweeted this before, but I want Ichiro on the Astros playing for 3000. He could teach Altuve a lot, and vice versa #askspector -- Ryan Suhl (@suhlnichi)\n\nSeptember 9, 2014\n\nThis is not so much a question as an opinion, and I'm curious as to what Jose Altuve could teach Ichiro. I don't think it's a terrible idea for Ichiro to go to Houston, although I don't know if he would really want to go there. If Ichiro sticks around, his best fit is as a part-time player -- the times this year when he has been pressed into everyday service for the Yankees have been a disaster, but when he's playing a couple of times a week, he's pretty good. As a fourth outfielder, he still gives you a strong outfield arm, OK speed, and the ability to hit his way on base. He'll be 41 next season, so you can understand why playing every day is not the best idea. I would think that he would want to be with a team with a good chance at winning the World Series, and probably to stay in the American League for familiarity's sake. Heading back to Seattle would be a pretty decent option, all things considered.\n\n@jessespector #AskSpector How is Robinson Cano not the leading AL MVP candidate? He transformed the Mariners. -- Kevin Fitzgerald (@KJF1tz)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nIt could have something to do with the fact that the best player in baseball plays for the first-place team in Cano's division. I'd also argue that Cano is not the MVP of his own team -- it's Felix Hernandez. If you don't want to have that argument, I'll challenge the notion that Cano has transformed the Mariners, as you say. They are 11th in the American League in scoring, up only one spot in the rankings from last year. Seattle's team ERA was 4.31 last year, and this year it's 3.00. Unless Cano has been secretly pitching, he hasn't transformed a thing about that team.\n\n@jessespector #AskSpector do you think the Jays stand a chance in the wildcard race, or will I have my heart broken? -- Richard Lee-Sam (@RLeesam)\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\nThey still stand a chance, yes, but you're going to have your heart broken.\n\n@jessespector why does Ned Yost hate me? #askspector -- J.R. Lind (@jrlind)\n\nSeptember 10, 2014\n\nWithout having the opportunity to directly ask Yost about his feelings about you, I am unable to confirm that he does, in fact, hate you. If he really does, I'm sure he has his reasons. Perhaps you remind him of a schoolyard enemy from his childhood. Maybe it's the sound of your voice. It's possible that there's just a certain je ne sais quois about your personality that rubs him the wrong way, and that even for all your best intentions, you cannot win him over. Quite possibly, he does not like the way that you criticize his handling of his job requirements.\n\n@jessespector Who do you think will be the next MLB star to retire in your opinion? #AskSpector -- Troy Johnson Jr. (@TroySports1)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI think it will be Derek Jeter, in about two weeks. Paul Konerko, too.\n\n@jessespector how much water should I drink right now to not be hung over tomorrow? -- Digger (@diggermotherx)\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\nI find that one glass of water for every two beers or equivalent thereof is a pretty solid rule of thumb. Once you cross a certain threshold of alcohol consumed, though, it's not going to matter.\n\n@jessespector My brother is a Cubs fan. Is there any chance he'll see them even contend (never mind win the WS) in his life? -- T. Rinn (@YawAxis)\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\nYes. Next year. So it is written in the scrolls of the North Side Church of McFly. So it will be done.\n\n#AskSpector In 2015 do the scrolls of #NorthSideChurchOfMcFly state that the majority of Cubs playoff and WS games are played during the day -- hedda spector (@heddaspector)\n\nSeptember 11, 2014\n\nAll we know from the scrolls is that the Cubs will win the 2015 World Series. It is likely that most of the games will be played at night, according to the Scrolls of Murdoch.\n\n@jessespector #AskSpector Why the farewell tour w/gifts from opposing teams for Jeter and Rivera? You don't see that in other sports. -- Chrissy Jung (@gonyr24)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI wish I knew. Certainly, some money going to the players' charities is a good thing, but it's all weird and a little uncomfortable. Respect is nice, sure, but a lot of this stuff feels forced.\n\n@jessespector #AskSpector If you got to change or implement one rule into MLB, what would it be? -- David Shemie (@dshemie8)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI might have a different answer if you asked me this tomorrow, but I would add a softball-style runner's base at first base. A runner is supposed to stay in foul territory while running to first base, but the base itself is inside the line. Allow the runner to make it there with a straight path, and increase safety for both runners and fielders -- the fact that a runner goes through first base, instead of stopping, as at other bases, makes collisions more dangerous, because the runner is not slowing down. Believe me, I know, because when I was in Little League, I tripped over the leg of a first baseman and broke my elbow.\n\n@jessespector Does Marty Brodeur play this season? If so where? #AskSpector -- Jason Waterfalls (@kranman85)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI think he would like to play, but it's hard to see where, especially given Brodeur's own perception of what kind of player he is at this point in contrast with the player he actually is.\n\n.@jessespector Who would you vote for in a presidential election: Bill Pullman or Harrison Ford? #AskSpector -- Daniel McFadin (@danielmcfadin)\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\nBill Pullman, for all the good he did against the aliens, still let his advisors talk him into nuking Houston. Vote for Harrison Ford, who also has the ability to protect himself in the CIA.\n\n@jessespector what beer do you recommend when you show up a day early for an event? Like say a baby shower. -- Monica McAlister (@MonicaMcAlister)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nI did show up a day early for a baby shower this weekend, and I did not drink beer. I had an egg cream. It was wonderful. Remember, if you're having an egg cream, make sure it's made with Fox's U-Bet syrup. Otherwise, you're doing it wrong.\n\n@jessespector #AskSpector how much should Dale Thayer charge for mustache rides? -- Zach Sanders (@zvsanders)\n\nSeptember 14, 2014\n\nTechnically, charging money for such a thing is against the law.

The Court Street IND station (not to be confused with the Court Street/Borough Hall BMT/IRT station a few blocks away) was built with the idea of connecting the Fulton Street line from Brooklyn to the Second Avenue line, which was never built, in Manhattan. When subway service finally does come to Second Avenue, it will not continue into Brooklyn. So, for a while, Court Street was a shuttle station connecting with Hoyt-Schermerhorn station, about a five-minute walk away. So, it was pretty useless, and they wound up turning it into a museum, as well as a place where subway-related movies (Taking of Pelham One-Two-Three!) have been shot. When you take the subway to the Transit Museum, you take the subway to either Hoyt-Schermerhorn or Court Street/Borough Hall, then get out of the subway, then walk to the corner of Schermerhorn Street and Boerum Place. Then you see the entrance to the museum and you know you have arrived.\n\n@jessespector where is my cell phone? -- Digger (@diggermotherx)\n\nSeptember 13, 2014\n\nWherever you last left it.

Disappointing, though, because there's still no rhombus in hockey.\n\nNew game misconduct penalties: OK, let's see the officials actually throw guys out of more games. Consider me dubious.\n\nSpin-O-Rama banned in shootouts: The worst thing the NHL has done from a rules standpoint since introducing the shootout in the first place.\n\nVideo review tweaks: Whatever. I got your \"distinct kicking motion\" right here.\n\nTripping rule revised: Fewer penalty shots? There should be more penalty shots. During games, though, not after.\n\nDiving fines: I like the idea, but doubt it will make a difference.\n\nPost-icing faceoffs: Finally addressed a glaring loophole. Good.\n\nSwitching ends of the ice for overtime: This makes sense. More of a chance for a goal with a sloppy line change or tired players unable to get to the bench.\n\nPuck over glass is still a two-minute minor instead of being treated like icing.

I think that, for any game, at any time in the season, you should be able to dress any 25 players from your 40-man roster. Keep it consistent all year long.

The thing about the playoff overtime goal is that it ends a game that otherwise might go on forever, just like the home run, but because it comes from fast-flowing play, it develops, and you can see it happening, or maybe it's just a crazy bounce, and it's just such a wild emotional release. The home run comes on a pitch -- and it can happen on any pitch -- but the feverish buildup is never there, because of baseball's pace. A regular-season hockey OT goal? Meh. They would've just gone to a shootout anyway.\n\nAn exception to the rule: August 8, 2000 -- A's at Yankees. Jason Isringharusen entered for Oakland with a 3-2 lead. First pitch: Bernie Williams home run to tie the game. Everyone in the Bronx goes crazy, and is still going crazy when Isiringhausen throws his next pitch: David Justice home run to end the game. There was literally dancing in the streets after that. That's about the only way that you can get action that fast to swing a game in baseball. That might be my favorite game that I've ever attended, and I'm pretty sure that it was a free ticket as a bonus for having stayed through a three-hour rain delay earlier in the year.

It's important to make that distinction, because you asked about a small bushel, and I am stalling for time. I do not have an answer, because I do not have the full details of what kind of crabs we are dealing with here. You could fit way more hermit crabs in a bushel than soft-shell crabs, for instance, but that number would be dwarfed by the number of crabs that you could fit in a bushel if you were dealing with pubic lice. Did you know that pubic lice can live in your eyelashes because of the similarity of the hair? I found this out because when you Google the word \"crabs,\" what comes up is a picture of a human eye with pubic lice on it.

But this acquisition will help Microsoft expand its gaming division, which also includes game franchises such as the Halo shooter game and Forza racing game.", "Apple wants the plastic credit card to become as rare as the paper check.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced Apple Pay, a digital payment system that lets people pay for retail store purchases using their phones rather than cash or credit cards. The service, which will work both with iPhones and Apple's new Watch, is backed by a host of big retailers, along with most major banks and credit card issuers, including Visa, MasterCard and American Express.\n\nSo-called contactless payment isn't new. Starbucks, McDonald's, PayPal, Google and Square offer their own services, but only a small portion of customers use them. Some experts believe Apple Pay -- with its presence on millions of iPhones and its advanced security features -- could be the service that leads to widespread adoption of the digital wallet.\n\nCiti Investment Research analyst Mark May believes the sum total of mobile payments could grow from $1 billion in 2013 to $58.4 billion by 2017.\n\nPayment digitization paints an enticing vision of shopping's future: simply tap your device against a checkout screen and walk away with your new shoes.\n\nBut despite the flashy Apple Pay launch, Apple faces challenges making that vision a reality. The company and other digital wallet providers must convince shoppers that the transactions are safe -- especially in the wake of recent high-profile data breaches at Home Depot and Target. Meanwhile, the company must also make a case to retailers that it's worth it for them to invest in new point-of-sale systems.\n\nMany U.S. merchants still aren't sold on the idea. About 220,000 stores are set up to accept Apple Pay. That's only 5.5 percent of the 3.6 million retail locations in the U.S., according to the National Retail Federation. The biggest U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are not participating in Apple Pay.\n\nThe main reason is cost. Each point-of-sale device, which uses something called near-field communication technology, costs hundreds of dollars, plus hours of worker training. And there's been little customer demand for the systems.\n\nThat may change now that Apple has entered the arena, says Gartner analyst Avivah Litan.\n\n\"There's no doubt young people want to use phones to make payments, but they have to have a place to pay,\" says Litan. She predicts bigger retailers will see how well Apple partners like McDonald's do before they move into mobile payments.\n\n\"If it goes well at other retailers, Wal-Mart and other companies may break down and start taking it,\" Litan says.\n\nIn countries such as Canada and the U.K., contactless point-of-sale systems are widespread, and as a result, such payments are far more common. In Canada, for instance, about 20 percent of transactions at registers processed by MasterCard are completed by contactless payment, according to MasterCard.\n\n\"What you learn from that is when consumers start 'tapping' two or three times, they never go back to their old behavior at that merchant. ... It's just a much better experience,\" says Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard.\n\nOne of the strengths of Apple Pay is its security. Its system uses the company's Touch ID fingerprint technology, a secure chip, and payments that require a one-time security code.\n\nThat kind of security -- similar to the chip-and-pin credit card system used in Europe -- would prevent the type of breaches that happened at Target and Home Depot. And it could be a compelling reason for retailers to adopt Apple Pay, Litan says.\n\n\"If you get enough people using the service, it would cut down on retailers' security costs, and that's why over time it may really take off,\" she says.\n\nStill, not everyone is convinced that swiping a credit or debit card is that much of an inconvenience in the first place. Bill Ready, head of next generation commerce at PayPal, points out that near-field communication has been around for 10 years without catching on. His vision of the mobile payment future is more akin to an \"e-commerce style transaction happening in the physical world,\" he says, citing the example of car-sharing service Uber, which works with PayPal to processes riders' payments by way of a mobile phone app.\n\n\"Uber addressed a real pain point, in that hailing a taxi and payment for a taxi is cumbersome,\" he says. \"We're focused on those types of things more than killing the card swipe.\"\n\nEven amid the differing visions, most experts agree that the march toward the digitization of payment will continue.\n\n\"Someone is going to figure out how to make mobile payments easy and cheap and then we're talking a real shift in consumer behavior,\" says Gartner's Litan.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

In 2018, IDC forecasts feature phones will make up less than 5% of the market.\n\nThe figures put Brazil in the forefront of Latin America, according to the consultancy. Since 3Q13 the share of smartphones to total handsets sold in Brazil has been larger than both the LatAm and global averages, IDC said.\n\nAmong the chief drivers of the surge in smartphone sales are the expansion in the number of products available, aligned with a decline in prices; greater investment from channels, mostly retailers; and tax breaks granted by the government for locally manufactured smartphones.\n\nANDROID DOMINANCE\n\nThe report also highlights the overwhelming dominance of devices running on Android platforms, with over 90% of handsets sold in the quarter embedding Google's operating system.\n\nThe average price of cell phones sold in the period was 700 reais (US$318).", "Self-driving cars are bearing down on California's future, and state Department of Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones wants insurers and regulators to prepare now for their eventual arrival.\n\nTo that end, Jones hosted a public hearing at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose Monday morning to gather data about what automated vehicle technology will look like. To prepare for the event he even took a 25-minute spin in one of Google's test cars on the streets of Mountain View.\n\n\"And I have to say it was with a little trepidation that I first sat down in the car, but after a few minutes I was quite comfortable to see that steering wheel moving by itself,\" said Jones, adding that the car performed \"flawlessly\" around pedestrians and other cars.\n\nAfter the hearing, Jones said that one of the most pressing insurance questions is who would be liable when an automatic system is in control. Other regulatory issues include the handling of data collected for insurance by automated vehicle systems, he said. The state Department of Motor Vehicles is separately developing regulations for the actual operation of automated vehicles.\n\nA variety of legal and insurance experts testified, as well as a consumer rights advocate.\n\nAlain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering, was enthusiastic about the potential for automated driving technologies to improve safety, unburden drivers and lower insurance costs.\n\nVarying levels of the technology will be applied in different settings, he said.\n\nCommercial fleets, for example, could be more amenable for fully automated uses, while average drivers might use some sort of hybrid, that allows drivers to assume control when needed, he said.\n\nPatrick Hoge covers technology for the San Francisco Business Times.", "Shubham Shah discovered a security flaw in the way Vodafone handled voicemail. Photo: Peter Rae\n\nAn 18-year-old security researcher from Sydney who found a flaw in Optus' mobile voicemail service has found another vulnerability, this time in Vodafone Australia's voicemail system.\n\nThe flaw was only resolved after Fairfax Media raised a series of questions about the vulnerability, which also exposed Vodafone customers to identity theft through unauthorised access to online services such as Google, which use two-factor authentication via a phone call.\n\nThe Vodafone flaw allowed anyone to \"bruteforce\" a target's voicemail PIN using easily accessible technology and gain access to the phone subscriber's voicemail messages.\n\nHuey Peard, 17, helped identify the flaw.\n\nThe practice of brute forcing involves hackers using software to try multiple PIN combinations to gain access to a service. Typically secure systems employ bruteforce protection that will lock hackers out after a certain number of incorrect attempts, but Vodafone's Australian system had no such protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flaw also allowed outsiders to retrieve Vodafone customers' two-factor authentication codes, or tokens, used to access their Google, Yahoo and other online accounts.\n\nThese codes - which come in handy as a second layer of security when online log-in credentials are stolen - are usually sent via text message but can also be sent via a phone call and end up in voicemail.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest hackers made use of the flaw on any of Vodafone's 4.9 million customer accounts. It was corrected in June but Fairfax waited until global carriers could secure their infrastructure before revealing it.\n\nThe researcher, Shubham Shah, is due to present his findings at the Ruxcon security conference in Melbourne next month alongside his friend and high school student Huey Peard, 17, one of the founding members of Gibson Security. Last year the group published exploits found in disappearing photo-sharing app Snapchat. The revelations allowed another group to release usernames and mobile numbers of 4.5 million Snapchat users online.\n\n\"We were made aware of research that identified a security issue with our visual voicemail service,\" Eyman Ahmed, head of information security at Vodafone, said in a statement. \"Vodafone's technical team responded to the matter within a matter of hours, and has updated its systems to address it. We thank the researcher for responsibly disclosing this issue to us so that we could address it and ensure our customers remain protected.\"\n\nBut Mr Shah said the fix Vodafone implemented was not well thought out. It involved, he said, locking out hackers - as well as users - from their voicemail after five incorrect PIN attempts. This meant anyone could lock a user out, requiring them to call support to reset their voicemail and start from scratch (meaning old voicemails are also deleted).\n\nThe vulnerability was linked to the carrier's visual voicemail offered to customers using Apple's iPhone. It's understood the four other global markets where Vodafone offers visual voicemail were not affected.\n\nTo notify others telcos about the flaw, Mr Shah informed the GSM Association (GSMA), a group whose members include global telecommunications companies.\n\nJames Moran of the GSMA said the group was \"very grateful\" for Mr Shah's co-operation and confirmed that operators were sent a security alert last week.\n\nAs the flaw potentially affects certain configurations of the visual voicemail system, Mr Shah also notified Apple, who acknowledged his findings.\n\n\"Thank you for contacting Apple Product Security,\" a company representative told him. \"We appreciate you keeping us informed of your research, and hope your presentation goes well.\"", "Thanks to James for sending us some packets.

Connecticut has no such system, and state and local officials warned the lack of such service is putting this state in the slow lane of the information highway.\n\nKatz warned that it will be at least three-to-five years before any Connecticut city could see this sort of ultra-fast Internet service. \"We're talking about major infrastructure,\" she said. \"It's not going to happen overnight.\"\n\nGoogle staged a competition several years ago to choose the first city to receive it's ultra-high speed Internet service and Kansas City won in 2011. Katz said Google Fiber's service in that city \"is just starting to roll out now.\"\n\nCharles Ward, a chief information officer and technology analyst for a private investment firm in West Hartford who appeared during the news conference Monday, said Google's customers in Kansas City are now paying $70 a month for the gigabit service, and that real estate prices \"have sky rocketed\" because of all the young people moving in to work at high-tech start-ups.\n\nWard said his company's Internet service in West Hartford is, by contrast, \"costly and slow.\"\n\n\"We have to move forward,\" said New Haven Mayor Toni Harp. She said the slow Internet service for many Connecticut consumers is now rated at 9 megabits per second, and is holding up economic progress. Ultra-high speed service at up to 1,000 megabits per second, would allow information to \"glide almost effortlessly around Connecticut and beyond, \" Harp said.\n\nNaiara Azpiri, vice president of a high-tech New Haven-based start-up named Veoci, also a participant in the news conference, called the project to get faster Internet service in Connecticut \"extremely important to us\" because her company serves a global customer base. Veoci is a web-based emergency management software company.\n\nHarp, West Hartford Deputy Mayor Shari Cantor, and Stamford Mayor David R. Martin said they are also hoping other Connecticut municipalities will join what they envision as a \"gigabite capable network in targeted commercial corridors.\"\n\nKatz said that major Internet service providers are already offering this type of service in virtually every region of the nation except Connecticut and most of New England.\n\nThe only areas in New England that do have gigabit Internet service is one section of Maine linked to the University of Maine's system, and Burlington, Vermont.\n\nTwo years ago, Sen. Beth Bye, D-West Hartford, managed to get a bill through the General Assembly that allowed existing utility poles to be used to create high-speed Internet systems. But no Internet provider has yet taken advantage of that legislation.\n\n\"I don't think we're behind the curve,\" Katz said of the lack of progress in Connecticut toward gigabit-speed service. \"The whole [New England] region has had challenges for reasons I don't completely understand,\" she added.\n\nAccording to Katz, the requests put out by the three cities this week \"doesn't involve municipal financial support\" for creating any of these new systems.\n\nCompanies interested in talking with the cities about high-speed networks should respond with any questions by Oct. 15, and full responses must be back by Nov. 18, Katz said.", "The story of Cilla Black aired on ITV tonight in a brand new three-part drama.\n\nSheridan Smith plays the role of the Scottie Road singer, charting her rise to fame in 1960s Liverpool.\n\nWe brought you all the build-up, as well as live updates as the first episode went out on Monday night.\n\n5:04 pm Kirsty McHale\n\nHello, and welcome to our live blog ahead of the premiere of Cilla.\n\nThe three-part drama stars Sheridan Smith as the Scottie Road singer, and charts her rise to fame in 1960s Liverpool.\n\nThe show airs on ITV1 tonight at 9pm, and we'll be here to bring you all the build-up and preview coverage ahead of the first episode.\n\n5:19 pm Kirsty McHale\n\nThe ITV drama is set in 1960s Liverpool, which meant the production team had to recreate some of the city's famous from that era.\n\nJade Wright spoke to some of the stars and producers of the show on the challenges of recreating 1960s Liverpool.\n\n5:31 pm Kirsty McHale\n\nJohn Henshaw, who play's Cilla's father John White in the show, has shared this snap of the White family ahead of tonight's first episode.\n\nHere I am as John White with @melaniejhil as Big Cilla and @Sheridansmith1 as Cilla! @ITV pic.twitter.com/I1NSYEqmfL -- John Henshaw (@JohnHenshawUK)\n\nSeptember 15, 2014\n\n5:51 pm Kirsty McHale\n\nJohn Henshaw says he joined Twitter today specifically to check out the reaction to Cilla, and at least one of his co-stars is thrilled...\n\n\"@JohnHenshawUK: I've joined Twitter today to see all reactions to #Cilla with @Sheridansmith1\" Wahey!!!

Corporate tax rates are not an issue.\n\nThe proposals, which involve 140 countries, cover seven of 15 aspects of profit shifting and base erosion as requested by the G20.\n\nThey include digital economy; hybrid mismatches; harmful tax practices; treaty abuse; transfer pricing documentation and intangibles; and multilateral instruments.\n\nPlans for the remaining aspects will be delivered next September and only then will the details of the whole package be finalised. The second part, which will determine how the rules are implemented, are considered to be potentially more important that the rules themselves.\n\n\"Tax evasion has been depriving governments of precious resources for decades, said OECD secretary general Angel Gurria, unveiling the package in Paris.\n\n\"Governments looking to jumpstart growth and exit the crisis and create jobs while base erosion and profit shifting was going on that weakened the process. This is the beginning of the end of those corrosive practices.\"\n\nHe added that the actions \"will revolutionise the world of international taxation as we know it today\".\n\nTransfer pricing is a major target where companies create so-called cash or letterbox companies that do not in themselves produce goods or profit, but can lend to the parent company reducing their tax liability where the value is actually being created.\n\nCurrently, companies are holding more than $2 trillion in offshore accounts, out of reach for any taxman.\n\nTo eliminate transfer pricing of intangibles -- such as internet-based products, patents, and royalties -- profits will be allocated on the basis of what companies are doing in terms of value-added activities, bearing risks, and providing assets, taking into account legal ownership.\n\nWhile there is agreement on the need to tackle the cash/letterbox issue, how this will be done has still be to decided. But the measures will have to ensure the pricing is correct.\n\nCountry by country reporting will provide the data to know where exactly multinationals stand on their tax obligations. They will have to report to each country where they are generating profits, revenue, tax paid, employees, and intangibles.\n\n\"If you have two employees and \u20ac500m in profits and no tax paid, you know to look at the transfer pricing issue,\" said an OECD expert, adding that it still had to decide what size of companies would need to file reports.\n\nIt is planning to produce a standard form but the information will be confidential to the taxation authorities -- something for which many countries and businesses were pushing.\n\n\"This will give a broad picture of where sales and profits are generated, where taxes are paid, employees are located, and assets deployed, so every country will have an overall picture,\" Mr Gurria added.\n\n\"It will be confidential information but a game changer.\"\n\nHybrid mismatches are when companies take advantage of different treaties that would be eliminated or neutralised. For instance, 27% of direct investment in India is routed through Mauritius, leaving India at a loss.\n\nMr Gurria said countries were committed to minimum standards to prevent treaty shopping.\n\nThere are also plans to replace the more than 3,000 tax agreements in existence with a single tax agreement model devised by the OECD in a move to reduce 'treaty shopping' and allowing companies play one country against another.\n\nCountries have agreed that the digital businesses will be taxed the same as any other business -- something that Ireland and the US were both pressing for. This approach is also consistent with the recent report from the EU.\n\nHowever, there are many in the US that do not favour the moves and some experts in the area believe that despite US President Barack Obama being supportive, it will never get through Congress.\n\nIn the meantime, the first half of the package will go to the G20 finance ministers meeting in Australia at the weekend and then the G20 leaders in November.\n\nAn international conference is planned for January to draft an instrument that will cover countries responsible for 90% of the global economy.", "The Centre on Tuesday informed the Delhi High Court that it has advised all social networking sites including Google and Facebook to display on their websites the name and contact details of the grievance officer to deal with complaints from any user or victim.\n\n\"I say that in compliance of the order, Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology had advised all industry associations to comply with the direction of this court,\" a central government official told a bench headed by Justice B D Ahmed.\n\nGulshan Rai, working as a Group Coordinator and Director General in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, filed an affidavit in theis regard on behalf of the Centre, after the court on August 23 last year had directed websites to display the name and contact details of grievance officers to deal with complaints, observing that \"the social networking sites such as Facebook and Orkut cannot flout the law just because they are a foreign company\".\n\n(Also See: Facebook Seeking India Revenue Boost With 'Missed Call' Ads)\n\nHe stated that the industry associations (of the sites) have also confirmed that they have advised their members to appoint and publish name of the grievance officers on their respective websites.\n\n\"The deponent has checked up and found that large number of intermediaries have complied with the orders of this court,\" the affidavit has stated.\n\nRai said that the Centre has also \"received various letters sent by the industry association and individual intermediaries\". The court has also sought the Centre's stand on the petitioner's allegation that Delhi Police, Indian Railways and others have created accounts on social networking sites despite government departments being barred from doing so under the law.", "According to a Financial Times report, Apple is set to receive a 0.15% cut from each transaction executed on its new Apple Pay system. This equates to 15 cents in every $100 purchase.\n\nThe report states [] that this is an \"unprecedented deal, giving Apple a share of the payments' economics that rivals such as Google do not get for their services.\"\n\nThe report said that Apple was able to negotiate with so many major banks, including Chase Bank, Bank of America (BAC), Citibank and payment networks and receive choice deals because the industry - for now, at least - doesn't see Cupertino's pay model as disruptive to their business. In fact, an unnamed bank executive was quoted as saying in the FT report that Apple's payment model continued to put banks \"at the centre of payments.\"\n\nIf Apple's new one-touch mobile payment system, which stores you payment info in an encrypted and secure fashion, catches on, this could be a big deal for the company considering the U.S. alone sees $12 billion worth of transactions per day.

This is the problem we are addressing,\" Made With Code spokesperson Kate Parker told Efe news agency.\n\nThe initiative was launched in mid-June and, over the next three years, Google will set aside $50 million for the programme.\n\nThe project began against the backdrop of an ongoing debate about the lack of gender as well as racial diversity in the Silicon Valley.\n\nFor example, only 30 percent of Google's employees are women. A similar gender disparity, if not worse, exists in other companies like Twitter, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.\n\nTo resolve the problem, Google seeks to go to the root: the lack of interest among girls in programming and computer science, as only 18 percent of all students majoring in the subject in the US are women.\n\nThis figure is well below the 37 percent recorded during the 1980s, and the trend contributes to the existing male dominance in Silicon Valley.\n\nAccording to Google, this lack of interest among girls is due to them not relating programming with the fields of their interest, not realising that other girls do it too or not knowing that they can do well in this field.\n\n\"We look to change the perception about programming. We hope that once the girls see all the incredible things computers can do, they develop an interest in the subject,\" Parker said.\n\nMade With Code will organise events where girls will be invited to do programming together and discover that computer programme codes can be used to make and print bracelets using 3D printers, design accessories to superimpose on \"selfies\" or compose an instrumental piece.\n\n(Also See: Google Unveils First Set of Android Apps for Chrome OS)\n\nThe initiative will also have a strong virtual presence which Google considers as extremely important for a wider reach.\n\nThe website of Made With Code draws the attention of girls to the fact that many of the things they like are made using codes, and even includes simple classes to enable them to take their first steps in programming.\n\nThe website, which has pink overtones, also includes several videos where young people like Miral Kotb explain how coding and dance go hand-in-hand in Broadway musicals.\n\nIn other videos, girls successful in their fields narrate how computer technology can help to combat diseases and crime, design video games and create special-effects in movies made at Pixar studios.\n\n\"The message we are trying to convey is that programming and computer technology is a naturally creative field and serves as a gateway to many industries and other diverse fields,\" Parker emphasised.\n\n\"We want the girls to understand that basic knowledge of computers is necessary for anything they want to do when they grow up,\" she added.\n\nSusan Wojcicki, a Youtube representative, said during the launch of Made With Code that programming is \"a new form of alphabetisation and offers the possibility to create, innovate and, literally, change the world\".\n\nGoogle will seek the support of parents and teacher, which it considers crucial for the girls to progress in this field.\n\nThe company is also associated with organisations like the Girl Scouts of the USA, National Centre for Women and Information Technology, Teach for America and Unicef, among others, in order to present the initiative to young people in their networks.\n\nThe US Department of Labour estimates that by 2020 there will be over 1.4 million job vacancies in the field of computer science, but going by the present rate, only 30 percent of these posts will be filled by graduates from the US who are competent in the field.", "The Android Wear bug reportedly closes the full screen app and shows the pedometer card on the main home screen of the smartwatch, resulting in users to restart the app repeatedly.\n\nA new Android Wear bug has been reported that leads to an unexpected shutdown of full-screen apps using the smartwatch's accelerometer.\n\nAs per the user who posted the bug, only those apps using the accelerometer are affected that run as a full screen activity. The app crash is said to arise due to a conflict for accelerometer data, as Android Wear smartwatches natively use accumulated data from the accelerometer to update the pedometer count.\n\nThe Android Wear bug reportedly forces a full-screen app using the accelerometer to shutdown, and the user is shown a pedometer card on the home screen of the smartwatch instead.\n\n\"I have an interactive Android Wear activity running in full screen mode. It uses the accelerometer for input. While interacting with the device, the app will be randomly stopped and thrown back to the clock homescreen to show a new card, mostly the pedometer step counter increasing due to my chosen input method. This leads to frustrating user experience, as the app needs to be constantly restarted,\" stated the user on the Android Open Source Project page.\n\nNotably, the user who faced the issue also detailed a workaround method for app developers to avoid this unexpected closing of apps. The developers instead of starting such apps on full screen, can create a \"persistent notification in the context stream\" preventing other cards to stop the app's activity.\n\n\"Instead of starting your app as a full screen activity, try creating a persistent notification in the context stream, then, give that notification an action to go full screen. This should prevent other cards from stopping your activity, so you can continue to collect accelerometer data and display it to your users,\" stated the user as per Android Authority.\n\nGoogle is yet to comment on the issue or roll out an update to eliminate the bug.\n\nOn a related note, a designer named UhrArt cloned the Apple Watch's watch face for Android Wear-powered smartwatches on Monday.

Image: Jay Paul Company\n\nOffice development is booming in Santa Clara County. As the number of jobs increases, will the Valley Transportation Authority ramp up bus service to keep pace, or will streets become overrun with traffic?\n\nVTA hosted a public meeting last week to present a set of proposed changes to its bus service that the agency calls its North Central County Bus Improvement Plan, designed to adapt to commuting patterns created by the recent growth of large office parks in areas that lack transit. About 70 people, mostly seniors and residents of Sunnyvale, attended the meeting at Sunnyvale's City Hall.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of changes in land use in these four cities,\" said VTA Transportation Planner Adam Burger, who pointed to major office developments that are expected to bring several thousand more commuters through the region in coming years. Campuses are growing for Google and Intuit in Mountain View, Apple in Cupertino, Moffett Towers and LinkedIn in Sunnyvale, and the Levi's Stadium area in Santa Clara.\n\n\"All these land use changes create new travel demand,\" said Burger. \"So we have to adapt our bus system to match the new travel patterns that people use.\" VTA aims to provide major office developments with better transit and connect them to the bus rapid transit routes coming to El Camino Real in 2018 and Stevens Creek Boulevard in 2019.\n\nBut VTA only proposes improvements on a single north-south route that would help a significant number of passengers transfer to and from buses on the BRT routes. A new Bus 354 would supplement the existing Bus 54 with limited-stop service along a similar route on Mathilda and Hollenbeck Avenues between the Lockheed Martin Transit Center in Moffett Park and De Anza Community College in Cupertino. Despite large and growing concentrations of jobs in Moffett Park, along Mathilda Avenue, and in downtown Sunnyvale, Bus 54 still only runs every 30 minutes on weekdays and every 45 minutes on weekends.\n\nResidents expressed frustration at Tuesday's meeting that thousands of car commuters are now clogging local streets and highways in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara on their way to jobs in massive new corporate campuses, while few improvements are being made to the region's bus system.\n\n\"Office development is creating more north-south commutes,\" said Sunnyvale resident Holly Lofgren. \"We need a practical commute solution for it.\"\n\nThe VTA needs to act more urgently to improve transit service, former Sunnyvale mayor Tony Spitaleri told the crowd at a TransForm panel discussion on the future of transit on El Camino Real Thursday evening. \"Until we come up with a grid system that works to carry a lot more people north-south from Moffett Park all the way to De Anza, the Bus Rapid Transit project on El Camino will only serve to obstruct traffic,\" Spitaleri said. \"We continue to hear [from VTA], 'We're studying it'.\"\n\nMathilda/Hollenbeck was one of six potential bus rapid transit lines analyzed in VTA's 2009 Bus Rapid Transit Strategic Plan, but on that route VTA isn't moving forward with BRT-type improvements, such as frequent, all-day service with limited stops, bus signal priority, and dedicated bus lanes. Only the Alum Rock, El Camino Real, and Stevens Creek BRT projects have been chosen for implementation by 2019.\n\n\"Current transit demand is low, with few boardings in the middle of the corridor,\" the Mathilda/Hollenbeck corridor study states. \"Land use, congestion, and demand conditions warrant lower cost improvements to local service and bus stops.\"\n\n\"Just run the 54 bus every 15 or 20 minutes,\" bus rider Michael Ludwig told planners at Tuesday's meeting.\n\nVTA buses 54 and 55, which run north-south from De Anza Community College through downtown Sunnyvale to Moffett Park and northwest Santa Clara, respectively, averaged about 4,000 trips per weekday as of April 2013, despite running only every 30 minutes. In comparison, VTA's bus routes 23 and 323, which provide at least 15-minute frequency along Stevens Creek Boulevard, together carry just over 10,000 passengers, and many of these trips are on Bus 23's eastern segment between downtown San Jose and Alum Rock in east San Jose.\n\n\"The demand for better north-south transit is there, even though the frequency is 30 minutes,\" said Sunnyvale City Council Member David Whittum. \"Since that strategic study in 2009, which was based on economic data from 2008, with empty offices and high unemployment, we've had quite a lot of development.\"\n\nVTA also presented two \"study concepts\" for the northern and southern ends of the Mathilda/Hollenbeck corridor: a bus station at De Anza Community College and a \"circulator shuttle\" to the new Moffett Towers development on the western edge of Moffett Park.\n\nIn Mountain View, VTA proposes extending Bus 40 about one mile along Shoreline Boulevard to the Mountain View Caltrain Station from the route's current terminus on Shoreline Boulevard just north of Highway 101. Currently, no VTA bus connects downtown Mountain View with the city's North Bayshore office park, which can expand by up to 3.4 million square feet under the city's 2012 General Plan, bringing over 10,000 new workers to the area by 2030.\n\nOddly, Bus 328 was another north-south route proposed for improved service, despite minuscule ridership -- just 70 trips on an average weekday. The route has the second-lowest \"productivity,\" defined as boardings per hour per bus, out of 23 VTA bus routes serving northern Santa Clara County, according to a report by transportation consulting firm Nelson\\Nygaard. A third daily round-trip bus would be added to the existing two buses that carry peak-hour commuters from the extreme southern edge of San Jose's urbanized area, at the Almaden Expressway and Via Valiente, to Moffett Park.\n\nVTA also proposed three east-west bus route changes to address growing travel to new office developments in Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and Cupertino. A minor realignment of 1.5 miles of Bus 32's route from Central Expressway to Maude Avenue would serve commuters heading to well over one million square feet of new offices in Sunnyvale's Peery Park. A new east-west route running from the Sunnyvale Caltrain Station to north First Street in San Jose via Arques Avenue and Scott Boulevard would be added to \"introduce all-day service to this rapidly-growing office corridor.\" And Bus 53's current southern end in Saratoga would be re-routed east on Homestead Road, to \"reintroduce service to the Homestead corridor between Hollenbeck and Wolfe and improve connections between the Apple Campus 2 and future Stevens Creek Bus Rapid Transit.\" Finally, Bus 54 would extended south from De Anza Community College to replace the service to Saratoga currently provided by Bus 53.\n\nTwo other service changes VTA is considering are the direct result of Santa Clara's enormous City Place proposal, with offices, retail, restaurants, a hotel, and 380 housing units on the site of a city-owned golf course and BMX track. Because this \"mixed-use\" development would consist mostly of office space, it would hugely increase travel to the area near Levi's Stadium.\n\nNorth-south bus service would be established on Lafayette Street, \"contingent on future development in the Lafayette corridor, including the City Place Santa Clara project.\" VTA is also considering \"relocating the VTA hub in northern Santa Clara from the Old Ironsides Light Rail Station farther east, closer to Levi's Stadium and City Place.\" This new transit hub would likely result in the re-routing of several VTA buses that currently serve Great American Parkway and Tasman Drive.\n\nVTA says it plans to consider public input, analyze the potential ridership on the new and modified bus routes, and develop a detailed bus service improvement plan to be presented at additional public meetings in early 2015. If approved by the VTA Board in May, the service changes would be implemented in July 2015.", "By Richa Maheshwari & Varun Sood\n\nBANGALORE: Information technology firm Mindtree says its sees \"tremendous\" opportunity for its second incubation idea in digital surveillance space as it can put an end to the conventional style of monitoring CCTV feeds for long hours.\n\nThe Bangalore-based company plans to spin off the idea that offers proactive rather than reactive surveillance into an independent firm over the next six months, top executives said. The company has invested about $1.5 million (about Rs 9 crore) in incubating the idea. \"We started working on the idea in around May-June 2011,\" said Sharmila Saha, vice-president and head of digital surveillance products at Mindtree. \"The Mumbai attacks (of November 26, 2008) gave us the impetus that something needs to be done. Late 2012 is when we started approaching the market with our solutions.\"\n\nMindtree had earlier successfully spun off Nuvepro into a cloud computing company. Digital surveillance has brought revenues of about $900,000 to Mindtree, according to company executives.\n\nSaha and her team of four executives worked on the second incubation idea for over six months before pitching it to the management in early 2012. The team submitted the idea under the company's \"5 by 50\" programme, an entrepreneurial initiative under which Mindtree selects five ideas given by its employees that have the potential generate $50 million in revenue in five years. A month after submitting the idea, Saha's team got a boost after Council of Scientific and Industrial Research funded the project with a loan of Rs 4 crore.\n\n\"So, unlike the previous one (cloud-based Nuvepro), which was an internal validation, here the idea is good and a government body like CSIR have chosen this one and are willing to invest in it,\" said S Janakiraman, cofounder of Mindtree and Nuvepro.\n\n\"That itself is a validation.\" Sharad Sharma, co-founder of think-tank and start-up consultancy iSPIRT, said, \"This is a good idea. But the challenge remains ahead of any start up on the management front. You don't want to bring in that ossification because of the incumbent management. So, you want to get the right set of executives to scale up the start-up\". Janakiraman said that for this reason, the management at Mindtree is considering the best option before it is also set up as an independent firm.\n\nBoth Saha and Janakiraman are betting on this latest project as the country does not have any player operating in this \"niche space\" and even globally, there is huge demand for such services. Earlier this year, Google paid over a $1 billion to buy out DropCam, a USbased video monitoring and cloud recording company.\n\nOver the last three-and-a-half years, Saha's team has come up with hi-tech solutions including Gladius, which is a video management software solution, and SecureMind, a surveillance manager solution, which helps to remotely manage the installations through a web browser.\n\nThis digital surveillance idea has until now found 50 clients, including public sector enterprises, Karnataka chief minister's residence and Karnataka High Court. Janakiraman said they generate 60% of revenues from overseas clients. Mindtree also believes the idea could find interest from schools and automated teller machines, both of which have seen security violations in the past.\n\nIn India, companies like Zicom offer security solutions but Mindtree believes their product has an edge over competition as it offers audio-video analytics and real-time updates.", "NEW DELHI: Smartphone chipmaker MediaTek will leverage its Android One partnership with Google and use India as a springboard to scale up its presence in the developed markets of US and Europe, where rival Qualcomm has a dominant position.\n\nAs part of a broader plan with Google, an array of smartphones, including those supporting LTE, a standard for highspeed mobile data, will be launched in India as the associated network develops towards the beginning of next year, Mohit Bhushan, vice president and general manager, US corporate marketing for MediaTek, told ET.\n\n\"We're striving to get into the West and get a piece of that action by showing our growth as a premium (chipset) supplier,\" Bhushan said. MediaTek is the first chipset supplier that Google tied up with for smartphones on the Android One platform, launched on Monday.\n\nMicromax, Karbonn and Spice each introduced a smartphone with a 4.5-inch screen, dual-sim, 5-mega pixel camera and 1 GB RAM, priced at Rs 6,499, Rs 6,399 and Rs 6,299, respectively, using MediaTek's quad-core processor. The leading chip supplier for Chinese smartphones, MediaTek aims to penetrate carrierled Western markets and at the same time move ahead of the competition in India, Indonesia and the Philippines with Android One, Google's major initiative to offer rich smartphone experience on low-cost devices with set hardware and software standards across handset makers.\n\nAmerican and European carriers subsidise smartphones significantly for customers who sign up for one to two year calling and data plans or contracts. Bhushan said the carriers would be able to cut out the cost of the devices completely by adding Android One devices to their portfolio.\n\nAccording to Strategy Analytics' data in the first quarter this year, Qualcomm leads with 66% share of the world's wireless chipset market by revenue, followed by MediaTek with 15% and Spreadtrum Communications with 5%. Google announced Qualcomm as its second chipset partner at the launch on Monday.\n\nTaiwan-based MediaTek, which is involved in business development with Google, said it shared insights about the Indian smartphone market with the Internet giant for enabling the Android One launch and introduced Google executives to the \"right people\" in Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, owing to its long-term relationships with the domestic handset vendors.\n\nThe company expects prices of 3G devices to fall below $100 (Rs 6,000) as sales of Android One smartphones pick up around Diwali. Micromax, Karbonn and Spice expect to sell lakhs of Android One devices over the next month and sales may collectively be about 1.5 to 2 million by the end of the year.", "Bug enables malicious sites to grab cookies, passwords from other sites.\n\nA bug quietly reported on September 1 appears to have grave implications for Android users. Android Browser, the open source, WebKit-based browser that used to be part of the Android Open Source Platform (AOSP), has a flaw that enables malicious sites to inject JavaScript into other sites. Those malicious JavaScripts can in turn read cookies and password fields, submit forms, grab keyboard input, or do practically anything else.\n\nBrowsers are generally designed to prevent a script from one site from being able to access content from another site. They do this by enforcing what is called the Same Origin Policy (SOP): scripts can only read or modify resources (such as the elements of a webpage) that come from the same origin as the script, where the origin is determined by the combination of scheme (which is to say, protocol, typically HTTP or HTTPS), domain, and port number.\n\nThe SOP should then prevent a script loaded from http://malware.bad/ from being able to access content at https://paypal.com/.\n\nThe Android Browser bug breaks the browser's handling of the SOP. As Rafay Baloch, the researcher who discovered the problem found, JavaScript constructed in a particular way could ignore the SOP and freely meddle with other sites' content without restriction.\n\nThis means that potentially any site visited in the browser could be stealing sensitive data. It's a bug that needs fixing, and fast.\n\nAs part of its attempts to gain more control over Android, Google has discontinued the AOSP Browser. Android Browser used to be the default browser on Google, but this changed in Android 4.2, when Google switched to Chrome. The core parts of Android Browser were still used to power embedded Web view controls within applications, but even this changed in Android 4.4, when it switched to a Chromium-based browser engine.\n\nBut just as Microsoft's end-of-life for Windows XP didn't make that operating system magically disappear from the Web, Google's discontinuation of the open source Browser app hasn't made it disappear from the Web either. As our monthly look at Web browser usage shows, Android Browser has a little more real-world usage than Chrome for Android, with something like 40-50 percent of Android users using the flawed browser.\n\nThe Android Browser is likely to be embedded in third-party products, too, and some Android users have even installed it on their Android 4.4 phones because for one reason or another they prefer it to Chrome.\n\nGoogle's own numbers paint an even worse picture. According to the online advertising giant, only 24.5 percent of Android users are using version 4.4. The majority of Android users are using versions that include the broken component, and many of these users are using 4.1.x or below, so they're not even using versions of Android that use Chrome as the default browser.\n\nBaloch initially reported the bug to Google, but the company told him that it couldn't reproduce the problem and closed his report. Since he wrote his blog post, a Metasploit module has been developed to enable the popular security testing framework to detect the problem, and Metasploit developers have branded the problem a \"privacy disaster.\" Baloch says that Google has subsequently changed its response, agreeing that it can reproduce the problem and saying that it is working on a suitable fix.\n\nJust how this fix will be made useful is unclear. While Chrome is updated through the Play Store, the AOSP Browser is generally updated only through operating system updates. Timely availability of Android updates remains a sticking point for the operating system, so even if Google develops a fix, it may well be unavailable to those who actually need it.\n\nUsers of Android 4.0 and up can avoid much of the exposure by switching to Chrome, Firefox, or Opera, none of which should use the broken code. Other third-party browsers for Android may embed the broken AOSP code, and unfortunately for end users, there's no good way to know if this is the case or not.", "Misfit, the company behind the Shine activity tracker (our pick last year for the best tracker for those who swim), has officially unveiled its second-ever product. Meet the Misfit Flash. It's a full-featured waterproof sleep and fitness tracker with a killer price tag: $49.99.\n\nThe Misfit Flash connects to your Android or iOS smartphone using Bluetooth. The Flash tracks steps, distance and calories burned for all sorts of activities via its 3-axis accelerometer, from running to cycling to active sports. You can monitor this data through the included app, or by simply pressing the front face of the device to get a quick check of your progress toward your daily goals. You can even wear the device to bed if you choose, allowing it to track your sleep quality, too.\n\nThe Flash can be worn on your wrist like the Jawbone UP or Fitbit Flex using its included strap. Or, you can use the included clip to simply attach Flash to your pants or shirt, a good option for those of us who detest that rash-causing sweaty wristband feeling. Clipping a tracker to your clothes may not be optimal for accuracy, but I find that I'm more willing to wear one during everyday activity if I can hide it on myself.\n\nOne feature I really like about the Misfit Flash is the battery. The tracker uses a standard CR2032 coin cell - a watch battery - that requires replacement once every four months or so. It's certainly less of a hassle to deal with than charging the device every night. These batteries retail for less than $1 each at Amazon, so they're not a major added expense.\n\nBoth Apple and Google have promised huge pushes towards fitness tracking this year on their smartphones - Apple with its new Health tracker on the iPhone 6 and in iOS 8; and Google with its competing fitness data aggregator. You'll need a tracker to actually use the features, of course, and that's why I like the Flash. It's an inexpensive way to get started. I mean, let's be honest - $100 or $200 is a lot to spend on a new technology that just might not be for you.\n\nThe $49.99 Misfit Flash will be available in seven different colors at major retailers like Best Buy, Target, Amazon and Walmart this October. You can pre-order the device now at misfit.com/flash. Before you do, however, you may want to read this guide to learn what type of activity tracker is best for your lifestyle.", "The new tools link Jive with the cloud versions of Outlook, Office, SharePoint and OneDrive for Business\n\nJive has built links between its enterprise social networking (ESN) suite and Microsoft's Office 365 to let users leverage Jive collaboration features with the cloud versions of Outlook, Office, SharePoint and OneDrive for Business.\n\nESN vendors like Jive realized years ago that for their products to gain adoption in workplaces, they have to be threaded into the third-party applications that workers use every day, like the ones for email, CRM, ERP, accounting and the like. That way, users can tap their third-party software from within the Jive interface, and vice versa.\n\nESN software that is isolated from the daily-use business software of a company is unlikely to gain traction among users, because it becomes yet another stand-alone inbox of sorts that they need to check and maintain. In that sense, ESN software's adoption dynamics are different from the consumer market social media services it's modeled after, like Facebook and Twitter, which are at the center of the universe of complementary apps built around them.\n\nMost ESN software providers, then, build custom connectors for popular business software products. They also provide APIs (application programming interfaces) so that enterprise and commercial developers can create their own integrations. Jive has already developed connectors for products from a variety of other vendors, including Box, Cisco, Dropbox, Evernote, Google, Salesforce and, of course, Microsoft.\n\nHowever, previously rolled out integrations for Microsoft products, including Outlook, Lync, Office and SharePoint, were for their on-premises versions. The connectors announced Tuesday focus on cloud software, to which Microsoft is shifting its strategy.\n\nWith the new tools -- the Jive Connector for Outlook Online, Jive Connector for Office Online, and Jive Connector for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business -- Jive can position its ESN suite as able to assist Microsoft customers who are in increasingly common hybrid scenarios, meaning they're running both on-premises and cloud versions of these products simultaneously.\n\n\"We're where the users are,\" said Clara Liang [cq], Jive's chief product officer. \"We let them work where they prefer.\"\n\nAs an example, Liang told of a hypothetical scenario where \"John\" from the marketing department gets an email on Outlook.com with a question he can't answer, so with the new connector, he transforms the message into a discussion thread in Jive, and also uploads the attachment to the ESN suite. Since Jive is integrated with Salesforce.com, sales rep \"Gina\" sees the new discussion started by John and, because it concerns one of her clients, she provides the information he needs, at which point John is able to reply to the original email.\n\nJive already had an integration with Yammer, the cloud ESN software which Microsoft acquired in mid-2012 and which it has been integrating with its Office family of products. However, a connector for Lync Online hasn't been developed yet.\n\nJive, whose customers include T-Mobile, GE Healthcare, Eli Lilly, Prudential, Genentech, Vodafone and Nike, is one of the few remaining \"pure play\" ESN vendors. Its rivals include IBM's Connections, Salesforce.com's Chatter and Communities, Microsoft's Yammer and SharePoint, and Tibco's Tibbr.\n\nThe 13-year old company went public in late 2011, but its shares, which are trading in the $6.50 range, are way off from their April 2012 peak, when they topped $27. Second-quarter revenue grew 23 percent year-on-year to $43.4 million and its net loss was $14.6 million, about $3.2 million narrower than in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStill, Forrester Research ranked the company as a \"leader\" among enterprise social software vendors in a recent report, along with IBM, Salesforce, Microsoft, Zimbra and Tibco, saying that despite the \"crowded vendor landscape, Jive continues to thrive by emphasizing user experience across all devices.\"\n\nJuan Carlos Perez covers enterprise communication/collaboration suites, operating systems, browsers and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

Also: Tesla leads tech stocks to a rebound.\n\nThe Lead: Netflix lands in Europe, but will it succeed?\n\nMuch like the titular character in one of its upcoming shows, \"Marco Polo,\" introduced Europe to Asia hundreds of years ago, Netflix is bringing Silicon Valley-style video streaming to Europe.\n\nBut will anyone care?\n\nThe Los Gatos video-on-demand company launched its streaming service in Germany on Tuesday, a day after Netflix made its debut in France, where it already faces criticism. Next on the company's schedule are four more European countries -- Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.\n\nThe costly expansion is expected to net Netflix as many as 6 million new subscribers, more than 10 percent of its current streaming subscription base. However, the company could have issues finding that many new customers if its content isn't tailored to the wants and needs of the specific countries, analysts believe.\n\n\"Viewers will search for the shows they know, and if they can't find them, they'll never subscribe,\" Gilles Fontaine, a Digiworld analyst based in France, told Bloomberg News.\n\nWhile Netflix has secured the rights to a couple of German shows -- \"Stromberg\" and \"Der Tatortreiniger\" -- and plans an original show for the French market called \"Marseille,\" success or failure could depend on the popularity of its U.S.-focused original shows such as \"Orange is the New Black\" and second-run American TV shows it does not own the U.S. rights to, such as \"Modern Family.\"\n\n\"They're going to either thrive or fail based on their ability to pick the shows that work the best,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Bloomberg Television.\n\nCEO and co-founder Reed Hastings told Reuters in an interview that Netflix is looking long-term, with plans to add to its content lineup while attempting to convince French cable companies to provide access to Netflix through their cable boxes.\n\n\"After launch is when the real work begins: improving the content being offered and getting on set-top boxes,\" Hastings said.\n\nAs it spends big to expand into new countries, Netflix is still shoveling money at Hollywood for U.S. shows, as well. On Tuesday, the company announced that it had agreed to a two-season deal for a new television show from Judd Apatow, called \"Love.\"\n\nNetflix had to fight off Hulu for the show, Variety reported, and guaranteed two seasons to an untested show for the first time since it landed \"House of Cards,\" the Kevin Spacey-helmed show that was the original spark for Netflix's recent critical acclaim for original series. Apatow's track record as a producer and writer of comedies seemingly helped, with Netflix already showing his TV series from the early 2000s, \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"Undeclared\" -- both of those shows were canceled after one season.\n\n\"Netflix has been supportive in ways I couldn't create in my wildest fever dreams,\" Apatow said in Tuesday's announcement.\n\nNetflix stock dropped 0.2 percent to $456.91 on the day, and has fallen more than 4 percent so far this week.\n\nSV150 market report: Tesla bounces back along with Wall Street\n\nAfter Silicon Valley tech stocks slid hard Monday, Wall Street bounced back Tuesday with help from a Tesla Motors rebound.\n\nTesla had its worst day in months on Monday after a bullish analyst detailed the problems the Palo Alto carmaker has, but gained 2.7 percent to $260.74 Tuesday after a separate analyst checked in on the stock. ISI established coverage of Tesla on Tuesday, giving the stock a price target of $320 -- the same as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas -- and refuting at least a couple of issues Jonas brought up in his note on Monday. While Jonas considered other manufacturers' focus on hydrogen fuel cells to be a minus for Tesla, as it could stunt growth of electric-vehicle infrastructure and demand, ISI predicted that battery power would eventually win out and help Tesla. Jonas also doubted Tesla's entry into China, but ISI wrote, \"Examining China's electric vehicle policy, it is difficult to foresee an OEM better placed than Tesla to assist the government in meeting its (clean fuel vehicle) goals.\"Tesla CEO Elon Musk had more to celebrate than a stock gain Tuesday, as his SpaceX space-exploration company shared a big government contract to take U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nApple went against the grain and dropped 0.8 percent to $100.86 after the Subway food chain announced the impending arrival of NFC charge terminals, which should boost the coming Apple Pay mobile payments service, which is already being attacked by eBay's PayPal; eBay gained 1.3 percent to $51.61. Adobe announced earnings after the bell, and investors didn't like the San Jose company's results, as shares dipped more than 4 percent in late trading after gaining 0.7 percent to $70.73 in the regular session. Yelp fell 0.1 percent to $76.54 after the San Francisco online reviews company was hit with a federal lawsuit claiming it collected information from children without parental consent. Google increased 1.2 percent to $588.78 while receiving the bulk of California's first permits for self-driving cars, and Symantec added 0.1 percent to $24.21 after changing its search filters to stop blocking gay websites.

The court is hearing the state's appeal of a February ruling by U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia that declared Texas' ban against gay marriage as unconstitutional.\n\nAlso filing briefs in support of the same-sex couple plaintiffs by Tuesday night's deadline were 200 clergy members, including Episcopal Bishop Scott Mayer of a diocese covering the Panhandle, Lubbock and Abilene; major corporations, including Cisco, Alcoa, Pfizer, Target, Intel, Google and Staples; and about 10 other groups.\n\nLast month, Republican lieutenant governor candidate Dan Patrick and GOP attorney general nominee Ken Paxton joined 61 legislative colleagues in signing a Texas Conservative Coalition brief that it was \"entirely rational public policy\" to oppose dissolving the gay marriage ban because recognition of same sex unions might lead to recognition of incest, pedophilia and polygamy.\n\nDemocrats Valdez and Garcia joined a brief by active and retired Texas police, prison security personnel, firefighters and paramedics saying the ban denies \"peace of mind\" and dignity to gay and lesbian public safety officers.\n\nTheir partners can't qualify for the state's $250,000 death benefits for police and firefighters who die in the line of duty. Nor can their children receive free tuition and fees at state colleges and universities, as the children of heterosexual officers do after such tragedies. Only in late July, after an action by the U.S. Department of Justice, did Texas public safety officers who are gay and lesbian gain the ability for their partners to qualify for federal death benefits of more than $333,000, the brief said. But they still have to travel to a state that allows gay marriage and get married there, it said -- something straight couples don't have to do.\n\nIf gay and lesbian public safety officers in Texas remain in the closet, the brief notes, their partners may not be notified if there is a medical emergency. More ominously, it says, the state's discrimination may permeate police and fire departments and emergency services districts and convey a message that the gay and lesbian employees \"do not deserve the same degree of respect and dignity as their heterosexual colleagues.\" That could lead to concerns about \"whether their heterosexual colleagues would provide backup in dangerous situations,\" the brief warns.\n\n\"In sum, the ability of a gay and lesbian officer to marry would not only allow them to be treated equally with their peers, ... but would also ensure them the peace of mind of knowing that the person they love will be\n\ncared for if they are killed in the line of duty,\" it said.\n\nThe final brief in the case now falls to Abbott. In late July, he filed a brief criticizing Orlando Garcia for overstepping his bounds. Abbott said voters and lawmakers in the 50 states should decide whether to allow gay marriage. He noted Texas voters approved the current ban when they passed a constitutional amendment by better than 3-to-1 in 2005.\n\nAbbott also argued that Texas' interest was to encourage procreation, which could not naturally happen between same-sex spouses. Gay marriage is not a \"fundamental right\" because it's not deeply rooted in the country's traditions, he said.\n\nLast week, though a lawyer for the plaintiff couples, who include lawyer Mark Phariss and physician assistant Victor Holmes of Plano, accused Abbott of echoing arguments used unsuccessfully nearly 50 years ago to try to defend Virginia's ban on interracial marriage.\n\nAbbott has until Sept. 26 to respond.

It said the Asia Pacific market is set to grow at a pace of 3.4 percent through to 2018 but that North American revenues will fall 4.2 percent over the same period \"as the migration of advertising and readers to digital continues.\"", "Google Fiber has a new boss, the latest sign that the search giant is serious about delivering high-speed Internet service.\n\nFormer Qualcomm executive Dennis Kish replaced Milo Medin, a key visionary behind the project. Medin remains a Google vice president for access services and adviser to the Google Fiber team, a spokeswoman said, while working on other, unspecified Internet-access projects for the company.\n\nKish was brought in for his operational expertise and will lead Google Fiber as the high-speed Internet and television service expands to new cities.\n\nGoogle has faced questions about whether the Fiber service is a full-fledged business, or an effort to prod existing Internet service providers to boost speeds -- and thus consumption of Google services like search and YouTube.\n\nGoogle Fiber offers Internet connections at one gigabit per second, about 100 times faster than typical broadband connections. It offers service in the Kansas City and Provo, Utah areas, and is preparing to expand to Austin, Texas. Google has said it is considering expanding to as many as 34 more towns and cities, including Atlanta and Phoenix.\n\nOther telecom companies are accelerating their own very-high-speed fiber networks. AT&T plans to expand its \"GigaPower\" fiber-optic network in six areas that Google marked for Fiber expansion.\n\nKish reports to Craig Barratt, Google's senior vice president, access and energy. Chief Executive Larry Page recently added Barratt to his top circle of advisers, known internally as \"L Team,\" joining the executives that run other key Google divisions like search, advertising, Android and YouTube.\n\nGoogle Fiber is the most advanced project under Barratt's supervision.

(Mark Wilson / Getty Images)\n\nGoogle Inc., with its vision for a future where cars drive themselves, is putting itself at odds with an auto industry that shares its desire for safer, less-congested roads -- yet won't abide the \"driverless\" part.\n\nThe clash pits the Internet giant, public for barely a decade, against companies that spent a century building the machines that put people behind the wheel of autos. As Google works to perfect a system in research labs and road tests to minimize the involvement of drivers, automakers spend billions of dollars annually on ads to do the opposite. Think BMW and its claims to the Ultimate Driving Machine, or Volkswagen and its Drivers Wanted sales pitch.\n\nThe differences are more than philosophical.\n\nGoogle is sweeping up top talent and research, powered by an almost $400 billion stock-market value that tops those of Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. combined. It's also keeping a tight grip on its mapping data and potential marketing plans for cars while helping to create what many in the auto industry consider unrealistic expectations for how quickly cars can safely become wholly driverless.\n\n\"Clearly there's some sort of tension there,\" said Richard Wallace, director of transportation systems analysis at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Google's splashy displays of technology \"lead to expectations creep that's probably unrealistic in some ways,\" he said.\n\nGoogle's aloofness was on display at last week's Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit. The search giant had minimal presence at the annual event where automakers hash out standards for the technology that would keep, at the center of it all, the driver.\n\nAmong the advancements automakers announced at last week's conference in Detroit was GM's \"Super Cruise\" system for 2017 Cadillacs, which will let drivers take their hands off the steering wheel and feet from pedals for periods of highway driving. Like technology being developed by Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and other companies, GM's system hands control back and forth between driver and vehicle.\n\nThe approach that Google is taking is, literally, much more hands-off. In May it unveiled plans to deploy at least 100 fully autonomous, two-seat, egg-shaped test cars with a top speed of 25 miles per hour and no steering wheel. Google has since said it will include one, as well as brake and gas pedals, as California requires.\n\nAided by early staffing with top Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University scientists who won a U.S.-backed driverless vehicle challenge in 2005, Google recruited dozens of robotics and artificial-intelligence researchers, and is adding more.\n\nGoogle has won or applied for 96 autonomous-driving patents since 2011 and has hired talent from Toyota, BMW AG, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and even Silicon Valley upstart Tesla Motors Inc., according to LinkedIn profiles. For high-level advice, Google can turn to former Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally, now a board member.\n\nIt's also backed by more than $60 billion in cash, more than any individual automaker can muster.\n\n\"When you're at Google's scale you do plenty of things that disrupt or change the environment,\" said Frank Gillett, analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"We now have a race for who's going to build the software and services platform that operates driverless cars.\"\n\nWhile the effort is still in an early phase, executives including co-founder Sergey Brin have committed Google to making driverless cars a reality. They tout societal benefits of robotic cars, such as a transportation option for the blind and elderly.\n\nTo traditional manufacturers, anything that makes human drivers superfluous is automotive heresy.\n\n\"Driving is essentially very fun,\" Ken Koibuchi, general manager of intelligent vehicle development for Toyota, said in an interview in Detroit this month. For that and reasons including liability issues in the case of an accident and yet-to-be-set regulations, the world's largest carmaker isn't planning a driverless car even as it adds automated features.\n\nNissan Motor Co., Mercedes and Tesla are among those that have said they'll add self-driving features by end of the decade. None has said how much it's spending to do that.\n\n\"They've kind of shamed the automakers into investing more money into this,\" said Egil Juliussen, research director for advanced driving systems for IHS Automotive.\n\nWhile Google's cash pile tops that of individual automakers, Toyota's $41 billion, Volkswagen's $44 billion and GM's $29 billion ensure they can fund advances.\n\nGoogle so far hasn't specified whether it will build and sell driverless cars; create a service using such vehicles; or supply its driverless technology to the auto industry.", "An error has occurred and your email has not been sent.\n\nPlease try again.\n\nThe main stock market story these days is the Standard & Poor's 500 index's record-setting pace, even in the face of rising political and military tensions around the globe.\n\nBut there's more to the stock market than the S&P 500. And as Bloomberg points out in a solid bit of enterprise, the problem with many stocks in the tech-heavy Nasdaq may suggest that the appetite for risk is diminishing among investors.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq overall has outperformed the broader stock market over the past six months, Bloomberg reports that 47% of stocks in the Nasdaq Composite index are down at least 20% from their peak in the last 12 months while more than 40% have fallen that much in the Russell 2000 index and the Bloomberg IPO index.\n\n\"That contrasts with the S&P 500, which has closed at new highs 33 times in 2014 and where less than 6% of companies are in bear markets, data compiled by Bloomberg show,\" the article says.\n\nBloomberg\n\nWhat the Nasdaq Is Telling Us\n\nThe Bloomberg writers, Lu Wang and Joseph Ciolli, point out that the divergence between the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq shows that the appetite for risk is narrowing as the Federal Reserve reins in economic stimulus after a five-year rally.\n\nThe article quotes Skip Aylesworth, a portfolio manager for Hennessy Funds, who argues that investors are starting to avoid \"companies that will suffer the most when the market stumbles.\"\n\nRisk tolerance appears to be on the decline on the eve of the public-market's debut of Alibaba Group Holding, the Chinese Internet colossus that could be the third most valuable Internet company behind Google and Facebook. The stock is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange this Friday with the ticker BABA.\n\nNeedless to say, the opinions of how Alibaba perform vary widely.\n\nOver the weekend, Barron's magazine featured an article by Associate Editor Andrew Bary suggesting that the stock, assuming that it comes to market with a value of $160 billion, could \"easily jump 20% or more.\"\n\n\"The combination of high growth, strong profitability, a huge market opportunity, and a reasonable valuation at about 23 times next fiscal year's estimated earnings should translate into ample demand when Alibaba debuts late this week, selling 320 million American depositary shares in a range of $60 to $66 a share,\" writes Bary.\n\nHis positive view is echoed by Eric Jackson, a money manager who also writes for The Street.\n\nBut then Jackson has skin in the game because he owns a stake in Yahoo! (ticker: YHOO), which owns a sizable stake in Alibaba.\n\nBut anyone considering investing in Alibaba would be well served by reading a column by Jason Zweig, the veteran personal-finance columnist with The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nAnalyzing the Alibaba IPO\n\n\"Investors have a natural tendency to think of each company going public as a special case,\" writes Zweig. \"But you will get a clearer sense of what to expect for Alibaba's IPO if you think of it not as a unique case but rather as part of a class, meaning a broader set of similar companies.\"\n\nZweig argues that Alibaba's size is encouraging. \"Companies that are already large when they go public tend to perform better after the IPO,\" he writes.\n\nHowever, he writes, \"You could also consider Alibaba as a member of the class of Chinese companies going public in the U.S. Here the picture is less rosy: Chinese listings on U.S. exchanges have underperformed the overall U.S. stock market by an average of around nine percentage points annually in the three years after their IPOs.\"\n\nZweig's piece is hardly conclusive, but it does provide a reader with a framework for viewing the stock that I haven't seen elsewhere.\n\nI'll close this column with some reaction to a seismic event in the history of hedge funds: the Monday announcement by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) that it would shed its entire $4 billion investment in hedge funds over the next year.\n\nIn making the announcement, the fund's interim chief investment officer cited the complexity and high costs of these funds.\n\nA number of Websites have weighed in with reaction to this news and none of it is encouraging for the hedge fund industry, which has been losing its luster in recent years. A decent piece on the Abnormal Returns Website, appropriately titled, \"The Beginning of the End of the Hedge Fund Gravy Train,\" does a nice job of summarizing the reaction.\n\nWriting on the Bloomberg View site, Barry Ritholtz, a longtime critic of the hedge fund industry, argues that the implications of \"the California earthquake for hedge funds\" could be far reaching.\n\n\"What will other pension funds do?\" Ritholtz asks. \"Calpers has long been known as an industry thought leader. Along with its sheer size, it also has used its status and location in the progressive and experimental state of California to manage things a little differently from the pack.\"\n\nHe also wonders what the Calpers news does to the belief that hedge funds are superior to conventional stock investing. \"This expectation, of course, has proven to be a myth,\" adds Ritholtz. \"But state treasurers bought into this fiction because it allowed them to make much smaller contributions to employee-retirement accounts, keeping local tax rates down.

Here are nine essential tips.\n\nIt might sound like a clich\u00e9 if I say that the world is shifting towards mobile. That would have been pretty correct three years ago. But today, it is evident that we have already shifted towards mobile.\n\nOne in every four searches happens on mobile, with 50 percent of mobile searchers using their device at the start of the search process and 88 percent using smartphones to conduct local searches.\n\nAs mobile is growing, marketers need be smart enough to optimize their mobile site by doing the right mobile SEO.\n\nYes, mobile SEO is slightly different from what is done for desktop, and it is important to understand that the way people search on mobile is different from how they search on desktop. In fact, Google recently announced separate changes for mobile and desktop in its search quality updates. Including:\n\nMore Localized Results: For mobile search results, Google places listings - now known as Google My Business - tend to appear more numerously than desktop search results. And it means results for mobile searches are more likely to be localized. Moreover, there is a greater chance of websites with local intent to have higher rankings than those with non-local intent.\n\nDifferent Levels of Engagement: Mobile users have different levels of engagement compared with desktop users. A drop from first to fourth position on a mobile phone can mean a CTR drop-off of up to 90 percent.\n\nRanking Algorithms Are Different: Mobile search uses different ranking algorithms from desktop searches. Location is one of the key factors that can change the mobile search results for different users.\n\nDifferent Search Behavior: Mobile users have different search intent as compared to desktop users. There is more urgency of action.\n\nHere is a list of some best practices in ensuring mobile SEO success for your site.\n\n1. Redirects That Work on Mobiles:\n\nMake sure you are redirecting your users to the correct URL when they are trying to access your site from a mobile. To serve users the correct version of your website, I advise redirects based on user agent. Use server-side redirects (301s or 302s) instead of JavaScript redirects. Google also recently updated its Site Move Help documentation, recommending the use of 301 for mobile redirects.\n\nUse a crawler like Screaming Frog to check how Googlebot mobile crawls your site. It gives the Redirects Chains report showing the chains of redirects, the number of hops, as well as identifying the source and whether there is a loop.\n\n2. Optimize Embedded Videos and Images\n\nMake sure your visual content is optimized for mobile devices. Keep them responsive. Make sure that no elements on your site rely on Flash. While iPhones can't render Flash at all, it is also very slow on Android devices. Instead of using Flash for videos, use HTML5. Test all video content after uploading to ensure the best user experience. Use a mobile emulator like the Opera Mobile Emulator to check how your web content is displayed and executed. You can check your text, menu, images and videos.\n\n3. Test Page Load Speed\n\n74 percent of users leave the site if it is taking more than five seconds for a page to load. Make sure your site loads quickly on mobile. Use Google's PageSpeed Insight tools to check your page load time. The PageSpeed Insights mobile filter will not only verify your mobile site speed but also give you recommendations on how to improve it.\n\nIf your page speed is slow, you can try compressing large images and check whether other on-page elements like JavaScript and videos are optimized for mobile or not.\n\n4. Mobile Sitemaps\n\nCreate an XML sitemap for your mobile site, and submit it to Google and Bing. Keep mobile pages separate from desktop pages. By keeping the two separate, you can find out whether there is any indexation issue in mobile pages as compared to the desktop pages. You should also check if Googlebot is encountering any possible issues crawling your site by using Google Webmaster Tools.\n\nClick on Crawl > Crawl Errors and choose the Smartphone tab. On the Webmaster Tools dashboard click on Fetch as Google, enter the URL and click on Fetch.\n\nThis will give you a report on how Googlebot fetched your page. Verify the HTTP status code and HTML you are providing to Googlebot.\n\n5. Don't Forget Local\n\nAccording to Google, around 50 percent of mobile search happens with a local intent.\n\nSo don't forget to optimize your mobile site for local search and use appropriate structured data markup wherever possible. Make sure your site is submitted on Google My Business if you are a local business and keep the following information clearly visible on your site: physical address, hours of operation and contact information.\n\n6. Optimize Your Content\n\nOptimize your web content with relevant keywords and strategically place them throughout your pages. Use the Google Keyword tool to verify the keywords mobile search volume.\n\nYou can also use other keyword tools like Ubbersuggest and Keywordtool.io and to identify relevant keywords to your website. Apart from this, try to avoid using ads and pop up windows and remove unnecessary images as they slow the page load time.\n\n7. Conversational Tone and Voice Search\n\nAs more and more people are using voice search, an SEO strategy that promotes your specific location and uses conversational search terms in the content is becoming crucial.\n\n8. Mobile Friendly Meta Tags\n\nMake sure your meta tags are formatted in a mobile friendly style. I would recommend keeping your title tags within 40-60 characters and meta descriptions within 90 characters. Use User-Agent Switcher Add-On for Chrome to check your mobile search results. Compare the titles, descriptions, URLs, snippets from mobile and desktop search results.\n\n9. Clear Design Focused on Usability\n\nKeep your mobile site design intuitive and easy to navigate. Use clear call to actions to increase your site's ability to engage and convert visitors into prospects. Avoid unnecessary design elements and make sure that all-important information is clearly visible and easy to find. Once you have optimized your pages, you can use Google Analytics to track your mobile traffic data.\n\nClick on: Acquisition>All Traffic>Medium>Organic Search Traffic>Add a Segment>Mobile Traffic and Tablet Traffic, and click on apply.\n\nThis will give you a graph showing your mobile traffic. Via \"Select Dimensions\" you can choose different devices or models to compare traffic and find out your best landing pages.\n\nThis report will be helpful to understanding how your mobile site is performing and how much traffic it is driving.\n\nWith the growing use of smartphones, designing a website that is friendly to the smartphone users has become important. If your SEO strategy does not cover mobile search, you still have a lot to do. Once you have launched your mobile optimized website, make sure you have got all the above mentioned points ticked to ensure mobile SEO success for your website.\n\nDo you have further tips for the list?

It also comes as the Internet and social media have become a tool during the continued political standoff between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe deal for Vkontakte, which has more than 60 million Russian users compared with Facebook's 10 million users in the country, also ends tensions between Alisher B. Usmanov, the Russian billionaire who controls Mail.ru, and Vkontakte's minority shareholders, including the local investor United Capital Partners.\n\nBoth sides have clashed over how best to develop the Russian social network, and have been embroiled in a recent lengthy legal dispute over who owns the Internet company.\n\nThe uncertainty over Vkontakte's future had led Pavel Durov, the social network's young founder regarded as Russia's equivalent to Mark Zuckerberg, to resign briefly this year, only to subsequently change his mind about leaving his post.\n\nAs part of the deal announced Tuesday, Mail.ru said that it had bought the outstanding 48 percent stake in Vkontakte, also known as VK, that it did not already own for $1.47 billion from companies connected to United Capital Partners.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Mail.ru, United Capital Partners and Mr. Durov also said that they had agreed to end their legal disputes over Vkontakte.\n\n\"We respect the successful results driven by VK's team and do not plan any significant changes in the team or the product itself,\" Mail.ru's chief executive, Dmitry Grishin, said in a statement.\n\nThe company's share price rose 3.3 percent in afternoon trading in London on Tuesday.\n\nMail.ru's acquisition of Russia's largest social network, however, has raised concerns about Internet freedom in the country.\n\nDuring local protests in 2011 and 2012, Vkontakte had provided a platform for many anti-government campaigners to voice their concerns.\n\nYet Mr. Usmanov is seen as an ally to Vladimir Putin, and analysts say that the acquisition could potentially lead to a clampdown against anti-government dissent.\n\nThe success of Vkontakte, which started in 2006 and now has roughly 240 million registered users, comes despite strong competition from Western rivals, including Facebook, to break into the Russian market.\n\nAlthough the likes of Google and Facebook have come to dominate many parts of the Internet, Russian Internet companies - including the search engine Yandex - have held on to much of the local market, often expanding into other areas like e-commerce and financial services.", "KYOTO - The Kyoto District Court is set to rule on a lawsuit Wednesday over a man's demand that the Japan arm of Google Inc. delete its results for Internet browser searches using his name because they mentioned his past criminal record, thus violating his privacy.\n\nThe man in his 40s in the city of Kyoto has lodged a similar lawsuit againt Yahoo Japan, but the Kyoto District Court rejected his demand last month.

Because the next set of problems Apple has to solve is so much less fun than the last.\n\nThe Macintosh made you a painter. The iPod put 1,000 songs in your pocket. The iPhone turned us all into amateur photographers. Then the iPad offered up a blank canvas limited only by imagination.\n\nNow what does the Apple Watch do? Functionally, its biggest breakthrough is that it can pay for things very conveniently, with just a tap of the wrist. Its biggest advertised feature is by all measures and accounts, boring.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple's success can be attributed to, as Steve Jobs put it, design innovations that live specifically at the intersection between technology and liberal arts. To be fair, the Apple Watch doesn't solve these types of problems, in part, because Apple has already solved so many of them. They already made the connected world accessible from your pocket. They already gave us a portable screen that we could draw pretty well on. The world will never be blown away by an MP3 player again. That moment came and went.\n\nI was disappointed by the Apple Watch announcement for the same reasons you may have been. Its industrial design, while featuring thoughtful elements like a magnetic clasp, easily swappable bands, and that clever \"digital crown\" navigation system, ostensibly resembled the smartwatches we've already seen from companies like Samsung and Motorola--as if Apple showed up casually late to a party they were too cool for, only to realize, everybody else there was wearing its same shoes. I mean, the iPhone floored you the first time you saw it, as if Apple had traveled to the future and stolen it back for all of us to share. The Apple Watch was a Samsung Galaxy Gear dipped in rose gold, the blush wine of the precious metal world.\n\nBut the bigger reason to be disappointed--the one that matters beyond my personal taste or our insatiable thirst for the new--is that the Apple Watch isn't connected to anything particularly beautiful or fun. Think about it: Every major Apple release has been grounded in some landmark support of multimedia, helpfully enabled by a breakthrough in user interaction. The Macintosh let you paint because it made your hand feel like a natural extension of the cursor on-screen. The iPod paired a deeply organized music collection with a wheel that could explore artists, albums, genres, and individual tracks with equal grace.\n\nWhether it was the iPad's touchscreen, or the iPod's music library, Apple devices either made you an artist, or gave you a better way to consume art. But the closest the Apple Watch comes to this idea is allowing you control your music from your wrist or scribble a doodle to beam to a friend. Nothing about the Apple Watch will fundamentally shift the way we experience TV, movies, photos or music. The Apple Watch has little appreciation for art or creativity.\n\nSo what design challenges lay ahead for Apple? Boring ones. Taking a cue from the Apple Watch, you see two highly lucrative, infrastructure-level problems: payments and health. They're certainly important problems worthy of Apple's attention, but that doesn't make them fun.\n\nPayments is the ultimate snoozefest. Yes, our credit card infrastructure is decades old. No, it's probably not secure enough to protect our accounts in the digital age. Yes, there is a better way. And Apple, by making deals with the likes of Visa and Mastercard, will be giving it to us because it will make them a whole lot of money, and the logical point of, why shouldn't your phone double as your wallet? We'll all use it, but nobody will be amazed because payments are boring.\n\nThe second big solution is health tracking. Health is really important. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. And maybe, just maybe, Apple can manage to exchange and combine my vitals with the data my health provider has to offer some kind of realtime analytics. I can barely begin to comprehend how important that could be. Building the right digital health is one of the biggest design, political, and infrastructural challenges of the modern era. But health data is boring. And when it isn't boring, it's worse; it's depressing or even devastating.\n\nDesign has evolved at breakneck speeds in the last decade, and we largely have Apple to thank for that, for lighting a fire under the entire industry of electronics manufacturers to think of their esoteric gadgets as fun, approachable experiences that can bring new moments of joy to our lives.\n\nHowever, Apple will have a tougher time standing out to consumers over the next decade because so many of the fun problems have already been solved. And the problems that remain are just as much, if not more, about solving boring infrastructural issues than they are about designing experiences that are truly new.\n\nWhy doesn't the Apple Watch truly revolutionize payments? Why doesn't it let us buy a can of Campbell's soup just by removing it from the shelf at a Walmart? The technology is capable. Apple's designers are more than clever enough to think up that idea, too.\n\nBut even if Apple has the innovative ideas, the infrastructure won't allow it yet. Walmart hasn't lined its shelves with NFC receivers, and who knows, maybe it would upset Visa for some reason, too. As a result of infrastructure, Apple's new shiny wallet on your wrist ends up looking just like Google's old tattered thing in your pocket.\n\nAnd after payments and health, consider what future issues are next: education, finances, environmental footprint, governmental communications, data security, and personal safety.\n\nThese ideas aren't fun. No silhouetted model wearing earbuds will ever be spotted dancing to the beat of your heart. But sometimes even the cool kids should stop having fun and tackle some of the world's real problems. And this begs the question: will the masses keep buying Apple products along the way?", "Chromecast continues to improve as a media streaming device as Google has revealed that it now supports WATCH Disney, Twitch, iHeart Radio, and DramaFever.

Today's announcement adds support for Disney, Disney Jr, Disney XD, iHeart Radio, DramaFever, and most surprising of all - Twitch.\n\nChromecast support is slowly becoming the standard in streaming media apps, and with good reason. While Google's HDMI stick had a bumpy start, the platform has a reputation for just working out of the box now. The system updates on its own, works with almost everything, and almost never needs to be messed with. Plus, we know thanks to the addition of Android TV that the service has a platform to grow into when Google feels the need to address things like 1080p and 4K streaming over WiFi. Today's additions are significant because these apps mostly target non-techy groups of users, and having the Disney streamers of the world using a Chromecast is a big deal to Google.\n\nMore than that, of course, is the importance of Twitch support. Google supposedly backed out of a bid for Twitch last month to Amazon, and one of the first things to come from every tech blogger around was how unlikely it was that Twitch would ever support Chromecast streaming officially after Google lost that bid. It turns out Chromecast streaming was already in the works over at Twitch, and now you can just tap the Chromecast button from within the app and see your favorite game on the TV.\n\nWho knows, maybe Amazon will see how cool it is and add Instant Video support for Chromecast soon.", "Jive has built links between its enterprise social networking (ESN) suite and Microsoft's Office 365 to let users leverage Jive collaboration features with the cloud versions of Outlook, Office, SharePoint and OneDrive for Business.\n\nESN vendors like Jive realized years ago that for their products to gain adoption in workplaces, they have to be threaded into the third-party applications that workers use every day, like the ones for email, CRM, ERP, accounting and the like. That way, users can tap their third-party software from within the Jive interface, and vice versa.\n\nESN software that is isolated from the daily-use business software of a company is unlikely to gain traction among users, because it becomes yet another stand-alone inbox of sorts that they need to check and maintain. In that sense, ESN software's adoption dynamics are different from the consumer market social media services it's modeled after, like Facebook and Twitter, which are at the center of the universe of complementary apps built around them.\n\nMost ESN software providers, then, build custom connectors for popular business software products. They also provide APIs (application programming interfaces) so that enterprise and commercial developers can create their own integrations. Jive has already developed connectors for products from a variety of other vendors, including Box, Cisco, Dropbox, Evernote, Google, Salesforce and, of course, Microsoft.\n\nHowever, previously rolled out integrations for Microsoft products, including Outlook, Lync, Office and SharePoint, were for their on-premises versions. The connectors announced Tuesday focus on cloud software, to which Microsoft is shifting its strategy.\n\nWith the new tools -- the Jive Connector for Outlook Online, Jive Connector for Office Online, and Jive Connector for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business -- Jive can position its ESN suite as able to assist Microsoft customers who are in increasingly common hybrid scenarios, meaning they're running both on-premises and cloud versions of these products simultaneously.\n\n\"We're where the users are,\" said Clara Liang [cq], Jive's chief product officer. \"We let them work where they prefer.\"\n\nAs an example, Liang told of a hypothetical scenario where \"John\" from the marketing department gets an email on Outlook.com with a question he can't answer, so with the new connector, he transforms the message into a discussion thread in Jive, and also uploads the attachment to the ESN suite. Since Jive is integrated with Salesforce.com, sales rep \"Gina\" sees the new discussion started by John and, because it concerns one of her clients, she provides the information he needs, at which point John is able to reply to the original email.\n\nJive already had an integration with Yammer, the cloud ESN software which Microsoft acquired in mid-2012 and which it has been integrating with its Office family of products. However, a connector for Lync Online hasn't been developed yet.\n\nJive, whose customers include T-Mobile, GE Healthcare, Eli Lilly, Prudential, Genentech, Vodafone and Nike, is one of the few remaining \"pure play\" ESN vendors. Its rivals include IBM's Connections, Salesforce.com's Chatter and Communities, Microsoft's Yammer and SharePoint, and Tibco's Tibbr.\n\nThe 13-year old company went public in late 2011, but its shares, which are trading in the $6.50 range, are way off from their April 2012 peak, when they topped $27.

It's a legal strategy that could be attractive to other cash-strapped cities, but one that experts say will face hurdles in court.\n\nOn Tuesday, health commissioners from Chicago, New York and Boston came to Washington to lobby Congress and the White House on efforts to combat prescription opioid abuse, which is blamed for 17,000 deaths per year -- more than three times as many as either heroin or cocaine.\n\n---\n\nUS tobacco growers brace for tougher competition\n\nDANVILLE, Va.

He claimed that Tiranium abused various online malware-checking websites to bolster its detection rate. His note included links to videos showing an older version of the software connecting to VirusTotal, in particular (though he admitted there is no longer a direct connection). He also supplied what he said were a number of emails from VirusTotal to Tiranium demanding they stop abusing the service.\n\nI checked with VirusTotal, but my contact declined to comment for publication. I had to determine for myself whether this was true, and whether it constituted a problem if so.\n\nWhat Is VirusTotal\n\nFor those who aren't familiar with it, VirusTotal's public face is a website where you can upload a file to see if it's malicious. The site first generates a hash for the file -- a unique mathematical fingerprint. If the hash is already in its database (and most are) it returns the stored results. If not, it checks the file with about 50 major antivirus engines, reporting which flagged the file as malicious. Google acquired VirusTotal about two years ago.\n\nThe service goes beyond simply checking files. According to its website, \"VirusTotal's mission is to help in improving the antivirus and security industry and make the internet a safer place through the development of free tools and services.\" That same page states that \"None of the services or applications publicly offered on this site should be used in commercial products, commercial services or for any business purpose. In the same way, none of the services should be used as a substitute for security products.\"\n\nIn other words, a product that simply used VirusTotal's results without independently verifying that the file is malicious would be violating the terms of service. And indeed, a controversial test by Kaspersky Lab several years ago showed that blindly using detection from the website is a bad idea.\n\nDigging With WireShark\n\nAccording to Malware1, Tiranium first checks a suspect file using its locally installed client. If there's no match, it checks the file's hash on VirusTotal. Only if it gets no results from VirusTotal does it invoke its own behavioral cloud scanner.\n\nTo start my investigation, I created brand-new modified versions of my current malware collection, changing the filenames, altering the file size, and tweaking some non-executable bytes. I checked the hash of each file against VirusTotal, to be sure all were absent from the database.\n\nWith the WireShark network traffic tracing utility running, I launched a Tiranium scan of the folder containing these files. Strangely, the scan ran for hours but never finished, and the count of files scanned never changed from its initial zero. I learned later that this was because the behavioral cloud server was down for several hours.\n\nIndeed, perusing the WireShark log I could see that Tiranium tried again and again to upload files to the behavioral cloud, each attempt ending in an error. What I did not find was any evidence of a direct connection to VirusTotal, or to any of the other services that had allegedly been used in the past.\n\nCircumstantial Evidence\n\nI moved some of my test files to another folder and submitted them to VirusTotal for checking. In every case a majority of the antivirus engines detected them as malicious; some got near-unanimous recognition as malware.\n\nAs soon as all the files were processed by VirusTotal, I immediately scanned the folder with Tiranium. This time it recognized those files as malware right away. When I scanned the remaining files, the ones I hadn't uploaded, the scan stuck, as before. While there was still no direct connection from my computer to VirusTotal, it seems I had established a clear chain of causality.\n\nMaybe It's OK?\n\nI reached out to my connections in the antivirus industry to see what they thought. One researcher pointed out that antivirus companies can contract with VirusTotal to automatically receive any sample that others detected but their product missed. However, that didn't seem to describe the situation I observed.\n\nMore importantly, my Tiranium contact confirmed the use of VirusTotal. \"VirusTotal has specific terms of use,\" he said. \"They're sending samples to companies. Tiranium is one of the companies analyzing that, like all others.\" He went on to note that the time to analyze new samples can vary. \"Sometimes this will take hours, sometime minutes, sometime days,\" he said.\n\nOr Maybe Not\n\nThe VirusTotal credits page lists all vendors who have \"integrated a product, tool or resource in VirusTotal, or have contributed somehow.\" These vendors have signed an agreement that includes a set of best practices. Tiranium is not among the companies listed. It's not receiving samples from VirusTotal, so its use is not \"like all the others.\"\n\nI've determined to my own satisfaction that the emails supplied by Malware1 telling Tiranium to stop misusing VirusTotal are real. I've seen evidence that at one time the application itself connected directly to VirusTotal for information, which is definitely abuse. But is its current incarnation stealing the work of other vendors, as Malware1 contends? I can't say definitively, but my trust is definitely shaken.\n\nPotentially Unwanted?\n\nApparently I'm not alone. In a discussion on the well-regarded Wilders Security forum, several members express concern about the product. In fact, at the time of this discussion about eight months ago, a number of well-known antivirus products detected Tiranium as a \"potentially unwanted application\" that should be removed.\n\nEven now, Kaspersky detects one of Tiranium's two main files as malware, and ESET detects them both. Fortinet identifies Tiranium's website as malicious, as does Webroot's BrightCloud service.\n\nShady Behaviors\n\nI pointed out this detection to my Kaspersky contact and asked if he could explain why Tiranium was flagged as malware. He dug into the question with significantly more skill than I could muster, and came up with a lot. \"They're using more than five different obfuscators to obfuscate their code and there's no digital signature,\" he said \"It's a little crazy and looks far from legit.\" There's no smoking gun here, but these and other malware-like behaviors were sufficient to get the product flagged. He also found traffic from the server referencing VT (VirusTotal), Anubis, and VirScan, suggesting some kind of reliance on third-party sources.\n\nThe BrightCloud folks couldn't pinpoint the reason that Tiranium's website got flagged as risky. However, they pointed out that Tiranium's IP address is shared with quite a few phishing websites. Google's safe browsing page for the olympe.in domain used by Tiranium had some alarming news: \"Of the 1341 pages we tested on the site over the past 90 days, 13 page(s) resulted in malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent.\"\n\nI said in my review that Tiranium is a good first effort, but not ready to challenge our several Editors' Choice antivirus products. I now feel that the company needs to both improve the product and regain my trust with professionalism and transparency. Fix the spelling and grammar errors, ditch the obfuscation, digitally sign the executable files, and make sure it integrates with Windows's Action Center. Refrain from any use of third-party products that isn't fully transparent. Separate Web hosting from servers that host malware. For now, I recommend that you stick with our Editors' Choice antivirus products.", "The School Fund, founded by college student Matt Severson in 2010, allows a donor to provide financial assistance to a worthy student anywhere in the world.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Palo Alto, Calif., in 2007, Matt Severson accompanied his mother on a safari to Tanzania in East Africa.\n\nOutside his hotel room one day he spotted a boy tending a cow. Striking up a conversation he learned that the boy, John Medo, had just graduated from primary school. His goal, the boy told him, was to become president of Tanzania someday.\n\nBut Mr. Severson also learned that, as the middle of five children, young John would not be able to continue his education: His family couldn't afford the secondary (high school) school student fee. Such fees, which range from $100 to $300 a year in many African countries, pose a huge barrier to school attendance for children in countries where the average wage may be $2 or less per day.\n\n\"Here was this kid who just happened to be born in another part of the world, who had the same dreams as any young person here in the US would have,\" Severson recalls. \"But by circumstance he was not going to be able to fulfill his dreams.\"\n\nSeverson paid the boy's school fee himself. And he didn't stop there.\n\nIn 2010, while a student at Brown University in Providence, R.I., Severson joined with a friend and his father, Dennis, to design a website that would allow others to provide financial assistance to worthy students. Severson became founder and president of The School Fund.\n\nOn the site potential donors can read about students around the world and \"find a student whose story you really relate to, and through our website fund their education,\" he says. Gifts can be as modest as just a few dollars or as generous as the donor wishes.\n\nSo far, The School Fund has helped more than 860 young people continue their education, some 500 within the last year alone. The effort is growing by 50 percent each year so the goal for the coming year is to fund 750 students, Severson says.\n\nThe \"crowdsourcing\" of charitable activities online has become hugely popular, including sites such as Kiva, which makes microloans to small business owners, and Donors Choose, where visitors can respond to requests from teachers to supply classroom needs. Kiva and Donors Choose \"have stirred up the pot and gotten this huge new audience engaged with these issues,\" Severson says. \"Everyday people [are getting involved].... I think it just builds a more caring, more connected, more sympathetic global community, and I think that's really important and really valuable.\"\n\nStudent profiles at The School Fund contain three things Severson believes are important to donors: transparency, communication, and documentation. Donors learn about the specific student they will be helping; if they wish, they can communicate directly with the student via the website; and they are shown documentation that backs up how their donation has been used, including, where possible collecting receipts. One hundred percent of donations go directly to the students.\n\nThe problem The School Fund is addressing is a huge one: In 2010, 71 million youths (generally aged 12-15 years) were not in school around the world, according to the 2012 United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report.\n\nSeverson acknowledges that helping a few hundred is a modest start. But for him it's all about those one-to-one contacts between donors and students. \"If we had just helped one student, I would have considered us to have a positive impact,\" he says.\n\nToday Severson works in a high-powered job on the new business development team at Google.\n\n\"I've done some exciting work on the self-driving car, [and I'm] working a little bit on Project Loon,\" which is exploring the use of a network of high-altitude balloons to connect people in rural and remote areas to the Internet, he says.\n\nHe enjoys balancing his challenging career with the rewards of running The School Fund. But now that the nonprofit fund has grown larger he has brought on a CEO to run it. Drika Weller has years of experience working with children in need at the United States Agency for International Development, the US government agency that delivers civilian foreign aid. \"She's doing a fantastic job,\" he says.\n\nThe School Fund has also gotten a big lift lately from Jack and Finn Harries, two 21-year-old brothers who run the youth-oriented Jack's Gap YouTube channel with 3.5 million subscribers around the world. The brothers have published an extensive blog post on the fund and plan to add a video soon.\n\nThey join President Bill Clinton's Clinton Global Initiative and entrepreneur Kathy Ireland among those endorsing the fund.\n\nSeverson has words of encouragement for others who want to start a charity.\n\n\"I tell people I've learned more through growing The School Fund than I have from any other single thing in my life,\" he says. \"It's an incredibly educational and rewarding thing for me personally.\"", "9 CONNECT 14 TWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft added a new building block to its plans for growth with the addition of the video game Minecraft and its studio, Mojang, for $2.5 billion.\n\nIf you've never heard of Minecraft, here's five questions about the game.\n\n1. What is Minecraft?\n\nIt's an open world, \"sandbox\" style video game, which basically means players are dropped into the game and can explore however they want. Players find resources, create gear and construct objects using 3-D cubes. It's the digital equivalent to Legos.\n\nUSATODAY\n\nMicrosoft to acquire Minecraft maker Mojang for $2.5B\n\n2. How did Minecraft get so big?\n\nIt started in 2009, when Markus \"Notch\" Persson launched a developmental version of the game for PC players. Despite graphics resembling much older games, Minecraft's game play is incredibly modern. The game generated lots of buzz among PC players, prompting an official release in 2011. It later expanded to video game consoles including PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well as Apple's iOS devices and Google's Android platform.\n\n3. How popular is Minecraft?\n\nIt's been downloaded more than 100 million times, according to Microsoft. It's the second most-popular paid app on iOS and the most popular paid app on Android. Keep in mind the mobile versions of both games launched nearly three years ago. The game has spawned its own merchandising, from apparel to Lego sets. There's even a movie in the works.\n\n4. Why is it so popular?\n\nFreedom. Players make the experience of their choosing, stretching their creativity. It can be an adventure game with villains to vanquish, or a construction experience where players can build anything from a simple home for their character to WesterosCraft, an accurate depiction of the universe in Game of Thrones (Time has a great look at some of the best creations in Minecraft). As Forrester analyst James McQuivey notes, \"Minecraft is what it is because its users are free to make it whatever they want it to be.\"\n\n5. Why would Microsoft want it for $2.5 billion?\n\nIt's a big name, with an even bigger audience. It could also help attract a younger group of users to the company's Windows Phone platform, says FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. \"They need to do everything in their power to entice consumers to go to their devices.\"\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.\n\n9 CONNECT 14 TWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1tX1wjy", "127 CONNECT 93 TWEET 11 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nYahoo began complying with government directives to provide user data to the National Security Agency on May 12, 2008, four days after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review found it in contempt of court and threatened daily fines of $250,000 for non-compliance, according to U.S. government documents released Thursday.\n\nAmong the more than 1,500 pages made public by the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were legal briefs detailing Yahoo's reasoning for its challenge.\n\nFor seven months, the Internet company refuted the government's demands, arguing that handing over user information about non-U.S. citizens outside the U.S. was unconstitutional and violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nThe U.S. government maintained the importance of the data requests and argued that it had safeguards against invading the privacy of U.S. citizens. \"Each day that Yahoo does not comply with the directives, we are losing foreign intelligence information that may never be recovered,\" said then-director of national intelligence J. Michael McConnell in the May 9, 2008, motion that called for the $250,000 daily fines and an order of civil contempt.\n\nThe fact that Yahoo had challenged the government's data-gathering process became known last year, but the $250,000 fines and details about data requests were among the new revelations.\n\n\"It always helps to put a name on things and to add more concrete detail because ... so much is kept secret that it becomes very hard to have an informed public debate,\" said Alan Butler, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center. The government's authority to gather foreign intelligence on terrorist organizations and other foreign powers \"all sounds fine in abstract but,\" he says, \"has resulted in the disclosure and sharing of ... private communications of innocent individuals that should not have been collected in the first place.\"\n\nEven as it began to comply, Yahoo later in May asked for a reversal of the decision. In August, the review court issued a final ruling approving the U.S. government's collection of foreign intelligence data.\n\nThe collection of data from Yahoo and several other tech firms including Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft went on in secret until former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents to the London-based Guardian and The Washington Post.\n\n\"The released documents underscore how we had to fight every step of the way to challenge the U.S. Government's surveillance efforts,\" said Yahoo's general counsel Ron Bell, in a statement on Yahoo's Global Public Policy Tumblr page. \"We consider this an important win for transparency, and hope that these records help promote informed discussion about the relationship between privacy, due process, and intelligence gathering.\"\n\nIn its May 29, 2008, brief asking for a reversal of the decision, Yahoo said that since the government was asking for data from Yahoo locations in the U.S. that were used by U.S. citizens \"privacy intrusion will likely be experienced in the U.S. by a U.S. person.\"\n\nGovernment requests that identified targets by user names such as \"Johndoe212\" could easily be confused and if \"one character off could invade Johndoetwo12's privacy,\" the company said in its legal document. \"Without requiring the government to link the intended target with the User ID to be surveilled, there is a significant risk of violating the privacy of innocent users in the U.S.\"\n\nRequests for user data \"can identify an unlimited number of individual targets at any time over the period of one year ... and for each target an unlimited number of Yahoo! accounts to surveil,\" Yahoo said.\n\nAs the legal arguments went on, the law was changed to require that a court obtain a warrant or deem a U.S. citizen a foreign power or agent, or employee of a foreign power before he or she can be targeted.\n\nBut current targeting procedures of non-U.S. citizens located outside the country could still inadvertently sweep in U.S. citizens because of the nature of the Internet, Butler says. And the processing of gathered data could also result in privacy invasions of citizens, he says. EPIC has pushed for increased transparency from the secret courts.\n\nThe newly released documents raise some \"pretty substantial questions\" about how the intelligence courts are designed, Butler says, \"and whether that is really conducive to the kind of oversight and judicial review that is necessary to have a healthy constitutional system and a healthy legal system.\"\n\n127 CONNECT 93 TWEET 11 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1s00ZB3", "41 CONNECT 61 TWEET 33 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nFor those who struggle to track their workouts, spending some extra coin on a personal trainer might seem like the best bet for staying apprised of your progress.\n\nBut now Jabra is offering up a different type of personal trainer -- the Jabra Sport Pulse headphones.\n\nIn addition to tracking your heart rate and pumping your ears with Dolby-certified sound, these unique headphones offer audio coaching -- essentially a disembodied personal trainer who whispers directions into your ear and even chides you if you're not keeping up.\n\nREVIEWED\n\nSony Audio Announcements: Tiny Hi-Fi Walkman and More\n\nThe headphones connect to Jabra's Sport Life App to manage your music, track your workouts and training, and even run heart rate tests. There are a bunch of different workout types, including running, hiking, cycling and even skiing. And crucially, the voice training changes based on the goals you've set. The app will coach you on interval training, heart rate zone training and different targets that you set, like pace, distance, time or calorie burn.\n\nThe app even offers three different heart rate tests. The Orthostatic heart rate test can tell whether you're overtraining or stressed. The resting heart rate test is self-explanatory: The lower your resting heart rate the more fit you are. And the Rockport Test measures the amount of oxygen your body takes in at its peak athletic performance.\n\nTo prove the accuracy of its heart rate measurements, the company had Campbell University in North Carolina test its headphones against an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine. The University found that the headphones' readings had a 99.2% correlation with the machine's results.\n\nThere's another interesting feature: The app can create music playlists from YouTube videos it downloads and stores on your phone. Sounds neat, but there are some questionable copyright law implications. At the very least, I doubt Google will be happy about it.\n\nLike most earbuds these days, these headphones have a volume rocker, playback buttons, and a built-in mic for phone calls.\n\nThe Jabra Sport Pulse Wireless headphones will go on sale in the U.S. at the end of October for $199.99, and you can preorder them at Jabra's site.\n\n41 CONNECT 61 TWEET 33 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1s1RWj4", "A roundup of today's big stories in hyperlocal publishing, marketing, commerce, and technology\n\nKKR Banks on Bisignano Forging Apple Deal at First Data (Bloomberg)\n\nThis month, as Apple unveiled new iPhones featuring digital credit cards, First Data CEO Frank Bisignano's effort paid off: First Data will provide encryption technology for the transaction system, called Apple Pay, a deal that could attract new clients and help turn around a seven-year-old losing bet by KKR & Co.\n\nMacy's Expands Shopkick Beacons to Stores Across the Country (Street Fight)\n\nMacy's just made a big bet on beacons -- the proximity messaging technology widely hailed as a key ingredient in the future of retail.

She remarked that in 30 minutes, Apple did what no one else could in 10 years: \"move mobile payments from a nice-to-have to a must-have.\"\n\nIt's a common refrain among technology types. But the belief that Apple Pay will turn the payments industry on its head draws on a long-held assumption in the tech industry that the Internet (the virtual network where no one know you're a dog) and the physical marketplace (where the bartender already knows your name) live by the same rules. In fact, these two marketplaces operate under much different dynamics, which will eventually push Apple's efforts into a much different direction than most people think.\n\nApple Pay, two ways\n\nFirst, let's quickly review the way the system works. Apple Pay will allow iPhone users to pay participating partners using their existing iTunes account. Partners can integrate the software into an application, point-of-sale system or online checkout just as they do with PayPal or Amazon buttons. Then Apple plays intermediary, passing the data through notoriously complex components of the payment industry.\n\nBut the core technology of Apple Pay -- the system that allows it to encrypt payment information on a device and hook into the existing payment structures -- needs to be separated from the way in which the technology can be used. On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook laid out two potential scenarios for the system: one, a virtual payment -- the type of ecommerce transaction we've made for years -- and two, a proximity payment made between two nearby devices via near field communication (NFC).\n\nTo understand Apple Pay, it's important to look at the viability of each scenario within their respective markets.\n\nThe ecommerce market, where the virtual payments would be made, is still relatively young. Online, critical institutions such as payments remain not only inefficient -- but structurally incomplete. Despite the efforts by retailers and technology companies, the rate at which consumers abandon goods in their digital shopping carts has remained at or above 70% for years. These are legitimate problems that govern the growth of the marketplace as a whole.\n\nIn that sense, Apple Pay fits Apple's strategy of entering a market which has seen substantial investment but still has yet to capture the consumer's imagination. The idea of building a payments mechanism into the operating system is the type of innovation that's needed. That's why Apple Pay will likely have a meaningful impact on the way we buy goods online almost immediately.\n\nOffline payments are a different animal. The industry is dominated by a set of entrenched competitors, each of which plays a small role in the process of moving money from customer to provider. It's at once extraordinarily uncompetitive and remarkably efficient. Plus, the economics of the offline payment industry put the pricing pressure on the merchant, making changes in business models -- a frequent vehicle for disruption -- relatively inert for the consumer.\n\nFrom a consumer perspective, paying offline is not a problem. That's why nearly every major project focused on driving users to pay with their phone has failed. PayPal's project is still fledgling, Google's wallet struggles, and Square ditched its mobile payment app -- a project that was once considered the future of the company and offered a comparable, if not better experience than Apple Pay in-store.\n\nHowever, the projects that have focused on the merchant side of the equation -- namely, mobile credit card readers from Square, PayPal and others -- have taken off. What's more, they are actually driving consumer adoption. A study from Javelin Research found that the introduction of mobile credit card readers, which effectively expanded the total addressable market for credit cards, has coincided with a 10% decline in the amount of cash consumers spent in 2013 from a year earlier.\n\nA virtual industry building for a physical world\n\nThe variations here expose an often overlooked structural difference between physical and virtual markets. Online, the near perfect parity among sellers -- our ability to buy from Burma as easy as Boston -- means that success of a seller is often determined by their ability to rapidly respond to consumer preference. Subsequently, the consumer drives the market in an almost totalitarian manner.\n\nThat's a relatively new phenomenon. In physical markets, the constraints of proximity create a collage of independent microcosms in which sellers sell to certain consumers and consumers buy from certain sellers. That scarcity reduces competition and decreases the likelihood for a seller to invest in say, a new point-of-sale system or payment processing capabilities such as Apple Pay.\n\nGiven the explosion of the Internet over the past two decades, the technology industry tends to approach problems from a virtual mindset. They tend to overemphasize the role of the consumer in driving change in a market, and underappreciated the critical role that the sell-side plays in its evolution. For local technology, that has led to a lot of money poured into projects with little return.\n\nThis is not to say Apple Pay will fail. When the most powerful technology company in the world puts its weight behind something its hard to bet against it. For one, iPay, or more-so NFC, will decimate Square, PayPal Here, and the dongle card reader market. The company has eliminated the need to use a dongle, positioning the iPhone or Google Wallet in a perfect position to take over the very small business market where it got its start.\n\nBut Apple's success in local will not come from the proximity use case that Tim Cook showed off Tuesday. In local, its success will largely come from integration with Uber, Grubhub, and other booking and scheduling services where the transaction occurs virtually and redemption occurs locally.\n\nEventually, we will reach singularity, and the division between man and machine, physical and digital will be trivial. Until then, companies need to build for both worlds.", "Analyst company Juniper Research estimates that global smartphone shipments for 2014 will reach 1.2 billion units. That's a 19% increase compared to 2013 when global smartphone shipments were estimated at 985 million.\n\nThe growth in smartphone shipments comes primarily from emerging markets. There, the sub-$150 offerings are selling like hot cakes and this trend is expected to continue. Smartphones below the $75 mark are expected to bring further growth to the market.\n\nJR points out that Apple and Samsung are dominating the premium end of the market, which leaves other companies feel the pressure from local players with cheap alternatives. Most notably, Xiaomi is enjoying an enormous success in China, while Google is pushing its Android One initiative in India.\n\nThe company reckons the iPhone 6 Plus has the potential to \"change the dynamics\" of the phablet market and give the Galaxy Note 4 a run for its money. Surely, both will enjoy a solid first weeks of sales, but it's yet to be seen how users will adopt the grown-up Apple smartphone offerings.\n\nIt's interesting to note that according to the research, Apple and Samsung are currently responsible for 45% of the global smartphone shipments. That might change though as the analysts expect the average price of a smartphone to decline globally to $274 by 2019.", "Google's Android Silver program was first rumored by Android Police back in April as a \"premium sale and support\" experience for users. In human speak, this means Google wanted to make Nexus-like devices with more manufacturers rather than just its one yearly release. Now that plan may be on hold.\n\nThe Information's Amir Efrati says that internal changes within the company, specifically the departure of one of its chief architects Nikesh Arora who oversaw partnerships among carriers and manufacturers for Google, caused delays. However, Google's newly launched Android One program, which looks to create a baseline standard for global low-end smartphones, could also be more important to the company at the moment.\n\nThe Information also says Google doubted if the program would even be commercially successful, basically the ultimate death knell for any corporate venture. Carriers and manufacturers were also reportedly lukewarm on the prospect. In some ways, this idea kind of exists already with Google Play editions but this was a rumored effort for manufacturers to opt-in for stock Android at the beginning instead of their own skins. Also, carriers would have trained staff in stores selling Android Silver devices, helping specifically with setup and data transfer, and 24/7 customer assistance via Hangouts, according to Android Police. Maybe we got our hopes up. After all, Google never announced Android Silver in any official capacity. And for now, it's future is uncertain. [The Information]", "The other sides of the query interface, and the only other parts of a search engine that's visible to users, are the search engine results pages (SERPs). This is the collection of pages that are returned with search results after a user enters a search term or phrase and clicks the Search button. This is also where you ultimately want to end up; and the higher you are in the search results, the more traffic you can expect to generate from search. Specifically, your goal is to end up on the first page of results -- in the top 10 or 20 results that are returned for a given search term or phrase. Getting there can be a mystery, however. We'll decode the clues that lead you to that goal throughout the book, but right now you need to understand a bit about how users see SERPs.\n\nLet's start with an understanding of how users view SERPs. Pretend you're the searcher. You go to your favorite search engine -- we'll use Google for the purposes of illustration because that's everyone's favorite, isn't it? Type in the term you want to search for and click the Search button. What's the first thing you do when the page appears?\n\nMost people begin reading the titles and descriptions of the top results. That's where you hook searchers and entice them to click through the links provided to your web page. But here's the catch: You have to be ranked close enough to the top for searchers to see those results page titles and descriptions and then click through them, which usually means you need to be in the top 10 or 20 results, which translates into the first page or two of results. It's a tough spot to hit.\n\nThere is no magic bullet or formula that will garner you those rankings every time. Instead, it takes hard work and consistent effort to push your site as high as possible in SERPs. At the risk of sounding repetitive, that's the information you'll find moving forward. There's a lot of it, though, and to truly understand how to land good placement in SERPs, you really need to understand how search engines work. There is much more to them than what users see.", "In the second part of Charlie Rose's interview with Tim Cook, Apple's CEO focused on the company's stance on user privacy, with the exec saying that for Apple, the buyer isn't the product.

If the government laid a subpoena to get iMessages, we can't provide it. It's encrypted and we don't have a key,\" the exec said.\n\nAs for backdoors in iOS that agencies can use to retrieve data from devices, Cook strongly dismissed such reports. \"They would have to cart us out in a box before we would [allow backdoors in our servers],\" the CEO said.\n\nTo further prove that governmental agencies have little to gain from Apple's data, Cook said that during a six month period, Apple only had to release personal data for customers at the government's request for zero to 250 cases. \"That's the lowest number you can quote. Zero to 250,\" the exec explained.\n\nDespite Apple's efforts, various reports have revealed that governmental agencies have very advanced tech tools that can be used to collect data from mobile devices including iOS devices, whether Apple likes it or not. A recent report explained how hackers can use such forensic software tools to mine personal data from old backups - which is what may have happened in the celebrities' nudes scandal.\n\nA video section of the interview, on privacy and Apple Pay, follows below.", "A lot of us anticipated Motorola's launch of the new Moto X. Some may argue that it's not the most powerful smartphone in the market, or the best looking, but whomever says that has clearly not spent any time with its software. Motorola's Touchless Control app was among the most popular of all the services included, and now that it's called Moto Voice, there are some good news for legacy Motorola smartphones.\n\nMotorola has just launched Moto Voice for devices like the 2013 Moto X, in addition to the Droid Ultra, Droid MAXX, and Droid Mini. This is an interesting move from Motorola given that the new Moto X barely started preorders today, and we know that companies like Samsung leave their latest software exclusive to new phones.

You've been skimping all week on sleep to keep up with tight deadlines at work, household chores and that old thing called a social life. You know you've got another late night ahead of you, so you head off to the office quiet room for a few minutes of shuteye.\n\nThe average American works more than nine hours every day, plus an additional four hours of work from home during the week, according to the National Sleep Foundation. In its 2008 Sleep in America Poll, the NSF found that 29 percent of these tired Americans have fallen asleep or at least became very sleepy at work.\n\n\"We're a sleep-deprived nation, a workforce full of walking zombies, because we're asking people to do the work of fewer people,\" says James Maas, Ph.D., former fellow, professor and chairman of psychology at Cornell University, who coined the term \"power nap\" in his 1998 book Power Sleep. \"If we operated a machine like we operate the body, we'd be accused of reckless endangerment.\"\n\nNow imagine a world in which napping on the job wouldn't only be a thing of sleep-deprived daydreams. While more and more bosses are coming around to the idea of some afternoon shuteye, it's still not exactly widespread, says Lawrence Epstein, M.D., chief medical offer of Sleep HealthCenters and co-author of The Harvard Medical School's Guide to a Good Night's Sleep. Instead, \"the misguided opinion that [sleepiness] is a sign of laziness rather than a physiologic reaction\" persists, says Epstein.\n\nThat could be changing. The NSF estimates that sleepy employees rack up billions of dollars in costs due to lost productivity and sick days, making it in companies' own benefits to provide us all with a few extra minutes during the day to recharge.\n\nSome progressive organizations others like Zappos, Google and Nike have created facilities on campus for employees to use when they need to get some rest, complete with beds, couches, soothing music and other sleep-inducing accessories. Others offer encouraging discounts for services at sleep \"spas\" like New York City's YeloSpa, which offers private rooms for rent for the purpose of 20- to 40-minute naps.\n\nFull disclosure: Here at The Huffington Post we have two nap rooms of our own, affectionately dubbed Napquest I and Napquest II. But we also don't want to mess with our nighttime sleep (oh, and we've got a website to run), so we asked the experts how to do the daytime nap right. Click through the slideshow below for their best tips.\n\nBut first, one very important thing to keep in mind: If you think your employer will not tolerate napping, don't risk it. We're not trying to get you in trouble, we're trying to guide those of you with the opportunity to efficient and rejuvenating sleep.", "If as a CIO you're expecting to get the same after-sales experience from a cloud provider as you have long enjoyed from your traditional supplier base, best reset your expectations.\n\nThat's a message I'm hearing on repeat when discussing cloud services with early adopters.\n\nWe have much to learn from those large companies that have opted to wear the risk as the first genuine enterprise customers of a new generation of cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services or Google Apps.\n\nI won't name names. But you've seen their chief executives bravely taking the stage at global summits, applauded for their forward-thinking and bravery. Their CIOs are showcased in colourful promotional case studies as the one big fat account that proves cloud is now enterprise-ready.\n\nBut six and twelve months on from these early flirtations, I'm hearing mixed messages from executives about the reality of the marriage.\n\nTheir problems are rarely about the technology, and whether it delivered the expected value. It's more often about love. Where is the love?\n\nBeing the first of the big boys in the cloud can, despite the wealth of users on the same platform, feel a little lonely at times. There are no enterprise peers in the US or UK to call up and ask what they learned from their implementation. It's more likely they'll be calling you asking the same questions.\n\nAnd it isn't easy to discuss contractual issues or risk issues in a user group - unless your version of a user group is an online forum inhabitated by software developers, many of them working within SMEs or service providers, and none with the issues of your scale.\n\nLike any marriage, the real challenge begins when something goes wrong.\n\nThere is an entire generation of chief information officers that have been fattened, boozed up and fawned over on the bill of vendor account execs and marketers. I've occasionally been there to enjoy some of it for myself. Lunch here, dinner there, business class airfares, whatever it takes for the salesman to get the deal.\n\nWhile we've (hopefully) moved on from the coke and hookers era that bound executives to one \"strategic applications partner\" (remember those good times in Vegas, mate?), the love is still there if your spend is big enough.\n\nThat's because vendors like Fujitsu, HP, IBM and Microsoft are sales and service organisations at heart. They might hire a few too many lawyers for our liking, but they sure as hell know how to make a buyer feel good about signing on the dotted line.\n\nYou tend to feel the love most with these guys when contracts are 12 months out from being renegotiated. You tend to feel the love when they need you to advocate for them at an event or in newsprint, or when something goes horribly wrong.\n\nAnd you're certain to get loved up good and proper when all of these coincide, as the oft-quoted story about HP CEO Meg Whitman flying to Australia to appease the Commonwealth Bank over an outage serves illustrates.\n\nSo what happens when something goes wrong at Google or Apple or Amazon, and you're their largest enterprise client in the region? Does Larry Page or Tim Cook or Jeff Bezos take a long-haul flight and promise to make amends in front of you and your executive peers?\n\nThey will most likely not even take your call.\n\nEarly adopters of cloud tell me that during pressing issues, like outages, they have been referred to a blog post for the 'official statement' - the same blog statement available to me as a journalist or any other member of the public. They've been asked to lodge tickets on a hosted service desk and wait in line for a response like anyone else.\n\nYou won't get a guarantee, or a documented promise that your service provider will make amends, to slap on the table at the next board meeting. \"This'll never happen again, folks, the lawyers have made sure of it.\"\n\nIn the cloud, there is no VIP club, especially once the deal is done. If cloud services do indeed cost less (they sometimes don't), it's partly because there are less humans employed to pick up the phone for you to vent at.\n\nYour cloud provider might not see the urgency in cutting off access to a departed staff member. That's your job now. And every customer is likely to be offered the same public access into the roadmap of new features - your scale won't necessarily buy you earlier insights.\n\nThat's ok right? This is the great democratising power of the cloud. As a CIO, you'll just need to accept that you won't get gold-plated service. So best not anticipate it.\n\nOn that basis, I reckon that using cloud adoption as an excuse to cut headcount in technical staff is a short-sighted idea. The mix of skills you require under a cloud model might vary - in that you'll need more skills higher up the stack rather than at infrastructure level. But that aside, you'll need somebody dependable to turn to - somebody to build a fix when your cloud provider doesn't have one.", "More shots have been fired. Fresh from going after Apple with new videos that attack the products it launched last week -- and even the bumpy coverage of its livestream broadcast -- Samsung is now focusing on the fact that it launched a bigger smartphone first.\n\nIn the video below, the Korean company digs into media reports which ridiculed the Note for being too big, and highlights those who suggest that Apple's iPhone 6 Plus \"imitates\" the Note.\n\nWe doubt Apple will return fire directly.

Doing so will put our country more at risk than it needs to be, while encouraging those countries to sit back and let the West do the heavy lifting.\n\nThis Prime Minister has shown, on numerous domestic occasions, an unseemly eagerness to surround himself with uniforms and rely on military personnel to lend their credibility to tricky policy problems. Now, he is clearly itching to be a wartime Prime Minister.\n\nThe Islamic State threat is too weighty a matter to allow what appears to be a somewhat adolescent fixation to replace long-term strategic thinking. We need a grown-up on the job.\n\nIllustration: Cathy Wilcox\n\nChris McGregor Cabarita\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul McGeough is correct: why rush to war. The Arab nations are standing by, watching. Prime Minister Abbott refers to the role of the Australian special forces to act as military advisers. The SAS has recently completed campaigns in two exhausting wars and one has to question if its soldiers are in the right mental state to undertake the task at hand. Let's hope their role remains as outlined because there has to be a question mark over the SAS's ability to operate at optimal capacity.\n\nStewart Manson Greystanes\n\nA hundred years of Western interference has allowed the Islamic State, al-Nusra and groups like them to become threats to our world. More recently, the US with the assistance of Australia destabilised Iraq, creating opportunities for extremists to flourish. The last 11 years of meddling has seen a 500,000 deaths in Iraq alone.\n\nSurrounding nations such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Iran either continue to sit on their hands or quietly fund these extremists. Islam needs to solve this turmoil. This was never our war.\n\nBruce Spence Balmain\n\nRobert Gates, former US Secretary of Defence, said the \"Saudis will fight Iran to the last American\". Maybe the Middle East powers will now fight the Islamic State to the last American.\n\nJon Barber Surry Hills\n\nAny strategy to combat the Islamic State must take account of the fact that its members believe they are doing God's will just as the Holy Inquisition and the English Protestants who burnt heretics at the stake believed they were serving God (\"Mission won't inflame threats here: Morrison\", September 15). History is full of people who committed atrocities in what they saw as a righteous cause for which they were willing to die.\n\nMilitary action in Iraq may be necessary first aid but it will not cure the disease. Instead of leading the charge of the Light Brigade against evil, Tony Abbott should concentrate on supporting Australia's Grand Mufti and other Muslim leaders who understand that it is all about ideology and therefore preach against the errors of these deviates. There are no simple answers to a very complex situation.\n\nCavan Hogue Umina Beach\n\nI am sick of wars we can't win and the problems they don't solve.\n\nDenis Goodwin Dee Why\n\nFull marks to Christine Milne for seeing through the Abbott government's mindless jingoism. OK, the Islamic State is brutality incarnate. But did we intervene in Cambodia to put an end to the Pol Pot regime? Did we intervene in Rwanda in 1994 when hundreds of thousands of Tutsis - men, women and children - were mutilated and massacred? Did we intervene in the Sudan to prevent the mass slaughter and rape in Darfur? No, no and no. So why do we have to risk young Australian lives yet again in Iraq?\n\nAnd how can we afford it? We have a budget crisis; we have to charge struggling families $7 for each visit to the doctor; we can't even afford to support young people looking for a job; we've had to slash our spending on vital scientific research.\n\nBut history tells us that incompetent governments like nothing better than a foreign adventure to distract attention from their domestic failures.\n\nDavid Oakenfull Asquith\n\nChristine Milne and the Greens will not stand up and fight an organisation that gruesomely murders innocent aid workers. What would the Greens fight for?\n\nMichael Bremner Alexandria\n\nI understood the sole spokesperson for the Greens was Sarah Hansen-Young. In Monday's Herald there was comment on government policy from a Christine Milne. Who is Christine Milne?\n\nBill Carpenter Bowral\n\nTime for Premier to stop Manly Council's car park plan\n\nIs it any surprise that Manly Council's ratepayers are up in arms about council's head-long rush to build an expensive, unnecessary and icon-destroying car park under Manly's beautiful \"village green\" oval (\"Manly residents in uproar over car park plans\", September 15)? I have been a Manly resident since 1990. Like David Begg, whose lobbying firm has donated large sums to the Liberal Party, I have a lengthy connection with the party, state and federal. But unlike Mr Begg, I, along with most other ratepayers, am convinced the plan has no merit.\n\nWe are concerned at the rumours swirling around this area as to why council would want to impose such debt on ratepayers while destroying the oval. Manly Council's insistence on the car park plan defies any rational analysis.\n\nLiberal supporters are aghast that their local member, now Premier, has failed to step in to stop the plan. His responses to constituents are bland cookie-cutter replies that are an insult to those who helped elect him. We have asked, to no avail, for the Premier to request his Liberal colleagues on council to stop this crazy journey into debt. The Premier and the Prime Minister (also our local member) have often said that debt is bad. I wholeheartedly support this view.\n\nThe time has long past when the Premier can tell residents that this is an issue for Manly Council to decide.\n\nDavid Taylor Manly\n\nA harbour hidden from sight\n\nThe renewed push to line the harbour with tall buildings is a selfish grab for views and the profit provided by those views (\"Going up in arms: anger over high-rises\", September 15). It is common courtesy when a crowd is viewing something beautiful for the tallest to stand at the back, to share the spectacle generously. If Urban Taskforce's views on this take hold, anyone two streets back from the harbour's edge won't even know it's there.\n\nDick Clarke Elanora Heights\n\nAt east Circular Quay we got The Toaster blocking the view to the Opera House and Botanic Gardens. At Barangaroo we're getting Packer's Pecker: a monument to greed and exploitation of the weak. Do we really expect western harbour to be any different? It's all about money, profits and power.\n\nGraham Link Leura\n\nSo Chris Johnson, former NSW government architect, where is it written that cities have to have \"robust tall developments\"? Is that something learnt during the course of your architecture degree or straight out of the Harry Triguboff textbook for development?\n\nBob Colman Blackheath\n\nBeleaguered ball game\n\nIf the NRL isn't worried about its dwindling crowd attendances, it should be. The Souths v Manly game at Allianz Stadium attracted 25,733 fans, but the Swans game against Freemantle in the same city attracted 10,265 more. The last four NRL games have had an average crowd of 23,883, which is less than half the AFL's average of 59,369.\n\nIn 2011 the first round of the NRL's finals attracted 123,121 fans - some 27,589 more than the corresponding round last weekend. The NRL's standard response is that its television ratings are impressive, but surely backsides on seats at grounds mean more.\n\nPoor refereeing, long, boring video refereeing delays, inconsistent application of rules that are increasingly harder to understand, and escalating costs at grounds are ruining rugby league.\n\nPaul Miles Gorokan\n\nNot beyond doubt\n\nOn the contrary, Gerald Borthwick (Letters, September 15), Judge Maspia has confirmed that she has the courage of her convictions - to decide without fear or favour. The state did not satisfy her of the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That is the relevant standard of proof.\n\nEdward Loong Milsons Point\n\nWrong century, Shorten\n\nBill Shorten has skilfully demonstrated how to go from being a mere national embarrassment to an international embarrassment in just a few days (\"Another poor mark on Shorten's report card - for ratbaggery\", September 15). Not only does he want to build low-quality submarines in Australia at a higher cost to taxpayers just so he can protect his union crony support base, he also seems to think we are still at war with Japan.\n\nWith a performance like this, Bill Shorten makes Jacqui Lambie look like Paul Keating.\n\nDylan Walters Randwick\n\nI am left stunned by Paul Sheehan's statement that the Labor Party has had a weakness for ratbaggery from its leaders. What did Tony Abbott deliver when in Opposition but unadulterated ratbaggery?\n\nWriting about the acquisition of submarines from either Japan or South Australia, not once did Sheehan mention the need to take into account social capital, something consistently overlooked by the right in this country. Top marks to Sheehan for his tunnel vision.\n\nCaroline Goosen Lapstone\n\nI am as shocked as Paul Sheehan by Bill Shorten's recent invocation of Japanese involvement in World War II. I suggest Shorten join the Japanese Prime Minister in his next visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, where he should abase himself thoroughly for Australia's role in aborting the Japanese East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nRichard Black Kings Cross\n\nLaw fails children\n\nYou are not alone, Briony Scott (\"Morally and legally, it's a principal's role to protect children\", September 15). Nor do I accept this standard. Nor does any fair-minded Australian citizen who shares your feelings of frustration when standards of common decency and compassion, let alone legal obligations, towards children in detention are so blatantly flouted and there is no recourse to justice. The solution may be as simple as the government applying equal fervour in protecting the human rights of a child as is applied to issues of border protection.\n\nJoy Nason Neutral Bay\n\nWater our art lovers\n\nIf the City of Sydney has $60,000 to lend for art, perhaps it could spend a little extra on installing and repairing drinking fountains to refresh the body as well as the soul (\"Art by instalments: loans on council table\", September 15) .\n\nWilliam Lloyd Denistone\n\nLaw without justice\n\nYour report that Joe Hockey believes Arthur Sinodinos is \"a person of great personal integrity\" raises the issue of the lack of personal responsibility taken by those in positions of power for failures on their watch, whether they be politicians, bankers, financial advisers or corporate leaders and the like (\"Joe Hockey says Arthur Sinodinos should return to cabinet\", September 15).\n\nWhile young black men are imprisoned in alarming numbers for relatively minor offences, older white men who adversely affect the lives of many and threaten our democratic processes face little or no consequences.

Since I've come to the Roosters, I've been really happy here.\"", "ANTHONY Watmough will make the painstaking decision on Tuesday morning whether to fight a dangerous throw charge -- and risk never playing for Manly again.\n\nThe NRL match review committee yesterday hit Watmough and Sea Eagles centre Jamie Lyon with grade one dangerous throw charges for their lifting tackle on South Sydney's Greg Inglis last Friday night.\n\nLyon can escape a ban with an early guilty plea but Watmough, with loading, faces a one-week suspension by pleading guilty, two games if he fights at loses at an NRL judiciary hearing on Tuesday night.\n\nThe possible loss of Watmough would further hurt a struggling Manly side already without injured forwards Glenn Stewart, Jamie Buhrer and Matt Ballin.\n\nManly coach Geoff Toovey and football manager Steve Gigg will meet with barrister Nick Ghabar on Tuesday to discuss the case.\n\nSea Eagles officials sent video footage of the Watmough incident, and other comparable tackles, to Ghabar on Monday.\n\nBy pleading guilty, Watmough would miss Saturday night's sudden-death semi-final against Canterbury at Allianz Stadium.\n\nManly will announce on Tuesday whether to fight the charge or accept the one-game ban.\n\nSpeculation continues that a disgruntled Watmough will be given an early release for next year to join Parramatta.\n\nMissing a semi-final with his team losing would be sad way for Watmough, a Manly legend, to exit Brookvale.\n\nIf he accepts an early plea, Watmough would at least be back for week three of the finals, should Manly progress past the Bulldogs.\n\n\"Damned if you do, damned if you don't,\" said one Manly source.\n\nWatmough has two premierships at Manly, ironically under coach Des Hasler, the Canterbury coach for Saturday night.\n\nManly five-eighth Kieran Foran avoided a charge after a high tackle on South Sydney's Isaac Luke.", "A LITTLE more than a month ago we marvelled at Manly's incredible durability. The Sea Eagles sat atop the competition table despite a series of distractions that would have left most clubs checking the cutlery draw to see if there was room for a wooden spoon.\n\nManly were post-apocalyptic cockroaches. Nothing could destroy them. As enthusiastic as their attempts at self-mutilation had been, not even themselves.\n\nYet on Friday night it took just 56 minutes for South Sydney to prove an asthmatic lung donor with a two-pack-a-day habit could blow down Manly's house of straw. Turned out we were naive to think the Sea Eagles were immune from the consequences of their inaction.\n\nBy the time the score reached 40-0 and even Charlie Crowe had tired of his dad's celebrations, the words of former Yankees' boss Abraham Lincoln rang true: A house divided against itself cannot stand.\n\nActually if Lincoln had worn his stovepipe coach's hat in the NRL he might have called Manly \"a house divided against itself that no one can stand''.\n\nBut let's put aside the schadenfreude other clubs are feeling about the Silvertails' sudden disintegration and pose the most compelling question of the weekend's semi-finals: can all Jason King's men somehow put Manly back together again?\n\nThe post-game signs were not good -- and not just because dwindling playing stocks were further reduced with Anthony Watmough facing suspension for a dangerous throw on Greg Inglis.\n\nFor the straw-clutching Manly faithful, Watmough's suspension might be considered a blessing given news of his three-year deal with Parramatta in the days before the semi-final proved to be the tipping point. The moment when mere \"internal dissent'' became internecine warfare.\n\nAs it stands Daly Cherry-Evans has more chance of being invited to George Clooney's wedding than Watmough's birthday party. So you might contend Watmough's possible absence will make the pre-game warm-up on Saturday more harmonious -- if he wasn't one of the best back-rowers in the game.\n\nThere seems no sign of compromise off the field. Usain Bolt couldn't have beaten a Manly director in the race to get to the media on Friday night to blame the club's disheartening defeat on someone else.\n\nManly is like a trip to Las Vegas. There are at least two versions of everything that takes place. Everyone claims they wanted to give Glenn Stewart a new contract yet, mysteriously, no one did. Everyone wants to heal the wounds, yet the club is riddled with gangrene.\n\nThis is one of those times when fans might be expected to \"rally behind the lads''. But given they don't bother programming Allianz Stadium into any GPS sold north of Neutral Bay, there is more chance a Sea Eagles fan will drive over a Manly director on Saturday evening than over the Spit Bridge.\n\nThe opposition? Expect no mercy from Des Hasler even in this peculiar game where the opposition coach will be on better terms with the players he is trying to beat than they are with each other.\n\nHasler was at his September best in Melbourne. The Storm for once showed up expecting things to happen. The Bulldogs made them happen. The squeamish bleated about Michael Ennis getting in Cam Smith's face. Hasler, you suspect, would have demanded it.\n\nIn that respect you doubt Hasler would be phased by the criticism of former Manly great Max Krilich who blamed the former coach for Manly's woes because of the backended contracts he left behind.\n\n\"That's the sort of bloke he is,'' Krilich told Fairfax. \"He doesn't care about anything but Des Hasler. Grant Mayer let Des run the club and now Toovs is paying for it.''\n\nHasler knows the Manly psyche -- at least the winning Manly psyche -- better than most because he helped perpetuate it throughout a wonderful playing and coaching career. He will be well aware Krilich was attempting to do what Manly used to do so well -- deflect and make the Sea Eagles the unlikely victim.\n\nGeoff Toovey will try to plant similar thoughts in his players' minds. He made a good start by blaming Inglis for dumping himself on his head.\n\nYes it's time for an old fashioned Manly siege. One in which they have an unusual advantage. The worst sieges often result in cannibalism. The Sea Eagles are used to eating their own.", "THE Wanderers could be forced to play a possible Asian Champions League final at the home ground of arch rivals Sydney FC, thanks to a scheduling headache at ANZ Stadium.\n\nIf Western Sydney defeat FC Seoul in their ACL semi-final, the club is almost certain to have to move the home leg of the final from Parramatta Stadium to a bigger venue, with ANZ thought to be the likely alternative.\n\nParramatta will definitely host the second leg of the semi-final on October 1, but AFC officials are likely to demand a ground with a bigger capacity be used for the final, should Western Sydney make it.\n\nThe Olympic stadium is hosting the Monster Jam event on October 18, in which giant trucks perform stunts and destroy obstacles on a specially constructed stage.\n\nThe infrastructure will take days to assemble and then dismantle, meaning the pitch will be without sunlight less than a week before the first leg of the ACL final.\n\nThe stadium is also hosting a T20 cricket international between Australia and South Africa on November 9, and has planned a turf relaying program to begin straight after the NRL grand final on October 5.\n\nHaving created a major upset by defeating champions Guangzhou Evergrande in the quarter-finals, Tony Popovic's squad is increasingly confident of success against FC Seoul, with the first leg on Wednesday night.\n\nThe victors will face either Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal over two legs.\n\nA Saturday night ACL final is likely to draw a substantial crowd, with Allianz able to host more than 45,000 people - more than twice Parramatta Stadium's capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, ticket sales for the Allianz derby between Sydney FC and Western Sydney in the second weekend of the A-League season has already sold as many tickets as both of this weekend's NRL preliminary finals at the same venue combined.\n\nThough Western Sydney supporters are likely to be up in arms at having to travel to Moore Park if their team reaches the ACL final, a precedent was set in 2012 when Allianz hosted the A-League grand final, even though it was technically Western Sydney's home game.\n\nIt comes as Popovic's squad flew out to Seoul on Monday, a journey that was a return for defender Brendan Hamill after his two years at Seongnam in the K-League.\n\n\"FC Seoul are a big club and I think they'll get close to a full stadium so the fans will be pretty loud and vocal,\" he said of the semi-final.\n\n\"The temperature is due to be around 25C so the playing conditions will be much better than they were in China in the last round.\n\n\"We have to be ready and on our game, to make sure we have a good first leg so we can take the tie alive back to Parramatta Stadium.\"", "AN old boys winds back the clock, Soward sizzles, Sea Eagles fizzle and Ennis is a menace.\n\nHighs, Lows and Big Blows covers all the major finals issues.\n\nHe is about to celebrate his 35th birthday next week but on Friday night, the South Sydney flyer proved that age is just a number. The former dual-international produced a vintage performance, scoring the try of the game with his Israel Folau-like leap over his opposite number Jorge Taufua who he terrorised all night.\n\nJamie Soward has claimed the mantle as the game's 'Mr Cool'. Lumped with the club captaincy by default following injuries to their two previous skippers, the Penrith playmaker produced when the game was on the line. With a tough kick from the sideline to equalise, Soward slotted the goal with ease. Then under pressure with the clock winding down, he clinched victory with a 31-metre field goal. Those who criticised Penrith signing their 'marquee' man to a four-year-deal have gone awfully quiet.\n\nJohnathan Thurston was again at his brilliant best wreaking havoc down the left edge in combination with Gavin Cooper. Cooper's stats make for devastating reading including four tackles busts, three linebreaks and 139 metres from 14 uses of the ball. Thurston was a 100 per cent with the boot also.\n\nThe pint-sized bunnies' playmaker shattered a 106-year record, following his 20-point haul on Friday to become the highest point scorer for any South Sydney player in a finals match. In his return from suspension for a dangerous throw charge in round 25, Reynolds laid on two tries, set up another two and potted six goals.\n\nIt has been dubbed the try assist of the year and if there isn't an award for a try assist - there should be. It was a freakish effort from the 19-year-old winger who somehow knocked the ball back from outside the field of play which allowed Dean Whare to score late in the game. Take a look at the video above, you will be glad you did!\n\nIn a beaten side Justin Hodges still delivered. Playing his new role of fullback, the veteran Test centre has been a revelation. With the Broncos' backs against the wall, Hodges single-handedly got his team back into the hunt. Despite playing a hand in two tries, breaking the line three times, busting five tackles and staying on the field after a nasty knock to the head, it wasn't enough to get the Broncos over the line.\n\nTim Lafai enjoyed an afternoon he'll never forget. Having announced the news that he and his partner Jacqui are expecting a baby after they were told previously they could not, Lafai celebrated the news with a hat-trick. The 23-year-old centre tormented Melbourne's right-edge defence all afternoon setting up Greg Eastwood for a try on top of his own flurry of four-pointers.\n\nSydney ... Hello Sydney? Come out, come out wherever you are!\n\nSydney hosted two blockbusters at Allianz Stadium on the weekend and the fans didn't want a bar of it.\n\nThe Panthers-Roosters thriller only managed to attract 23,000 fans, while the Manly-Rabbitohs attracted less than 26,000.\n\nWhat happened to the once bruising Manly defence? Trailing by 22 points, the game was all but over by halftime. The Sea Eagles looked like a shell of themselves, with their defence unable to counter a Rabbitohs onslaught.\n\nMichael Ennis is again living up to his reputation as a menace and master of the niggle.\n\nThe Bulldogs skipper has come under scrutiny after mockingly rubbing the head of Cameron Smith.\n\nChannel 9 commentator and former Storm player Brett Finch said the Australian captain should be shown more respect.\n\n\"I've got no problem with Michael Ennis ripping him or sledging (Smith) but touching him on the head. I think he should show a bit more respect to the Australian captain,\" Finch said during the broadcast.\n\nStorm Craig Bellamy agreed with Finch stating in the post-match press conference he thought Ennis' act was disrespectful.\n\n\"It's a lack of respect and you should be respecting your opposition,\" he said.\n\nRoosters coach Trent Robinson accused referees Jared Maxwell and Henry Perenara of being off the finals pace following his sides one point loss to Penrith.\n\nRobinson was critical of two incidents in particular - a decision to penalise Remi Casty for a double movement without sending the decision to the video referee and an incident involving playmaker James Maloney.\n\n\"Those two weren't ready for that tonight,\" he said after the match. \"They had that many stoppages and then Jimmy (Maloney) goes down and they don't stop the game. They missed opportunities. They were poor. Remi Casty's try was a try, as well.\"\n\nMelbourne have been a dominant force in the competition for the last decade\n\n\"I felt quite embarrassed about our performance in the first half,\" Bellamy said. \"...It's bloody embarrassing to be honest.\"\n\nSunday's loss acted as Ryan Hoffman's last game in the purple with the backrower leaving the club after 11 seasons to join the Warriors on a rich deal. Bellamy said one of the reasons he was so disappointed by their 24-point loss was because Hoffman \"didn't deserve to go out like that. \"He's been tremendous for the club. He's one of the best team players I've ever coached.\"\n\nThe video referee has killed the try of the finals. Following a sideline to sideline movement Josh Reynolds and Jesse Bromwich competed for the ball with the Storm in possession and playing on after the referee called six again. The end result saw Fijian flyer Sisa Waqa dance under the posts but when the footage was sent for review, the boys upstairs appeared to have found the tiniest of knock-ons. While the decision may have been right, it has again left the video review system under scrutiny.\n\nIn his third game of NRL, Manly hooker Jayden Hodges found himself taken to hospital after a collision with Greg Inglis early in the match resulted in a neck injury. With Matt Ballin and Jamie Buhrer injured, the Sea Eagles now have no hookers, leaving them in a bind ahead of Saturday's semi-final with the Bulldogs. Maybe coach Geoff Toovey will have no choice but to pull on the no.9 jersey and bark instructions on the field?\n\nThe biggest hit of Friday's game came from Sam Burgess - the only problem was it happened to be his teammate Kyle Turner who was knocked into next week.\n\nThis is the last thing Manly needed. Big guns Jamie Lyon and Anthony Watmough have been charged by the NRL match review committee for a dangerous tackle on Rabbitohs star Greg Inglis. Already without a hooker ahead of their must win match final with the Bulldogs on Saturday, Watmough will miss the clash with an early plea while Lyon would be free to play. Should Watmough fight the case and lose, he will miss two games.\n\nTariq Sims is facing five to seven weeks on the sideline following his shoulder charge on Justin Hodges. Hodges was left bloodied on the ground after the incident and refused to shake hands with the backrower at full-time. Hodges was heard yelling \"how many f***** grand finals have you won\" as he walked up the tunnel at the end of the game.\n\nThe Bulldogs' win came at a cost with second-rower Pat O'Hanlon leaving the field on a stretcher with a possible fractured leg.\n\nO'Hanlon's leg was bent in an awkward fashion during the second half of his side's 28-4 elimination final win.", "City's goal hero spent a large chunk of his career at the Allianz - and wants to extend his City career.\n\nFor Martin Demichelis' ponytail it was a case of hair today, gone tomorrow.\n\nBut the amiable Argentine defender is hoping his City career does not get the chop when his contract expires in the summer.\n\nDemichelis again proved his worth to the Blues with a powerful headed equaliser at Arsenal on Saturday - and then expressed the wish to sign up for at least another year.\n\nThe defender showed enormous strength of character, and plenty of ability, after a rocky start to his City career saw him dismissed as being past it, and his long hair was subject to ridicule.\n\nBut with skipper Vincent Kompany injured, Demichelis emerged as a rock in the City defence as they won the title.\n\nNot just that, he earned a recall to the Argentina squad for the World Cup, and then played his way into the team that ended up heartbroken in the final against Germany.\n\nGetting into the national squad also meant the end for his distinctive barnet, as he had vowed he would lop it off if he got the call-up.\n\nHe joked that, unlike Robbie Savage's ponytail that ended up in the National Football Museum, his had gone in the rubbish.\n\n\"But I have saved lots of money on shampoo, and maintaining that long hair, so I am happy I had it cut!\" he said with a smile.\n\nNow Demichelis is shaping up for a return to Bayern Munich, where he spent most of his career, in Wednesday's Champions League group opener.\n\nDespite landing a tough group that also includes CSKA Moscow and Roma, Demichelis says sights are set on the top two positions.\n\n\"The aim of this club is to improve year after year, and the next big step is to get out of the group stages and take it from there - and we have the quality to do it,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be extremely emotional for me because Bayern were the club that gave me the chance to come to Europe and play, and I was there for seven-and-a-half years.\n\n\"I am looking forward to going back to the stadium and playing against his old team-mates.\"\n\nDemichelis has been ever-present in the heart of City's defence this season, with new \u00a332m signing Eliaquim Mangala fighting to get up to full fitness.\n\nThe French youngster is seen ultimately as a replacement for Demichelis, whose two-year Blues contract is up next summer.\n\nBut the player, who turns 34 next month, feels he still has plenty to offer and hopes to get an extension for another 12 months at least.\n\n\"I am playing every game, every two to three days, so I am just enjoying it and taking it game by game,\" he said.\n\n\"I would be happy to stay this year and then one more year because I think I will still have the quality to play at this level.\n\n\"I would like to stay one more year because I think I can play at this level.\"\n\nHe underlined that with the vital equaliser at the Emirates to earn a point - the significance of his goal will only become evident over the next few days.\n\nAnother good result in Munich, and a win over Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday, would put a positive slant on City's season so far.\n\n\"It's difficult to assess at the moment whether it is a good point or a bad point - we will have to wait and see what happens against Chelsea. If we win that game, this will be a good point,\" he said.\n\n\"The collective responsibility of the team is to try to get all three points, but unfortunately that didn't happen.\n\n\"It was a challenging and emotional game, but we couldn't manage to get on top.\n\n\"We came back from 2-1 down and could have won the game, but unfortunately we didn't.\n\n\"It's difficult because I haven't watched the game, but from the pitch it looked like the referee was more in favour of Arsenal, so it was a bit frustrating.\"", "North Queensland coach Paul Green's inside knowledge of his former club the Sydney Roosters could be a crucial factor in Friday's NRL semi-final, his ex-premiership winning players say.\n\nUnder rookie head coach Trent Robinson, assistant Green was a vital ingredient in the Roosters' brains trust that took out the 2013 NRL title.\n\nThis time last year Green was plotting the Tricolours surge to their 13th title, now he is plotting their demise.\n\nAnd the world club champions' representative back-rower Boyd Cordner acknowledged on Monday, Green's insight could be a key factor in the Allianz Stadium clash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He knows our players, even though we have been doing some things differently this year,\" Cordner said.\n\n\"Greeny has got them going well at the right time of the season.\n\n\"It is a bit of an advantage, but we have a job to do Friday night, and if we can play some of our best footy the way we know we can, we will be pretty tough to beat.\n\n\"He is a very disciplined guy and he loves to win, it is no surprise to us to see the Cowboys going well.\n\n\"With the roster they have got, they are going to be really tough.\"\n\nRoosters halfback Mitchell Pearce added: \"Greeny has got them really hungry.\"\n\n\"With Greeny going there he has got them playing a similar style to us and it is all about who completes best and builds more pressure.\"\n\nCordner was readying for a battle against the Cowboys' intimidating forward pack that boasts Kangaroos props Matt Scott, James Tamou and in-form backrowers Jason Taumalolo and Gavin Cooper.\n\n\"The battle with the Cowboys will be massive, they have a couple of Test props and Matty Scott is playing some of his best football,\" he said.\n\n\"Also Jimmy (Tamou) has been awesome off the bench for them.\n\n\"But it is not just those two it is their whole forward pack, Jason Taumalolo and Gavin Cooper are playing some outstanding football.\n\n\"They are a really great team and a tough forward pack, and they have a pretty crafty No.7 so they are going to be really tough.\"", "North Queensland coach Paul Green's inside knowledge of his former club the Sydney Roosters could be a crucial factor in Friday's NRL semi-final, his ex-premiership winning players say.\n\nUnder rookie head coach Trent Robinson, assistant Green was a vital ingredient in the Roosters' brains trust that took out the 2013 NRL title.\n\nThis time last year Green was plotting the Tricolours surge to their 13th title, now he is plotting their demise.\n\nAnd the world club champions' representative back-rower Boyd Cordner acknowledged on Monday, Green's insight could be a key factor in the Allianz Stadium clash.\n\n\"He knows our players, even though we have been doing some things differently this year,\" Cordner said.\n\n\"Greeny has got them going well at the right time of the season.\n\n\"It is a bit of an advantage, but we have a job to do Friday night, and if we can play some of our best footy the way we know we can, we will be pretty tough to beat.\n\n\"He is a very disciplined guy and he loves to win, it is no surprise to us to see the Cowboys going well.\n\n\"With the roster they have got, they are going to be really tough.\"\n\nRoosters halfback Mitchell Pearce added: \"Greeny has got them really hungry.\"\n\n\"With Greeny going there he has got them playing a similar style to us and it is all about who completes best and builds more pressure.\"\n\nCordner was readying for a battle against the Cowboys' intimidating forward pack that boasts Kangaroos props Matt Scott, James Tamou and in-form backrowers Jason Taumalolo and Gavin Cooper.\n\n\"The battle with the Cowboys will be massive, they have a couple of Test props and Matty Scott is playing some of his best football,\" he said.\n\n\"Also Jimmy (Tamou) has been awesome off the bench for them.\n\n\"But it is not just those two it is their whole forward pack, Jason Taumalolo and Gavin Cooper are playing some outstanding football.\n\n\"They are a really great team and a tough forward pack, and they have a pretty crafty No.7 so they are going to be really tough.\"", "Motor insurers are still tricking customers out of extra cash by shoehorning them into costlier policies, burying fees and charges in small print and automatically adding unwanted extras.\n\nResearch by consumer group Fairer Finance found poor practice was still rife in the sector. A third of insurers still arrange pay-monthly policies for customers who have come from comparison websites when they have specifically asked to pay annually.\n\nFirms charge more when premiums are paid over 12 months rather than annually in a lump sum. Customers who do not carefully check that their selections have been retained are likely to end up paying significantly more for their cover.\n\nWorryingly, a number of insurers such as AA and Allianz are still automatically signing customers up for highly profitable \"add-on\" products that are not clearly disclosed or explained.\n\nAdd-ons are insurance products sold alongside the primary policy. Some motor insurers are believed to generate a third of their profits from add-ons alone.\n\nIn July, the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said add-ons offered poor value for money. It warned that customers were being overcharged by up to \u00a3200m a year for these options and said it planned to ban insurers from automatically selling add-ons.\n\nThe AA still opts customers into six months worth of free home emergency cover, which it then starts charging for on an annual basis.\n\nJames Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, said the AA appeared to deliberately set the policy up so it runs on a different time frame to the car insurance. Customers must remember to cancel the free cover before it converts to an annual policy.\n\n\"It runs out of sync with the car insurance policy so that they don't come up for renewal at the same time,\" he said. \"The AA also doesn't even tell customers at the point of purchase how much the home emergency cover will cost when the six months are up.\"\n\nAn AA spokesman said the insurer was in the process of removing the home emergency cover add-on. \"AA Home Emergency is a very good product that we think customers appreciate, but the AA is keen to be transparent,\" he said. \"In any case, home emergency cover, under the banner of AA Home Membership, is a popular choice for customers if it is offered on its merits without the free six-month automatic opt-in.\"\n\nAllianz automatically opts customers into windscreen cover, forcing those who don't want it to remove it manually.\n\nJon Lott of Allianz said: \"At the point of quote we do include windscreen cover as a standard as it is highly popular with our customers, and its cost is included in the price shown on aggregators [comparison sites]. However, it can easily be removed.\"\n\nThe research found that three quarters of insurers were failing to disclose their fees and charges properly - with most burying them in their small print. And more than a third of firms didn't include them in their policy document, instead pointing customers to supplementary paperwork.\n\nTo make matters worse, the average length of policy documents has gone up over the past six months from 18,000 words in March to around 18,400. Of the 44 car insurers in the market, Fairer Finance said only two used plain English in their policies.\n\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said policy documents were evidence of a legal contract and had to set out in full all details of the contract.\n\n\"That said, policy documents should be designed and written to make it as easy as possible for customers to understand the cover they have bought,\" he said. \"In many cases cover has widened in recent years and this may be reflected in the size of policy documents.\"\n\nMr Daley said most insurers could still do more to ensure customers understood the products they were buying.\n\n\"Fees and charges are often hidden away and policy documents are generally far too long for customers to realistically tackle,\" he said. \"In the long run, it's in insurers' interest to ensure that their clients understand what they're buying. But too many insurers find it too hard to resist the opportunity to try to make a quick extra buck.\"\n\nFairerFinance.com will publish its full rankings, based on customer happiness and trust along with how good companies are at handling complaints and how transparent they are, this week.\n\nTop 10 car insurers\n\nInsurer\n\nFairer Finance score\n\nCSIS\n\n99pc\n\nNationwide Building Society\n\n99pc\n\nNFU Mutual\n\n98pc\n\nLV=\n\n98pc\n\nJohn Lewis Insurance\n\n94pc\n\nSaga\n\n88pc\n\nAgeUK\n\n87pc\n\nSainsbury's Bank\n\n83pc\n\nAllianz\n\n73pc\n\nMORE TH>N\n\n62pc\n\nSource: Fairer Finance\n\nWorst 10 car insurers\n\nInsurer\n\nFairer Finance score\n\nAXA\n\n23pc\n\nPrivilege\n\n18pc\n\nHastings Direct\n\n18pc\n\nAA\n\n18pc\n\nDiamond\n\n18pc\n\nKwik-Fit Insurance\n\n15pc\n\nOne call\n\n12pc\n\nLloyds Bank\n\n12pc\n\nPost Office Ltd\n\n6pc\n\n1st Central\n\n6pc\n\nSource: Fairer Finance\n\n>>Don't miss: The tricks insurers and retailers use to sell poor value insurance\n\n* For money saving tips, tricks and ideas, sign up to our weekly newsletter by entering your email here\n\nFollow Telegraph Money on Facebook", "By: Tapan Singhel CEO & MD, BAJAJ ALLIANZ GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY\n\nOne of my obsessions is to know what the customer wants and how we can deliver the best results. Initially, our focus was to be the first among peers on delivery and keep pushing the benchmark. So, if the general trend in the industry was to settle claims in three months, we would do it in one. When others followed, we brought it down to a week, then three days and, finally, to one day. Then I happened to look at some statistics and figures, and realised that the industry, including us, was spending a lot of time and effort on incremental changes and wondered whether these moves really made a difference to the customer. I started meeting customers and the consensus was that while an early claim settlement was appreciated, the focus should be more on simplifying the claims process.\n\nDuring interactions, I also realised that customers can bring to your notice improvisations that you may have failed to observe, but placing a lot of emphasis only on what they want could also destroy a company's ability to innovate and be different. So, if you aim to redefine or transform your business to give the customer a 'wow' experience, you need to push boundaries and do the unexpected. I always tell my team that for us we have to think about 'relationships beyond insurance'. Now, that's what we do: strike a fine balance between the two segments for a holistic approach to the growth of the company.\n\nFundamentally, a customer knows what he wants from the current scenario, but may not be aware of the possible innovations in this space. This is where we have to step in as professionals, as people who live by their brands and industry day in and day out. Nobody else can come up with better solutions and innovations to enhance the customer experience.\n\nWith our past innovations we have been able to achieve customer satisfaction beyond expectations. However, we don't believe in basking in the glory of our past laurels. We don't think of innovation as a race, we believe it is a journey. Today, an innovation hardly lasts seven to eight months and is quickly replaced by another.

He chats and mingles with the fans before we head to the corporate box.\n\nIt wouldn't be a rugby league night out without the politics.\n\nWe walk in and find the Manly directors -- three on one side of the room and the other three, who don't talk to them, on the other.\n\nThese guys are as dysfunctional as their footy team.\n\nI tell Smith how much money part-owner Rick Penn is worth and that he owns a three-bedroom apartment on The World cruise ship, next door to Gina Rinehart.\n\nWe bump into commission chairman John Grant and his lovely wife Helen. The Glebe prestige car dealer Christian Saap, executive staff JimDoyle, Todd Greenberg and Paul Kind plus former stars Steve Menzies, Mario Fenech and Mick Crocker are among all the sponsors.\n\nLike McLachlan in Melbourne, I find out how well Smith knows his enemies from the rival football codes.\n\nBuzz: Can you name me three Sydney Swans players?\n\nSmith: Okay, um, Goodes. Adam Goodes and Buddy Franklin. That's as far as I can go. The Swans are the only team I've watched on TV. Rugby league is my sport. I haven't got a lot of time for anything else.\n\nBuzz: Okay, who coaches the Waratahs in the rugby?\n\nSmith: He's had a great year. What's his name. Um, um ... I know, Cheika. He's a very good coach, he's a bit controversial but he's done a good job.\n\nBuzz: You're on fire. How about an A-League question? How long have the Wanderers been in the competition?\n\nSmith: Not very long, can't say \u00adexactly, but they've done a fantastic job and I particularly like what they've done around membership.\n\nTV COVERAGE\n\nFor years your columnist has been campaigning for live Sunday \u00adafternoon football on Channel 9 instead of the dull, drawn-out and \u00adadvertisement-filled replays.\n\nMost fans already know the score and don't watch. It's one of the reasons television ratings have slumped so badly this year.\n\nSmith is all over it and wants to do something about it, even if it means tinkering with the five-year television contract.\n\n\"I agree with you: the more live free-to-air coverage we can get the better it is for the fans,\" he says.\n\n\"We will talk to the broadcasters. David Gyngell is a good bloke and very reasonable.\n\n\"Often when you talk about these things, your ambitions can align.\n\n\"You're 100 per cent right, though. Next year we've got to try to maybe start the Sunday game a bit later and show it live.\n\n\"We are going to talk to them and at the same time we need to make sure all our broadcast partners are okay with it. Ultimately, live sport is better than delayed sport.\"\n\nSmith wants the Wallabies and Waratahs star back playing rugby league.\n\n\"I think he's got rugby league in his soul,\" he says. \"Fingers crossed, he will come back to the game.\"\n\nThe NRL boss often bumps into Folau in the Moore Park area.\n\n\"Izzy and I have a chat every time I see him in the cafe here,\" he says.\n\n\"I always comment on how well he has played. He's a leaguey through and through and we'll do everything we can to create an environment where he might want to come back.\n\n\"He's a fantastic young man, a great rugby league player and I've seen him in the Origin sheds.\"\n\nTHE SUPERSTARS\n\nWe talk about how disappointing it is to be losing Sam Burgess and Sonny Bill Williams at the end of the season.\n\nLike Folau, Smith sounds determined to get both of them back.\n\n\"I hope so, they are both wonderful players,\" he says, \"They've both got great leadership qualities. Fans love them. They are young men with ambition and you can't fault anyone for having ambition.\n\n\"What I hope is that when they've done what they want to do, whether that's Olympics or World Cups, that they are going to come back to this great game.\n\n\"They both love rugby league and they'll be welcome back.\"\n\nSmith is sure doing well for a man who didn't know Cameron Smith was Australia's Test captain when he started in this job less than two years ago.\n\nMany of the highest-profile players in the game now have his mobile phone number and a direct line to the CEO.\n\nLast week Greg Inglis rang to get permission to bring a Starlight Foundation child to the Dally M awards. They got talking and now 10 children from the foundation will be attending.\n\nWe sat together for the entire game. He knew most of the players, the tactics and intricacies of the game.\n\nThere was only one slip up when Cheyse Blair scored for Manly in the corner and the referee went upstairs. Smith thought they were checking for a forward pass, not knowing they weren't allowed to.\n\nSYDNEY CLUBS\n\nI ask if he thinks nine traditional old teams can survive long term.\n\n\"Sydney is one of the most competitive sporting markets in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Nine teams have been there a long time.\n\n\"So far they've competed well but in the 21st century it's a different experience and we've got to make sure our clubs are sustainable and that they are doing the right thing by their fans. As long as they do that, yes, they can.\"\n\nSmith has been to all the suburban grounds. He loves them but at the same time wants to outgrow them.\n\n\"Shark Park, Leichhardt, Brookvale and Penrith -- I love all of them,\" he says. \"They are a fantastic experience but the truth is we don't want 16,000 people to watch a game -- we want 30,000 or 40,000.\n\n\"I believe if we get a decent stadium footprint, the right size for our crowds and the right entertainment and experience, we'll be able to recreate that atmosphere in better facilities.\n\n\"We want to do the suburban grounds experience on a bigger scale. The fans of tomorrow want a second screen, wi-fi and great facilities.\n\n\"They want to use their mobile phones and not wait three hours to get home to get their text messages.\"\n\nTHE BOSS\n\nIt's hard to believe the rumours and reports of Smith being difficult and hot-tempered inside NRL headquarters.\n\nI find him great company. A really decent bloke, relaxed, and anything but the toffy banker I first feared the game was getting.\n\nHis knowledge of rugby league has improved enormously.\n\n\"This year I'm loving it -- last year I was learning and I still am,\" he says.\n\n\"I'm now really clear in the direction the game should be taking.\"\n\nWe sit there and he really gets into it.\n\n\"C'mon Georgie,\" as one of the Burgess boys goes on a rampage, or, \"Oh Lote, what a magnificent try\" when the veteran winger leaps and scores in the corner.\n\nHe talks of his concern for injured Manly hooker Jayden Hodges at half-time and checks with his staff to ensure the youngster is okay.\n\nIn the end it was a disappointing game because it was so lopsided as the Rabbitohs raced to a 40-nil lead.\n\nStill, it was a great night out with a smart guy who has truly settled into his role.\n\nIt's remarkable that Jamie Soward got his chance at Penrith only because Todd Carney knocked them back. What a player. What a comeback. He's the buy-of-the-year by the length of a footy field. While he was carving up the Roosters on Saturday night, Carney was on the drink at Cronulla RSL.\n\nHIGHLIGHT II\n\nGetting to know more about NRL boss Dave Smith at the footy on Friday night. Good man, good operator and good plans.\n\nLOWLIGHT\n\nAll the empty light blue seats at the NRL semi-finals at Allianz. We had four Sydney clubs on show and the stadium should have been at near capacity on Friday and Saturday night.\n\nJUDICIARY TIGHTROPE\n\nThe NRL match-review committee is under enormous pressure this morning in dealing with the Anthony Watmough and Jared Waerea-Hargreaves tackles. Surely their actions were not serious enough to warrant suspension from sudden-death semi-finals.\n\nSTERLING EFFORT\n\nSouth Sydney halfback Adam Reynolds is starting to remind me of Peter Sterling in his heyday. His vision and game-management are absolutely first class. Surely he has edged ahead of Daly Cherry Evans as the back-up half-back to Cooper Cronk in the Four Nations.\n\nMANLY MAYHEM\n\nNo Glenn Stewart. No Anthony Watmough. No Jason King. No decent front-rowers. The Manly Sea Eagles appear to be facing a lean few years and a major rebuild.\n\n\u25a0 The NRL provided my ticket to the executive hirer's suite. I drank three of their Crown Lagers and ate six party pies. Parking was provided by the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust.", "A SHOCKING hit from Wests Tigers under-20's forward Tyler Cassel has the youngster facing a possible five weeks on the sideline.\n\nThe missile-like shot on fullback Devon Makoate-Boyce occurred in the 58th minute of the Tigers' 28-24 victory over South Sydney.\n\nAn early plea would see the Balmain junior miss four weeks however, should he unsuccessfully fight the charge he will miss five matches.\n\nMakoate-Boyce was not seriously injured.\n\nThe Tigers are set to play Brisbane in the semi-final at Allianz Stadium on Friday.", "AN old boys winds back the clock, Soward sizzles, Sea Eagles fizzle and Ennis is a menace.\n\nHighs, Lows and Big Blows covers all the major finals issues.\n\nHe is about to celebrate his 35th birthday next week but on Friday night, the South Sydney flyer proved that age is just a number. The former dual-international produced a vintage performance, scoring the try of the game with his Israel Folau-like leap over his opposite number Jorge Taufua who he terrorised all night.\n\nJamie Soward has claimed the mantle as the game's 'Mr Cool'. Lumped with the club captaincy by default following injuries to their two previous skippers, the Penrith playmaker produced when the game was on the line. With a tough kick from the sideline to equalise, Soward slotted the goal with ease. Then under pressure with the clock winding down, he clinched victory with a 31-metre field goal. Those who criticised Penrith signing their 'marquee' man to a four-year-deal have gone awfully quiet.\n\nJohnathan Thurston was again at his brilliant best wreaking havoc down the left edge in combination with Gavin Cooper. Cooper's stats make for devastating reading including four tackles busts, three linebreaks and 139 metres from 14 uses of the ball. Thurston was a 100 per cent with the boot also.\n\nThe pint-sized bunnies' playmaker shattered a 106-year record, following his 20-point haul on Friday to become the highest point scorer for any South Sydney player in a finals match. In his return from suspension for a dangerous throw charge in round 25, Reynolds laid on two tries, set up another two and potted six goals.\n\nIt has been dubbed the try assist of the year and if there isn't an award for a try assist - there should be. It was a freakish effort from the 19-year-old winger who somehow knocked the ball back from outside the field of play which allowed Dean Whare to score late in the game. Take a look at the video above, you will be glad you did!\n\nIn a beaten side Justin Hodges still delivered. Playing his new role of fullback, the veteran Test centre has been a revelation. With the Broncos' backs against the wall, Hodges single-handedly got his team back into the hunt. Despite playing a hand in two tries, breaking the line three times, busting five tackles and staying on the field after a nasty knock to the head, it wasn't enough to get the Broncos over the line.\n\nTim Lafai enjoyed an afternoon he'll never forget. Having announced the news that he and his partner Jacqui are expecting a baby after they were told previously they could not, Lafai celebrated the news with a hat-trick. The 23-year-old centre tormented Melbourne's right-edge defence all afternoon setting up Greg Eastwood for a try on top of his own flurry of four-pointers.\n\nSydney ... Hello Sydney? Come out, come out wherever you are!\n\nSydney hosted two blockbusters at Allianz Stadium on the weekend and the fans didn't want a bar of it.\n\nThe Panthers-Roosters thriller only managed to attract 23,000 fans, while the Manly-Rabbitohs attracted less than 26,000.\n\nWhat happened to the once bruising Manly defence? Trailing by 22 points, the game was all but over by halftime. The Sea Eagles looked like a shell of themselves, with their defence unable to counter a Rabbitohs onslaught.\n\nMichael Ennis is again living up to his reputation as a menace and master of the niggle.\n\nThe Bulldogs skipper has come under scrutiny after mockingly rubbing the head of Cameron Smith.\n\nChannel 9 commentator and former Storm player Brett Finch said the Australian captain should be shown more respect.\n\n\"I've got no problem with Michael Ennis ripping him or sledging (Smith) but touching him on the head. I think he should show a bit more respect to the Australian captain,\" Finch said during the broadcast.\n\nStorm Craig Bellamy agreed with Finch stating in the post-match press conference he thought Ennis' act was disrespectful.\n\n\"It's a lack of respect and you should be respecting your opposition,\" he said.\n\nRoosters coach Trent Robinson accused referees Jared Maxwell and Henry Perenara of being off the finals pace following his sides one point loss to Penrith.\n\nRobinson was critical of two incidents in particular - a decision to penalise Remi Casty for a double movement without sending the decision to the video referee and an incident involving playmaker James Maloney.\n\n\"Those two weren't ready for that tonight,\" he said after the match. \"They had that many stoppages and then Jimmy (Maloney) goes down and they don't stop the game. They missed opportunities. They were poor. Remi Casty's try was a try, as well.\"\n\nMelbourne have been a dominant force in the competition for the last decade\n\n\"I felt quite embarrassed about our performance in the first half,\" Bellamy said. \"...It's bloody embarrassing to be honest.\"\n\nSunday's loss acted as Ryan Hoffman's last game in the purple with the backrower leaving the club after 11 seasons to join the Warriors on a rich deal. Bellamy said one of the reasons he was so disappointed by their 24-point loss was because Hoffman \"didn't deserve to go out like that. \"He's been tremendous for the club. He's one of the best team players I've ever coached.\"\n\nThe video referee has killed the try of the finals. Following a sideline to sideline movement Josh Reynolds and Jesse Bromwich competed for the ball with the Storm in possession and playing on after the referee called six again. The end result saw Fijian flyer Sisa Waqa dance under the posts but when the footage was sent for review, the boys upstairs appeared to have found the tiniest of knock-ons. While the decision may have been right, it has again left the video review system under scrutiny.\n\nIn his third game of NRL, Manly hooker Jayden Hodges found himself taken to hospital after a collision with Greg Inglis early in the match resulted in a neck injury. With Matt Ballin and Jamie Buhrer injured, the Sea Eagles now have no hookers, leaving them in a bind ahead of Saturday's semi-final with the Bulldogs. Maybe coach Geoff Toovey will have no choice but to pull on the no.9 jersey and bark instructions on the field?\n\nThe biggest hit of Friday's game came from Sam Burgess - the only problem was it happened to be his teammate Kyle Turner who was knocked into next week.\n\nThis is the last thing Manly needed. Big guns Jamie Lyon and Anthony Watmough have been charged by the NRL match review committee for a dangerous tackle on Rabbitohs star Greg Inglis. Already without a hooker ahead of their must win match final with the Bulldogs on Saturday, Watmough will miss the clash with an early plea while Lyon would be free to play. Should Watmough fight the case and lose, he will miss two games.\n\nTariq Sims is facing five to seven weeks on the sideline following his shoulder charge on Justin Hodges. Hodges was left bloodied on the ground after the incident and refused to shake hands with the backrower at full-time. Hodges was heard yelling \"how many f***** grand finals have you won\" as he walked up the tunnel at the end of the game.\n\nThe Bulldogs' win came at a cost with second-rower Pat O'Hanlon leaving the field on a stretcher with a possible fractured leg.\n\nO'Hanlon's leg was bent in an awkward fashion during the second half of his side's 28-4 elimination final win.", "MELBOURNE City have added Erik Paartalu to its already burgeoning 2014-15 squad.\n\nPaartalu, a two-time A-League championship winner with Brisbane Roar, comes to City from Thai giants Muangthong United.\n\nThe 28-year-old defensive midfielder has signed a four-year deal under the salary cap.\n\nPaartalu, twice capped by the Socceroos, had also been courted by the Newcastle Jets.\n\nSince leaving the Roar in 2013 he has spent a season in China at Tianjin Teda and another at Muangthong.\n\n\"Only been here for 24 hours but I've got a great feeling for the City and the team,\" Paartalu said this morning.\n\n\"The training facilities are first class and I just can't wait to get started.\n\n\"This club is definitely headed in the right direction, obviously with Manchester City jumping on board it's a great club. I'm sure all the players are proud to be here and I'm no exception.\n\n\"It's certainly a team that's going to go from strength to strength and I want to be a part of it.\"\n\nAt City Paartalu links with former Roar teammates Massimo Murdocca and Andrew Redmayne as well as Iain Ramsay, who he played with in Scotland.\n\nPaartalu hasn't played since August, but now has until the Round 1 clash against Sydney FC at Allianz Stadium on October 11 to get himself match fit.\n\n\"I started playing in Thailand in January and played about 30 games up until about a month ago.\n\n\"I've definitely got the match fitness there, I just need to sharpen up.\n\n\"I've not trained for two and a half weeks with a team so I'm just getting around the boys and starting training today.\"\n\nCity coach John van 't Schip said Paartalu was a perfect fit for his side and would create even further competition for spots amongst his midfield.", "Shortage of over a million cyber security experts globally: CiscoIrda probes ICICI Lombard Insurance for alleged fraud in govt schemesChrysler, Nissan looking into claims their cars 'most hackable'A tangled web\n\nLast week, over 5 million email IDs and passwords of Gmail users were reported to have been hacked. With the rising threat of data breach emerging as a major risk area for companies, general insurance companies are offering cover against financial losses arising out of such data loss. In the last four months, about 35 companies have bought such insurance covers of up to Rs 300 crore.\n\nAt least three leading general insurers -- Tata AIG, ICICI Lombard and HDFC Ergo -- have already launched insurance schemes offering cover against cyber risk, and others like Bajaj Allianz and Reliance General Insurance are working on such a product in view of the rising demand. While the maximum cover provided so far is Rs 300 crore, insurers say they can increase it to Rs 600 crore depending on the requirement of the customer.\n\nWhen HDFC Ergo launched its standalone cyber security policy a couple of years ago, it found only a couple of customers in the first year. But in the last few months, it has seen a sharp rise in the demand for such schemes. Both Tata AIG and ICICI Lombard launched their policy this year. While insurers declined to share the names of companies that have taken the policies, they said most of the customers are BPOs and IT companies which handle third party data. The list also includes banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe policy does not come cheap. The annual premium for a Rs 10 crore cover is Rs 12-18 lakh, and Rs 2.4-3 crore for a Rs 300 crore cover, depending on whether the data belongs to customers in India or abroad.\n\n\"If the data loss involves Indian customers, the financial downside is less and hence it means a lower premium as compared to cases where the data involves customers in the US and UK. The law in the US and UK requires that in case of data breach, the company has to inform all the customers, which involves huge cost. In India, there is no such requirement and customers are only required to be compensated if they sue the company,\" said Sushant Sarin, head of liabilities, at Tata AIG General Insurance.\n\n\"The premiums are high because the risk is very high. It is not just the loss that the company suffers financially but its about data records... mostly BPOs and IT companies take the policy as they handle third party data,\"", "SYDNEY Roosters coach Trent Robinson would be breathing a big sigh of relief today after the NRL match review committee found prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves had no case to answer for a high tackle on Penrith's Brent Kite.\n\nThe panel decided not to sanction the Kiwis international after he was placed on report by referee Jared Maxwell in the ninth minute of Saturday night's one-point loss to Penrith 19-18 in their qualifying final.\n\nWaerea-Hargreaves is now free to play North Queensland in this Friday's elimination semi-final at Allianz Stadium. Conversely their opponents have been hit hard with Cowboys forward Tariq Sims offered a five-match ban for his shoulder charge on Brisbane fullback Justin Hodges.\n\nSims has been issued a grade three for the tackle, partly due to the fact it's his third offence in two years.\n\nAn unsuccessful challenge at the judiciary could see him spent seven weeks on the sidelines.\n\nEither way that appears to be last time the Newcastle-bound Sims plays in a North Queensland jumper.\n\nWaerea-Hargreaves being cleared will be welcome relief for the Roosters who have backrower Dylan Napa on the sidelines through suspension. The club is also uncertain of when outstanding hooker Jake Friend will be available again following bleeding on his lungs.\n\nIn other judiciary news, Manly's Test and Origin backrower Anthony Watmough will miss only one week for his dangerous throw on South Sydney fullback Greg Inglis in the other qualifying final last weekend.\n\nSea Eagles skipper Jamie Lyon was also charged over that tackle but will escape missing any matches if he pleads early.\n\nManly five-eighth Kieran Foran also escaped any attention from the match review committee for his high tackle on Souths hooker Issac Luke in the 49th minute.\n\nMelbourne's Billy Slater received good news as well with no charge from his knees into the back of Canterbury's Josh Reynolds at AAMI Park yesterday.\n\nIf Slater had been given time on the sidelines, it would have affected his availability for the Four Nations tournament in October-November.\n\nThe incumbent Australian fullback was named by coach Tim Sheens in the Kangaroos train-on squad today, alongside teammates Cooper Cronk, Ryan Hoffman, Cam Smith and Will Chambers, now that Storm has bowed out of the NRL finals race with the 28-4 loss to the Bulldogs.", "AN old boys winds back the clock, Soward sizzles, Sea Eagles fizzle and Ennis is a menace.\n\nHighs, Lows and Big Blows covers all the major finals issues.\n\nHe is about to celebrate his 35th birthday next week but on Friday night, the South Sydney flyer proved that age is just a number.

I don't want to whinge about it too much and hopefully he'll be right to play next week.''", "AN old boys winds back the clock, Soward sizzles, Sea Eagles fizzle and Ennis is a menace.\n\nHighs, Lows and Big Blows covers all the major finals issues.\n\nHe is about to celebrate his 35th birthday next week but on Friday night, the South Sydney flyer proved that age is just a number. The former dual-international produced a vintage performance, scoring the try of the game with his Israel Folau-like leap over his opposite number Jorge Taufua who he terrorised all night.\n\nJamie Soward has claimed the mantle as the game's 'Mr Cool'. Lumped with the club captaincy by default following injuries to their two previous skippers, the Penrith playmaker produced when the game was on the line. With a tough kick from the sideline to equalise, Soward slotted the goal with ease. Then under pressure with the clock winding down, he clinched victory with a 31-metre field goal. Those who criticised Penrith signing their 'marquee' man to a four-year-deal have gone awfully quiet.\n\nJohnathan Thurston was again at his brilliant best wreaking havoc down the left edge in combination with Gavin Cooper. Cooper's stats make for devastating reading including four tackles busts, three linebreaks and 139 metres from 14 uses of the ball. Thurston was a 100 per cent with the boot also.\n\nThe pint-sized bunnies' playmaker shattered a 106-year record, following his 20-point haul on Friday to become the highest point scorer for any South Sydney player in a finals match. In his return from suspension for a dangerous throw charge in round 25, Reynolds laid on two tries, set up another two and potted six goals.\n\nIt has been dubbed the try assist of the year and if there isn't an award for a try assist - there should be. It was a freakish effort from the 19-year-old winger who somehow knocked the ball back from outside the field of play which allowed Dean Whare to score late in the game. Take a look at the video above, you will be glad you did!\n\nIn a beaten side Justin Hodges still delivered. Playing his new role of fullback, the veteran Test centre has been a revelation. With the Broncos' backs against the wall, Hodges single-handedly got his team back into the hunt. Despite playing a hand in two tries, breaking the line three times, busting five tackles and staying on the field after a nasty knock to the head, it wasn't enough to get the Broncos over the line.\n\nTim Lafai enjoyed an afternoon he'll never forget. Having announced the news that he and his partner Jacqui are expecting a baby after they were told previously they could not, Lafai celebrated the news with a hat-trick. The 23-year-old centre tormented Melbourne's right-edge defence all afternoon setting up Greg Eastwood for a try on top of his own flurry of four-pointers.\n\nSydney ... Hello Sydney? Come out, come out wherever you are!\n\nSydney hosted two blockbusters at Allianz Stadium on the weekend and the fans didn't want a bar of it.\n\nThe Panthers-Roosters thriller only managed to attract 23,000 fans, while the Manly-Rabbitohs attracted less than 26,000.\n\nWhat happened to the once bruising Manly defence? Trailing by 22 points, the game was all but over by halftime. The Sea Eagles looked like a shell of themselves, with their defence unable to counter a Rabbitohs onslaught.\n\nMichael Ennis is again living up to his reputation as a menace and master of the niggle.\n\nThe Bulldogs skipper has come under scrutiny after mockingly rubbing the head of Cameron Smith.\n\nChannel 9 commentator and former Storm player Brett Finch said the Australian captain should be shown more respect.\n\n\"I've got no problem with Michael Ennis ripping him or sledging (Smith) but touching him on the head. I think he should show a bit more respect to the Australian captain,\" Finch said during the broadcast.\n\nStorm Craig Bellamy agreed with Finch stating in the post-match press conference he thought Ennis' act was disrespectful.\n\n\"It's a lack of respect and you should be respecting your opposition,\" he said.\n\nRoosters coach Trent Robinson accused referees Jared Maxwell and Henry Perenara of being off the finals pace following his sides one point loss to Penrith.\n\nRobinson was critical of two incidents in particular - a decision to penalise Remi Casty for a double movement without sending the decision to the video referee and an incident involving playmaker James Maloney.\n\n\"Those two weren't ready for that tonight,\" he said after the match. \"They had that many stoppages and then Jimmy (Maloney) goes down and they don't stop the game. They missed opportunities. They were poor. Remi Casty's try was a try, as well.\"\n\nMelbourne have been a dominant force in the competition for the last decade\n\n\"I felt quite embarrassed about our performance in the first half,\" Bellamy said. \"...It's bloody embarrassing to be honest.\"\n\nSunday's loss acted as Ryan Hoffman's last game in the purple with the backrower leaving the club after 11 seasons to join the Warriors on a rich deal. Bellamy said one of the reasons he was so disappointed by their 24-point loss was because Hoffman \"didn't deserve to go out like that. \"He's been tremendous for the club. He's one of the best team players I've ever coached.\"\n\nThe video referee has killed the try of the finals. Following a sideline to sideline movement Josh Reynolds and Jesse Bromwich competed for the ball with the Storm in possession and playing on after the referee called six again. The end result saw Fijian flyer Sisa Waqa dance under the posts but when the footage was sent for review, the boys upstairs appeared to have found the tiniest of knock-ons. While the decision may have been right, it has again left the video review system under scrutiny.\n\nIn his third game of NRL, Manly hooker Jayden Hodges found himself taken to hospital after a collision with Greg Inglis early in the match resulted in a neck injury. With Matt Ballin and Jamie Buhrer injured, the Sea Eagles now have no hookers, leaving them in a bind ahead of Saturday's semi-final with the Bulldogs. Maybe coach Geoff Toovey will have no choice but to pull on the no.9 jersey and bark instructions on the field?\n\nThe biggest hit of Friday's game came from Sam Burgess - the only problem was it happened to be his teammate Kyle Turner who was knocked into next week.\n\nThis is the last thing Manly needed. Big guns Jamie Lyon and Anthony Watmough have been charged by the NRL match review committee for a dangerous tackle on Rabbitohs star Greg Inglis. Already without a hooker ahead of their must win match final with the Bulldogs on Saturday, Watmough will miss the clash with an early plea while Lyon would be free to play. Should Watmough fight the case and lose, he will miss two games.\n\nTariq Sims is facing five to seven weeks on the sideline following his shoulder charge on Justin Hodges. Hodges was left bloodied on the ground after the incident and refused to shake hands with the backrower at full-time. Hodges was heard yelling \"how many f***** grand finals have you won\" as he walked up the tunnel at the end of the game.\n\nThe Bulldogs' win came at a cost with second-rower Pat O'Hanlon leaving the field on a stretcher with a possible fractured leg.\n\nO'Hanlon's leg was bent in an awkward fashion during the second half of his side's 28-4 elimination final win.", "Tyler Cassel of the Tigers collects Devon Makoate-Boyce of South Sydney in a high tackle during Friday night's qualifying final.\n\nJared Waerea-Hargreaves cleared\n\nWests Tigers forward Tyler Cassel could be banned for up to five weeks for a torpedo-like tackle into Devon Makoate-Boyce as the South Sydney player tried to kick the ball during Friday night's qualifying final in the Holden Cup at Allianz Stadium.\n\nCassel, 19, was hit with a grade four dangerous contact with kicker charge - not the more serious shoulder charge misdemeanour - for the late tackle where he collected Makoate-Boyce's chin with his shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe will be banned for five weeks if he fights the charge and loses, and four if he takes the early guilty plea.\n\nSouth Sydney duo Tevita Cottrell (one to two weeks) and Jack Gosiewski (will escape ban with early guilty plea) were charged following the Rabbitohs elimination loss to the Tigers.\n\nBrisbane's Jo Ofahengaue and Parramatta's Kelepi Tanginoa will escape bans after grade one careless high tackle charges.", "COWBOYS enforcer Tariq Sims may have played his last game for the season after being hit with a grade-three shoulder charge offence.\n\nSims faces a five-week ban if he pleads guilty and seven if he fights the case and loses.\n\nEarlier:\n\nTHE Cowboys are nervously waiting to see if Tariq Sims's silly shoulder charge will rule him out for their premiership tilt but believe their enforcer doesn't have a case to answer.\n\nThe Cowboys consider the hit that felled Justin Hodges was a head clash and Sims should be free to face the Sydney Roosters on Friday at Allianz Stadium.\n\nLosing Sims would be a crushing blow for the Cowboys after their impressive victory over Brisbane in week one of the finals.\n\nCowboys officials think the incident only warranted a penalty for being a late tackle and are adamant the only high contact was Sims' head collecting Hodges' head.\n\nBut Sydney Roosters great Brad Fittler was equally confident Sims would have to miss at least a week for a shoulder charge.\n\nFittler told Channel 9 that Sims was certain to be suspended. Even a grade one shoulder charge (200 points) would require Sims to spend two weeks on the sidelines.\n\nSims has 33 carry-over points and was suspended for a crusher tackle last month, which adds a 20 per cent weighting to any charge.\n\nEven with an early plea, his suspension would stand at two weeks, which would be a huge blow for the Cowboys' premiership hopes.\n\n\"We just have to wait and see.

For the second consecutive season, they've been drawn with German giants Bayern Munich, who won the tournament two seasons ago. On Wednesday, they play each other in their Champions League opener (FOX Sports 1, 2:45 p.m. ET).\n\nBayern reinforced their team this summer, most notably adding Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer from rivals Borussia Dortmund. They've also signed Juan Bernat, who's been their starting left back all season, and defender Mehdi Benatia, who's probably a week or two off from playing a significant part. Manchester City's big add was defensive midfielder Fernando, who's played more than Fernandinho thus far this year, while Eliaquim Mangala is waiting to make his debut. Bacary Sagna has been a backup thus far, but should get his chance to start Wednesday.\n\nWhile very little has changed in the way City play, Pep Guardiola has made sweeping changes at Bayern. Last season, he played a hybrid of his classic Barcelona style and the high-octane 4-2-3-1 that Jupp Heynckes used to guide the Bavarians to a treble. This season, he's completely revamped the system, playing an odd formation that switches between a back three and four in and out of possession.\n\nPep's side might look like a juggernaut once everyone's healthy and has had time to learn the system, but at the moment, they look a bit shaky. Can City take advantage of their growing pains and spring an upset at the Allianz Arena?\n\nThe Bayern Munich injury list is currently a mile long. Rafinha and Thiago Alcantara are both long-term absentees, while Holger Badstuber picked up a fresh injury over the weekend. Franck Ribery is sitting this one out for unspecified reasons, while new recruit Mehdi Benatia is yet to get fully fit.\n\nCity's injury list is quite a bit shorter. The only player out due to a fitness issue is Stevan Jovetic, while Pablo Zabaleta is suspended.\n\nHolger Badstuber's injury leaves Bayern Munich thin in defense once again. The formation here is mostly irrelevant, both because Bayern take different shapes with and without the ball and because they're extremely fluid. The important thing is Rode, or who plays in his place. If Rode or Gianluca Gaudino starts, it probably means Philipp Lahm is playing on the right. If Arjen Robben or Xherdan Shaqiri starts, Lahm is playing in the middle.\n\nCity's formation is less ambiguous, but there are just as many selection dilemmas. Manuel Pellegrini could opt to deviate from this projected lineup by going more defensive, finding spots for Fernandinho and James Milner over more attacking players, and moving Yaya Toure up the pitch.\n\nHow well do Bayern's players understand their roles? - Completely undefined roles and players who are learning to play with each other don't hurt Bayern against sides like Stuttgart. Even against better teams like Wolfsburg and Schalke, they've looked far superior. But against Manchester City, Bayern's defense will get torched if they don't understand their roles.\n\nAre City just playing for the draw? - We'll be able to tell a lot about City's ambitions from their lineup. Our projected team is a pretty balanced one, but if they start Samir Nasri and two forwards, they might be going all-out for a win. If they start one forward, Yaya Toure, Fernandinho and Fernando, they're probably packing everyone behind the ball and playing for a draw.\n\nMartin Demichelis. Just Martin Demichelis. - It's possible that Eliaquim Mangala is now blended into the side and that he'll get the start in this game, but it's more likely that Pellegrini gives him his debut in the Premier League. Pellegrini trusts Demichelis, and will probably start him alongside Vincent Kompany against Bayern. Demichelis has been surprisingly competent, but is still prone to complete meltdowns, and might find a way to lose this game by himself.", "Adam Redman was man of the match when Durham School lost their NatWest Schools Cup semi-final at Allianz Park - Saracens' ground - in March to Warwick 20-15 (read the report here). The full-back, on the books of Newcastle Falcons, scored 10 points, and has been named captain of the green and whites this season. Like former alumnus Geoff Parling, the England and British and Irish Lions lock, he looks set for a career in professional rugby.\n\nRedman's development highlights how the competition remains a showcase for talented players - current England internationals Marland Yarde and Tom Croft won it in their school days. Here the teenager lifts the lid on what last season's run meant to him and discusses how the semi-final experience was \"one of the best days\" of his life, in spite of the result.\n\nIt was really fantastic to play at Allianz Park. The team enjoyed the whole weekend despite losing, and we were really well looked after by NatWest. Actually we were treated like VIPs, so that wasn't too shabby. To play in a stadium was pretty cool, and there were a lot of people there - loads from Warwick who made a lot of noise and generated a great atmosphere which helped to make the event even more special.\n\nCredit must go to our fans who travelled a long way down from the North East. They created one of the best days of a lot of our lives so far, and seeing them down there really lifted us and we will be forever grateful for their support not just then but throughout the whole season. We have very good memories.\n\nI can honestly say that we were pretty devastated after the game. We had come a long way as a team over the course of the year, and had improved with every game - and we had beaten some really good sides throughout the competition. So we went in to the game thinking we could win. To get so close to a Twickenham final was pretty crushing.\n\nWhat was more upsetting was the realisation that his was the last time that we would play together as a team. It sounds corny, but we were really like a Band of Brothers. We all got on so well, had our own music, our own routines, and we looked out for one another. So that realisation hit all of us pretty hard. There were a few tears in the camp.\n\nFor me, it was emotional for the same reasons, but a determination immediately kicked in to want to do it again. I loved the whole thing so I wanted to get back as soon as possible. The lessons learnt were if you don't start well against quality teams, they will punish you, and then they will be out of sight. Also I think Warwick's game management was better than ours. At that level, I suppose it was the difference.\n\nThe whole trip was littered with funny moments, as you would expect. We weren't allowed to use the hotel sauna the night before the game, which for the 'Spice Boys' was a bit of a shame, but in retrospect probably a good decision. Also, on the return journey the coach's toilet broke early on, so - being schoolboys - we resorted to using bottles!\n\nAbsolutely gutted, but it was an amazing experience. And a massive thanks to all the fans that came down and supported us.#FD #greenandwhite -- Adam Redman (@adam_redman)\n\nMarch 8, 2014\n\nJoking aside, the whole experience was great fun, everyone's spirits were high most of the time and we really gelled and came together even more so than ever which we wouldn't have thought was possible.\n\nIn the summer, after the semi-final loss, I really wanted to go to South Africa to experience the rugby culture there. I knew there was top a quality course run by the Investec International Rugby Academy (www.investecacademy.com). The course was run near Cape Town and the Advanced Players Course that I went on was a full week. It was really intense - just as you would imagine anything to do with South African rugby would be.\n\nThe course covered every aspect of rugby possible: mental toughness; fitness; nutrition; recovery; position specifics ... everything. I learnt some Afrikaans as well, although I can't use it in polite company! To give you an idea of the calibre of tuition, former Springbok centres Percy Montgomery and Braam van Straaten were my position coaches - not too shabby! At the end of the course we had a game against one of the top school teams, and it was immense. It was really tough, and I almost got my teeth knocked out on the first tackle - so I thought I had better man up! I will always remember that week. I learned so much and throughly enjoyed it.\n\nWhen back home I played for the Newcastle Falcons in a pre-season game at Doncaster which was an amazing experience. I got a start which was amazing and a bit nervy. The pace and power was the first thing that you notice, but the coaches thought I stood up well so I was really pleased. It was the first 80 minute game I had played so to say I was feeling it would be an understatement! I was playing in a team with top players - and scrum-half Mike Blair is a British and Irish Lions player.\n\nIt was actually a really busy summer because I was also training with the Falcons sevens team, which again was really good for my fitness and also a good learning experience. Durham School is really well known in the region for being able to produce good young players, and we have a couple of guys from last year - Dan Taylor and Jake Elwood - who are in the Falcons programme. In addition, from this year there is Lloyd Purser, Michael Walton, Garry Izomor, Connor Stuart and Charlie Scott who are all with the Falcons Academy. Not bad.\n\nDurham had a good pre-season. We are very fit and we are ready for the new campaign. Our upper sixth seniors this year consist of Michael Walton, Dom Warby, Mark Davison, Lloyd Purser, Henry Wadsworth and Chris Field. All of these guys injured or not really set the tone in the camp, and are so valuable to this squad. That they gained a bundle of first team caps between them last year - and some the year before - really gives them experience, and affords them respect from the younger guys, and that really rubs off. To a man, they always strive to get the best out of the team, themselves and the school. They are a fantastic bunch, of hard working talented guys, who push for the best and won't stand for anything less, they are all very good players for the team and have done a great job so far and I'm sure will continue to do so.\n\nThere are a few jokers, including Lewis Bunce our winger - there is never a dull moment with him and he's always cracking out jokes that are very rarely funny! But there is also a constantly good vibe within the camp, and very rarely a boring moment unless its time to be serious. Being offered the captaincy was a fantastic feeling. The school has been celebrating its 600 year anniversary this year, so it is a historic place. There were others in the team who would also have made really good captains, but I am really pleased Mr Mason and his colleagues chose me.\n\nI like to lead by example and hope I do so, but I am very privileged to have great players and leaders around me. Out of the squad for the Warwick game we have nine guys still here so we will hopefully do well again this year.\n\nPlease send your match details, stories and reports to schoolscup@telegraph.co.uk.", "Exiles confident of springing another upset against Premiership leaders\n\nBrian Smith insists London Irish have no reason to fear Premiership table-toppers Saracens at Madejski Stadium on Saturday (3pm kick-off).\n\nBut Exiles' director of rugby warned that his players will need to stay focused for the whole game if they are to take any points from their first home game in Reading this season.\n\nSmith insists he was neither particularly surprised nor unduly concerned by Saracens' ruthless 39-0 win over Harlequins last Friday.\n\nHe said: \"We won't take too much from that. There have been a few blow-out scores so far in the season.

If you lose a bit of concentration or control of the game for 20 minutes, you can be on the end of a hiding.\n\n\"We knew before Friday that Sarries were a quality outfit. They were in the Premiership final and Heineken Cup final last season. They are as good as any team in Europe.

We respect everyone, but fear no-one,\" added Smith.\n\nFor inspiration Irish need look no further than the last meeting between the sides in February last season.\n\nExiles' shock 22-13 win was the first time Saracens had lost at Allianz Park in the Premiership.\n\nSmith also guided Irish to an impressive 29-16 victory when Sarries last visited Madejski Stadium in February 2013.\n\nHe said: \"We have had a couple of good results against them in the last two seasons, which is pleasing, but they won't count for anything because it is all about this next game.\n\n\"We are playing our first game at home in front of our supporters at Madejski Stadium so it's a big game for us.\"\n\nIrish did just enough to inflict an 18th consecutive Premiership defeat on Newcastle Falcons when they edged home 20-18 at Kingston Park on Sunday.\n\nBut with a tough trip to Leicester Tigers next Saturday followed by a home game against defending Premiership play-off champions Northampton Saints, Smith is keen to avoid coming away empty-handed this weekend.\n\nHe said: \"We want to win the game, but if we can't do that we want to get points out of it.\n\n\"Sarries are a very good setpiece team, but our scrum has been outstanding. We know they will ask questions up front, while defensively they are very strong, so we will have to be accurate in our attack.\n\n\"They also have a very good kicking game so we will have to kick very well too.\"\n\n\"We know it is going to be a big ask and understandably they will go into the match as favourites. We are going to have to improve on our last two performances, but we are confident we can do that.\"", "The dollar traded at almost a six-year high versus the yen as investors weighed the timing for the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate increase since 2006 as policy makers begin a two-day meeting.\n\nA gauge of the U.S. currency (NYBOT:DXZ14) reached the highest level in 14 months amid speculation the Fed will change its stance on keeping rates low for a \"considerable time\" after ending bond purchases.

Milner then completed the comeback with a fine finish into the bottom corner.\n\nThe drama didn't even end there.\n\nAnother goal for the Blues would have meant City topped the group but Pellegrini seemed not to realise, putting Jack Rodwell on and leaving Sergio Aguero on the bench.\n\nRegardless of the maths, the three goals City scored meant the team recorded an impressive victory and showed that they can beat the best sides in Europe.\n\nClick here to read Stuart Brennan's match report from the game , see how the action unfolded on our live blog , and there is a gallery from the game below.", "THE already fractured relationship between the NRL and North Queensland is on the verge of breaking down completely after head coach Paul Green was fined $10,000 for his attack on the game's judicial system in the wake of Tariq Sims' season-ending suspension.\n\nGreen said he had lost faith in the judiciary, and Sims' girlfriend Ashleigh Sudholz added fuel to the fire by accusing the NRL of bias, as the Cowboys once again found themselves at the centre of a finals controversy.\n\n\"Corruption in the NRL much?? @NRL should be ashamed of being so damn bias and having different rules for each team! Its a fn joke,\" Sudholz tweeted before taking down her post.\n\n\"I forgot i have to keep my mouth shut when i see someone i love being treated unfair.

The Cowboys yesterday accepted a five-week suspension.\n\nAs his team prepares to play the Sydney Roosters in a semi-final on Friday night, Green made it known both the club and player accepted Sims' ban \"in protest\", saying their previous experiences at the judiciary in Sydney had inspired little confidence.\n\n\"It would have been a huge disruption for us, and given our record with the judiciary (it was best not to challenge). We took Tariq in last time for a crusher tackle which I thought was nothing in it and he got found guilty so I've got no faith in the consistency of the judiciary, so we felt it's better to just move on,\" Green said.\n\n\"Personally, I was pretty keen to fight the match review panel's grading because I thought we certainly had sufficient evidence to argue for a lesser sentence given what the NRL showed us at the start of the season about what constitutes a shoulder charge.\"\n\nGreen earned an immediate response from NRL head office, with head of football Todd Greenberg saying the NRL could not ignore such attacks on the \u00adintegrity of the judiciary.\n\n\"The members of the match review committee and judiciary have hundreds of games' experience and they do not deserve to have their integrity and credibility questioned,\" Greenberg said in a statement. \"If the club wanted to dispute the charge against Tariq Sims, they could have gone through an independent process and put their case.\n\n\"Instead, they have elected to attack the credibility of the match review committee and that cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nThe Cowboys' official Twitter account said: \"Paul Green says the club has no faith in the match review and judiciary process and that was a reason why we didn't push on with Tariq (Sims).\"\n\nGreenberg said there was a system in place for clubs to challenge charges laid against players.\n\nGreen said Sims' hit was no worse than the shot by Bulldogs giant Tony Williams in the final round of the regular season, which left Gold Coast pivot Aidan Sezer heavily concussed.\n\nThe handling of Sims' case is the latest in a string of major issues between the Cowboys and the game's administrators at finals time and comes as Green prepares for a return to Allianz Stadium -- the ground at which the Cowboys have seen their past two title runs ruined by two referee blunders.\n\nIn 2012 they fell to \"the hand of Foran\" when Manly was awarded a match-winning try despite a clear knock-on by star five-eighth Kieran Foran in the lead-up.\n\nThen it was the \"seven-tackle try\" against the Sharks which left Cowboys players and officials claiming they were victims of a \"Sydney-based conspiracy\" to prevent them claiming a maiden NRL premiership.\n\nWith Sims heading to New\u00adcastle next season, the hard-hitting backrower has played his last match in Cowboys colours, much to Green's dismay.\n\n\"It's cost Tariq, it doesn't seem to cost anyone else in the competition,\" Green said.\n\n\"That's the thing, it's ended not just (Tariq's) season but his career here at the club and unfortunately that's something Tariq has to deal with.

They are big names there.\"\n\nThis will be Stewart's 200th NRL game for Manly -- a remarkable achievement for a player cut down at times by serious injury.\n\nHe has shown resilience, courage and skills many players could only pray for.\n\nAnd his tryscoring feats are simply sublime.\n\n\"I think instinct has got a lot to do with it,\" Stewart said. \"I've also been blessed by being in the same team with some good halfbacks.\n\n\"Probably none better than the two I am playing with at the moment (Kieran Foran and Daly Cherry-Evans).\n\n\"That obviously helps, knowing each other's game. Plus just a lot of hard work on the training paddock.\"\n\nStewart will need to be a leader if Manly is to stay alive this weekend. Belted by South Sydney last Friday night, the Sea Eagles look vulnerable.\n\nAsked about his milestone, Stewart said: \"I don't want to take the focus off the big game, the elimination final, but I am very privileged to say I am up to 200.\n\n\"It's a great club, very historic. If someone had told me 10, 12 years ago that I'd play 200 games, I probably wouldn't have believed them. I feel honoured.\"\n\nHis teammates were full of praise for Stewart.\n\n\"Brett is a legend here at the club,\" Manly centre Steve Matai said. \"Two-hundred games is massive, especially for one club.\n\n\"He is definitely been one of the core group of players that has been here for a long time. I am sure we will all step-up for him and it will be a proud moment for him and his family.\"\n\nProp Jason King added: \"Brett is one of the best players to pull on the maroon and white jumper, that's for sure.\n\n\"The way he been able to adapt his game as well. He was renowned for his speed earlier in his career and had a few nasty injuries too.\n\n\"But now he has become ballplayer, a provider for his teammates. His is an integral part of our team.\"\n\nManly will have to erase the memories of a nasty start again Souths, the Sea Eagles behind 40-0 early in the second half.\n\n\"We will come back to training and work on the little things,\" Stewart said. \"We just did video and picked up a few things.\n\n\"I think they (Bulldogs) will probably try and come through the middle, just like Souths did. We have a lot of work to do around there, we're not shying away from that.\"", "That is the warning from Sea Eagles godfather Ken Arthurson who is not convinced Manly's near-decade of dominance is nearing an end.\n\nThe Sea Eagles 2014 premiership tilt took a serious blow last Friday night when they were belted 40-24 in their qualifying final loss against South Sydney.\n\nFiery forward Anthony Watmough paid the ultimate penalty, suspended yesterday for a week after taking the early guilty plea following a lifting charge on Rabbitoh Greg Inglis.\n\nWith Glenn Stewart, Matt Ballin and Jamie Buhrer all unavailable through injury, Watmough's ban is untimely.\n\nArthurson, the Sea Eagles former boss, said he still has confidence in the squad to stay in premiership contention.\n\n\"I don't think Manly's form of recent weeks is quite as bad as people are suggesting,'' he said ahead of Saturday's elimination semi-final against the Bulldogs at Allianz Stadium.\n\n\"Manly beat Penrith by a point, then Penrith beat the minor premiers (Roosters).\n\n\"So I'm not sure Manly is out of it just yet.

This is knock-out and everyone must produce their best performance.\"\n\nThe Rabbitohs hammered Taufua with bombs last weekend, Canterbury are ready to repeat the serve this Saturday evening.\n\nWatmough's loss will sting a club already without established forwards Matt Ballin, Glenn Stewart and Jamie Buhrer through injury.\n\nBallin may though make a shock return this weekend from a broken foot.\n\nWatmough, Taufua and Ballin did not train on Tuesday. Should Manly lose, Watmough may not play again for Manly with speculation increasing he may be granted an early release to join Parramatta.\n\nDown on troops, there is no doubt Canterbury will attempt to trample Manly through the middle, as Souths did last Friday night.\n\nWatmough yesterday took the early plea to a dangerous throw charge on South Sydney's Greg Inglis and will miss one game.\n\nHe will return for the grand final qualifier, should Manly progress. Had he fought and lost at the judiciary, Watmough would have been suspended for two games.\n\nManly captain Jamie Lyon, who was also in the Inglis tackle, pleaded guilty but avoided suspension.\n\nThe other big suspension news involved North Queensland forward Tariq Sims, who pleaded guilty to a shoulder charge and will miss five games, ending his season.\n\nManly players spoke about Watmough yesterday an hour before he was actually suspended.\n\n\"'Choc' (Watmough) has been one of our best forwards all year,\" said Manly fullback Brett Stewart. \"We need him in the side to win I think.\"\n\nForward Tom Symonds added: \"It (a suspension) would be massive for us. He does so much hard work in the middle. It would be quite a big loss if he happens to miss this week.\"\n\nAsked about the tackle, Symonds said: \"It's pretty unfortunate. It looks like he is lifting him but in most tackles someone comes in around the legs and tries to get them off balance.\"\n\nSea Eagles centre Steve Matai was also disappointed, saying: \"'Choccy' is a big part of our side. He does a lot of work in the middle. If we don't have him this weekend, I am sure we are going to miss him.\"\n\nManly will battle-on still, a club used to overcoming adversity and set backs. If anything, Manly actually thrive on drama.\n\nThey will though have to improve significantly on their effort against Souths, where the Rabbitohs led 40-0 during the second half.\n\n\"We have to be better,\" said Matai. \"And I am sure we will be on the weekend. We have forgotten about last week. That is gone for us now and it is about moving forward and the Bulldogs this weekend.

out the investigation, said the dangerous incident could have been prevented.\n\nThe Kidderminster firm and surrey-based Allianz Engineering Inspection Services, who were contracted to carry out periodic thorough examinations of dye vessels, were prosecuted yesterday at Telford Magistrates' Court.\n\nBrintons Carpets, of Stourport Road, pleaded guilty to breaching Regulation 12 of The

Roosters v Cowboys, Allianz Stadium, 7:55pm\n\nRoosters: Anthony Minichiello, Daniel Tupou, Michael Jennings, Shaun Kenny-Dowall, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, James Maloney, Mitchell Pearce, Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, Jake Friend, Sam Moa, Boyd Cordner, Sonny Bill Williams, Aidan Guerra. Interchange: Mitchell Aubusson, Frank Paul Nuuausala, Isaac Liu, Remi Casty, Kane Evans\n\nComment: Jake Friend (chest) is back from injury at hooker, which pushes Mitchell Aubusson to the bench and Jackson Hastings out of the side. Friend is the best expensive option at hooker given Matt Ballin missed selection for Manly, although cheapie Jayden Hodges (neck) will be hard to ignore if passed fit. Aidan Guerra (suspension) also returns at lock, with Frank Paul Nuuausala dropping to the bench and Kane Evans relegated to 18th man. With guns few and far between this week, Sonny Bill Williams is a must - potentially with the C or VC. Boyd Cordner almost falls into the same category. Mitchell Pearce is in the form of his life, making a Thurston-Pearce halves combo hard to ignore. Sam Moa and Jared Waerea-Hargreaves are point of difference options at prop. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck is an option at fullback, which is the hardest spot to fill this week.\n\nCowboys: Michael Morgan, Kyle Feldt, Tautau Moga, Kane Linnett, Antonio Winterstein, Robert Lui, Johnathan Thurston, Matthew Scott, Rory Kostjasyn, Ashton Sims, Gavin Cooper, Glenn Hall, Jason Taumalolo. Interchange: Ray Thompson, Scott Bolton, Ethan Lowe, James Tamou\n\nOther unavailables: Cameron King (knee, season), Lachlan Coote (ACL, season), Brent Tate (ACL, season), Joel Riethmuller (hamstring, indefinite), Matthew Wright (ASADA ban, season)\n\nComment: Glenn Hall comes into the starting side for Tariq Sims (suspension, season) with Ethan Lowe added to the bench. Johnathan Thurston is the form player of SuperCoach and an absolute must, possibly with the captaincy. Robert Lui has averaged close to 70 in the last six rounds, making his $189,000 price tag very hard to ignore. Matthew Scott is one of three gun options at prop alongside Aiden Tolman and James Graham. Jason Taumalolo remains a buy once again following his barnstorming form, although he was overshadowed last week by Gavin Cooper's great ton. Kyle Feldt produced a poor score on the weekend, but is still an option given his cheap price.\n\nSemi-final No. 2, Saturday, Sep 20, Sea Eagles v Bulldogs, Allianz Stadium, 7:45pm\n\nSea Eagles: Brett Stewart, Jorge Taufua, Jamie Lyon, Steve Matai, Peta Hiku, Kieran Foran, Daly Cherry-Evans, Jason King, Jayden Hodges, Brenton Lawrence, Tom Symonds, Justin Horo, Dunamis Lui. Interchange: Jesse Sene-Lefao, Cheyse Blair, James Hasson, Josh Starling\n\nOther unavailables: Jamie Buhrer (ACL, season), Glenn Stewart (ankle, season), Jake Trbojevic (ankle, season), David Williams (betting suspension, season), Matt Ballin (broken fibula, finals week three)\n\nComment: Anthony Watmough (suspension) is out, replaced by Dunamis Lui in the starting side, with James Hasson returning from injury on the bench. The big winner from Watmough's omission is Tom Symonds, who is near-guaranteed 80 minutes given Glenn Stewart (ankle, season) and Jamie Buhrer (ACL, season) are also sidelined. Matt Ballin (broken fibula) has not been named, but is aiming for a return. Jayden Hodges (neck) is the hooker despite being taken off on a medicab last week. At just $77,000, he is a near-must if fit given the lack of genuine guns at hooker. Daly Cherry-Evans is way over priced given recent form.\n\nBulldogs: Sam Perrett, Corey Thompson, Josh Morris, Timoteo Lafai, Mitch Brown, Josh Reynolds, Trent Hodkinson, Aiden Tolman, Michael Ennis, James Graham, Josh Jackson, Tony Williams, Greg Eastwood. Interchange: Reni Maitua, Dale Finucane, David Klemmer, Frank Pritchard, Moses Mbye, Harlan Alaalatoa\n\nOther unavailables: Lloyd Perrett (ankle, finals week three), Sam Kasiano (ankle, season), Chase Stanley (shoulder, finals week three), Tim Browne (depressed skull fracture, finals week three), Jacob Loko (knee, indefinite)\n\nComment: The horrific injury to Pat O'Hanlon (ankle, season) makes Dale Finucane a point of difference option in the pack. Josh Jackson is an 80 minute man and a near-must given he is available at centre/wing. The same could also be said of Tony Williams and his availability at five-eighth. An all-Bulldog front row of James Graham and Aiden Tolman is a massive option for SuperCoaches, with both performing well above their averages in recent weeks.

there aren't a lot in property who haven't had a scandal,\" chairman Brian White said.\n\nTax office figures show there are \u00adestimated to be more than 534,000 self-managed superannuation funds with assets totalling about $557 billion, which has speared a rise in financial advisers and increased scrutiny within the industry.\n\nMr White said Ray White buyers and sellers called for the advice service as there was scepticism towards untested advisers and property spruikers, where as his company was a household name.\n\nRay White sells property across \u00adAustralia, New Zealand and Asia and offers mortgage products through partner company Loan \u00adMarket and insurance underwritten by Allianz. Wealth Market will be a subsidiary of Loan Market, owned by the White family.\n\n\"When we offer a new service it's generally because our customers have asked for it . . . it amazes me every time we offer another service how quickly it is taken up,\" he said.\n\nThe new company, Wealth Market, has launched a self-named website and has advertised for advisers. It is subject to ASIC approval.\n\nLoan Market has about 1000 brokers - more than 500 work in Australia with offices in each capital, writing about $1 billion worth of mortgages each month.\n\nThe expansion, which comes during a period of change within financial services, is believed to have been planned for about five years.\n\nLoan Market executive chairman Sam White, Brian's son, said the advice service would start with 10 advisers once ASIC sign off was given. In time, it will expand as a franchise.\n\nSam White said products, targeting the mum-and-dad retail market, would not be limited to property investment.\n\n\"We will offer risk advice, superannuation information, debt protection and basically give people more options,\" he said.\n\n\"We've had the option of acquiring financial advice companies but we wanted to start up ourselves, we'll adopt the standard advisory requirements and all brokers will be accredited and fully qualified,\" he said.\n\nSome financial services, such as general insurance, are increasingly being mass marketed through supermarket chains, such as Woolworths and Coles. Banks and specialist advisers have traditionally offered more complex products, typically superannuation and equity investments.\n\nThe recent boom in SMSFs and huge increase in limited-recourse lending to buy property has resulted in many advisers and agents forming one-stop shop companies covering advise, fund establishment, property recommendations and on-going management. But regulators have warned about potential conflicts of interest arising from fee-only advisers being linked with commission earning agents.\n\n\"It is a sales-based company entering a profession just at a time when the financial advisory industry is leaving the sales-based activity for fee-earning advice,\" said Ian Knox, managing director of Paragem, a financial advisor.\n\nMr Knox said it would be \"one of the hardest times to enter the industry\" because of increased regulation. \"I suspect they will need to get the best of the best advisers,\" he added.\n\nSam White said he was confident ASIC approval would be forthcoming.\n\n\"With all the noise around compliance in the past 12 months or so, people have become more aware of the need to seek out property qualified advice, we're keen to make sure that happens,\" he said.\n\nFinancial Planning Association chief executive Mark Rantall stressed the need for quality qualifications to meet the growing complexity of clients' needs.\n\nEstimates for assets held by SMSFs using limited-recourse borrowing arrangements have been revised threefold from $2.6 billion to $8.3 billion.\n\nSMSFs can only use limited-recourse borrowing arrangements when purchasing property.

Considering the outcry that occurred when putting fluoride in the water was first proposed, one can only imagine the furor that would ensue if such a thing were ever suggested.\n\nThe debate, however, is moot. It's a done deal. Mother Nature has already put a psychotropic drug in the drinking water, and that drug is lithium. Although this fact has been largely ignored for over half a century, it appears to have important medical implications.\n\nLithium is a naturally occurring element, not a molecule like most medications, and it is present in the United States, depending on the geographic area, at concentrations that can range widely, from undetectable to around .170 milligrams per liter. This amount is less than a thousandth of the minimum daily dose given for bipolar disorders and for depression that doesn't respond to antidepressants. Although it seems strange that the microscopic amounts of lithium found in groundwater could have any substantial medical impact, the more scientists look for such effects, the more they seem to discover. Evidence is slowly accumulating that relatively tiny doses of lithium can have beneficial effects. They appear to decrease suicide rates significantly and may even promote brain health and improve mood.\n\nYet despite the studies demonstrating the benefits of relatively high natural lithium levels present in the drinking water of certain communities, few seem to be aware of its potential. Intermittently, stories appear in the scientific journals and media, but they seem to have little traction in the medical community or with the general public.\n\nWhen I recently attended a psychopharmacology course in which these lithium studies were reviewed, virtually none of the psychiatrists present had been aware of them.\n\nThe scientific story of lithium's role in normal development and health began unfolding in the 1970s. Studies at that time found that animals that consumed diets with minimal lithium had higher mortality rates, as well as abnormalities of reproduction and behavior.\n\nResearchers began to ask whether low levels of lithium might correlate with poor behavioral outcomes in humans. In 1990, a study was published looking at 27 Texas counties with a variety of lithium levels in their water. The authors discovered that people whose water had the least amount of lithium had significantly greater levels of suicide, homicide and rape than the people whose water had the higher levels of lithium. The group whose water had the highest lithium level had nearly 40 percent fewer suicides than that with the lowest lithium level.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, a Japanese study that looked at 18 municipalities with more than a million inhabitants over a five-year period confirmed the earlier study's finding: Suicide rates were inversely correlated with the lithium content in the local water supply.\n\nMore recently, there have been corroborating studies in Greece and Austria.\n\nNot all the research has come to the same conclusion. There was, for example, a negative study in England, although that is tough to assess because the amount of lithium in that location was much lower than that found in the other countries studied.\n\nA recent review of epidemiological studies of lithium in drinking water reported that 9 out of 11 studies found an association between higher levels of lithium in local water and \"beneficial clinical, behavioral, legal and medical outcomes.\"\n\nTrying to make sense of their results, the authors of the Japanese study speculated that lithium exposure, even in these tiny amounts, might actually be neuroprotective or even enhance the growth of neurons. Other studies have supported their speculation; lithium appears to promote the health, growth and resilience of neurons, reducing stress-induced damage.\n\nOne study found that at the higher therapeutic doses used to treat mood disorders, brain scans of bipolar patients treated with lithium actually had increased areas of gray matter (neurons) in their brains, compared with bipolar patients who had not been on lithium and with normal controls. The authors speculated that lithium might protect the brain, perhaps promoting neuronal growth.\n\nIN the clinical practice of psychiatry, there has been a related finding. Patients with mood disorders have been shown to have rates of dementia higher than those of the general population.\n\nA Danish population study of more than a million subjects discovered that those who purchased lithium only once (presumably people in whom a significant mood disorder had already been diagnosed) had an increased rate of dementia compared with those never exposed to lithium. After taking two or more prescriptions, however, the rate of dementia decreased and remained at those low levels. The authors concluded that, \"continued lithium treatment was associated with reduction of the rate of dementia to the same level as that for the general population.\"\n\nDr. Nassir Ghaemi, a professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine and one of the most active and informed proponents of lithium in the medical community, notes: \"Lithium is, by far, the most proven drug to keep neurons alive, in animals and in humans, consistently and with many replicated studies.\" And, he added, \"If lithium prevents dementia, then we may have overlooked a very simple means of preventing a major public health problem.\"\n\nWhen the data from the Japanese study was reanalyzed in a second publication, the authors concluded that those people with higher levels of lithium in their water supply had lower levels of \"all-cause mortality.\" Why have these findings been so little discussed in the medical, psychiatric and public health communities?\n\nOne could make a case that lithium is the Cinderella of psychotropic medications, neglected and ill used. Reported by an Australian psychiatrist, John Cade, in 1949 to be an effective treatment for bipolar disorder (it was approved as a drug by the Food and Drug Administration in 1970) its efficacy in mood disorders and suicide prevention has been documented as well as or better than virtually any other psychotropic medication. But it retains a grim and undeserved reputation, perhaps because it was originally associated in the public mind with serious mental illness and because, like many medications, lithium can have serious side effects if not monitored properly. As a psychiatrist, I can tell you that because of its stigma, lithium as a medication is a hard sell to patients with serious mood disorders who could clearly benefit from treatment. But there are undoubtedly other reasons for its neglect. Pharmaceutical companies have nothing to gain from this cheap, ubiquitous element.\n\nDr. Peter D. Kramer, the author of \"Listening to Prozac\" and a clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University, wonders whether there hasn't been enough research done on low-dose lithium because \"the mainstream medical establishment distrusts low-dose supplements as somehow ineffective or like homeopathy. And the alternative-medicine crowd shun it because -- though it's a salt found in groundwater -- lithium already has an identity as a powerful, marketed medication for mental illness.\"\n\nLITHIUM has been known for its curative powers for centuries, if not millenniums. Lithia Springs, Ga., for example, with its natural lithium-enriched water, appears to have been an ancient Native American sacred site. By the late 19th century Lithia Springs was a famous health destination visited by Mark Twain and Presidents Grover Cleveland, William Howard Taft, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nLithium drinks were in huge demand for their reputed health-giving properties, so much so that the element was added to commercial drinks. 7-Up was originally called Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda and contained lithium citrate right up until 1950. In fact, it's been suggested that the 7 in 7-Up refers to the atomic mass of the lithium. (Maybe the \"Up\" referred to mood?) Even beer made with lithia water was available.\n\nBy the 1940s, physicians began to give patients with heart disease lithium chloride as a substitute for regular salt, sodium chloride. The high, unregulated doses in this vulnerable population had toxic and even lethal effects. Soon lithium was removed from beverages and other products, and its reputation never recovered.\n\nToday lithium is little discussed despite the huge public appetite for health information. Nor is it much advertised or even available. Scanning the shelves at a local chain store pharmacy, I discovered that standard vitamins did not contain lithium and the nutritional supplement section of the store had no products containing lithium. Lithium was available only in the relatively high-dose medication form that requires a prescription from a physician. Online, however, there are lithium products available including, amazingly enough, the original Lithia spring water.\n\nSome scientists have, in fact, proposed that lithium be recognized as an essential trace element nutrient. Who knows what the impact on our society would be if micro-dose lithium were again part of our standard nutritional fare? What if it were added back to soft drinks or popular vitamin brands or even put into the water supply? The research to date strongly suggests that suicide levels would be reduced, and even perhaps other violent acts. And maybe the dementia rate would decline. We don't know because the research hasn't been done.\n\nFor the public health issue of suicide prevention alone, it seems imperative that such studies be conducted. In 2011, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Research on a simple element like lithium that has been around as a medication for over half a century and as a drink for millenniums may not seem like a high priority, but it should be.", "Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff will introduce a bill Tuesday that provides direct authorization to fight ISIS while also sunsetting the two laws the administration has used to justify current efforts against the militants.\n\nSchiff's authorization for use of military force bill allows the president to use \"all necessary and appropriate\" force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. It also immediately sunsets the 2002 Iraq War AUMF, and does the same to the 2001 AUMF 18 months later.\n\nRegardless of whether a new AUMF is passed, President Obama has said he has all the authority needed to fight ISIS right now from the 2001 and 2002 AUMF laws. It's a justification that's drawn some criticism -- from those who question whether ISIS is covered under the 2001 AUMF at all, to others who note that Obama once vowed to repeal the 2001 AUMF and is now using it to justify this new campaign.\n\nWhether you think the new campaign in Iraq and Syria is a good idea, all Members of Congress ought to put their votes where their mouths are, one way or the other.\n\n* Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee are moving their own more limited bill, providing for assistance to Syrian rebels but putting limits on how that assistance can be carried out.\n\n* Also: It looks like GOP leaders will move that bill separate from a continuing resolution to keep funding the government, averting a shutdown while giving Members something approximating a stand-alone vote on something involving war, as many wanted.\n\n* Michael Tomasky explains why saying we're going to \"destroy\" ISIS is foolish:\n\nWe are not going to \"destroy\" ISIS, to use the word Obama deployed in last week's address...We can't destroy these outfits. They're too nimble and slippery and amorphous, and everybody knows it.\n\nSo why say it? Why not say what we hopefully can do and what we should do: contain it....But no, I guess a president can't say that. A president has to sound like John Wayne. It's depressing and appalling. If he doesn't go cowboy on us, the war hawks will call him a weakling, say he is unfit and unprepared -- and in Obama's case, they will surely add that he is unwilling -- to defend \"the homeland,\" this phrase we're all now supposed to use that carries a slightly totalitarian odor about it.\n\nThere are areas of domestic politics where Republicans feel compelled to talk like Democrats. But when it comes to foreign policy, even the most cerebral of Democratic presidents sometimes feels the need to get his George W. Bush on.\n\n* Jonathan Cohn brings us some experimental poll results showing that as long as you don't mention the Affordable Care Act, even Republicans love the Medicaid expansion, showing once again that the politics of Obamcare are complicated.\n\n* Maggie Haberman gets hold of a polling memo from a liberal group showing why the Dem strategy of linking GOP candidates to the Koch brothers may be effective:\n\nattacks against the Kochs work because they are tethering Republicans to a sense of a rigged system, and that that is overriding President Barack Obama's own weak poll numbers.\n\nThis was always the idea: the strategy of attacking the Kochs is much less about them than it is about making them a symbol for something larger.\n\n* Sahil Kapur details one critical implication of the fight for control of the Senate: the 155 judicial and executive branch nominations pending before the Senate, which Mitch McConnell might not be inclined to pursue as majority leader, with serious long term ramifications.\n\n* It's possible control of the Senate could come down to whether a Dem candidate in Kansas who withdrew will be forced by the GOP secretary of state to remain on the ballot. Rick Hasen lays out some of the issues involved in the court case that will decide the question.\n\n* Jonathan Martin describes how cultural wedge issues like \"Personhood\" are now benefiting Democrats in this election after many years of working for the GOP:\n\nHow Republicans recalibrate could prove vital in many statewide races and in presidential politics as the electorate is reshaped by a growing presence of liberal millennials, minorities and a secular, unmarried and educated white voting bloc....On a host of issues, like gun control, drugs, the environment, race and even national security, this demographic shift has substantially weakened the right's ability to portray Democrats as out of the social mainstream.\n\nMeanwhile, as Martin notes, on another cultural issue -- gay marriage -- Republicans are changing the subject. Mark my words: ten or fifteen years from now, Republicans will say they favored of marriage equality all along.\n\n* At the American Prospect, I interviewed journalism scholar Barbie Zelizer about the ISIS videos and the history of images showing people just before their deaths.\n\n* A large coalition of progressive groups is hammering Senate Dems for going wobbly in the battle against NSA surveillance, an issue that will continue to be a defining one for today's liberal wing of the party. -- gs\n\n* Jonathan Chait asks whether Bill Clinton is really the political genius everyone keeps saying he is.\n\n* And Simon Maloy dissects the mania of Lindsey Graham, America's most terrified senator.", "The Russian government, and specifically Vladimir Putin, has been receiving a lot of praise recently by the American religious right. This is primarily because conservative Christian leaders see Putin as a Christian hero for his push of anti-gay legislation. These same Christian leaders also continuously push conspiracy theories about President Obama's alleged persecution of Christians. All the while, they ignore real persecution of Christian sects that is happening right now in Russia and Russian occupied Ukraine.\n\nRight-wing leaders in the United States have been spending the last several years pushing the Christian persecution myth. The idea is that President Barack Obama, members of his administration, the Democratic Party, and everyone in America who dares not call themselves a conservative Christian is engaging in a conspiracy to \"persecute\" conservative Christians.\n\n\"Greatest minority under assault today are Christians,\" said South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott.\n\n\"If you are an Evangelical Christian, it's a full-blown persecution like we have not seen in America. We now are beginning to wear a badge of honor that we do not want to wear and that kind of persecution that we find in the rest of the world, we're now experiencing it here and it has enormous implications for the future,\" said right-wing activist Jim Garlow.\n\nTony Perkins called President Obama \"totalitarian\" and claimed he is \"colluding with anti-Christian extremists\" to \"neuter the Church.\"\n\nAll of this inflammatory rhetoric regarding an alleged persecution of Conservative Christians in the United States while the Right continuously sings praises about its new hero, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Russians are warming up to religious freedom just as Americans are rejecting,\" said anti-feminist activist Phyllis Schlafly last June.\n\nPat Buchanan, one of the Right's staunchest defenders of Putin, said of him, \"Putin is trying to re-establish the Orthodox Church as the moral compass of the nation it had been for 1,000 years before Russia fell captive to the atheistic and pagan ideology of Marxism.\"\n\nIn the same article in August of last year, Pat Buchanan then defended Russia's jailing of the rock band Pussy Riot for staging events that criticized the Russian government and the Orthodox Church by comparing Pussy Riot's protests to displays of Naziism.\n\nYet, more and more reports are pouring in regarding the way that the newly empowered Orthodox Church has been treating protestant Christians and other religious minorities living in Russia.\n\nSome of these reports of religious persecution in Russia were actually produced by Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network. In 2011, CBN interviewed Yuri Sipko, who runs a large Baptist organization in Russia. The article highlights the problem of a lack of church-state separation according to Sipko.\n\n\"For example, the government recently introduced religious classes based on the principals of the Orthodox Church in public schools,\" Sipko said.\n\n\"Then late last year, the Russian president announced an initiative to appoint Orthodox chaplains to all army units,\" he said. \"Our constitution clearly states no religion can be the state religion.\"\n\nOn August 1 of this year CBN posted another article on its website decrying the mistreatment of evangelicals in Ukraine by pro-Russian rebels.\n\n\"In one of the towns, they even raised the Orthodox flag and said they would fight any heretic, any Protestant, anyone who represents any Western immoral values,\" Sergey Rakhuba said in an interview with Mission News Now that was quoted by CBN.\n\nThese articles essentially lament the lack of church-state separation in Russia that has led to the persecution of religious minorities. Ironically, the idol of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Pat Robertson, repeatedly bashes the idea of church-state separation in the United States.\n\nRobertson is also the founder of the American Center for Law and Justice, which has deep ties to the movement in Russia to ban gay \"propaganda\" and \"blasphemy.\" The ACLJ threw support behind Putin for his anti-gay laws all while they were supposed to be protecting the Evangelical minority in Russia that Putin helps to persecute. The situation in Ukraine has shown that while the ACLJ has been working (with a great deal of success) to pass anti-gay and anti-blasphemy laws in Russia the situation for Russia's Protestants and Evangelicals hasn't changed much. One has to wonder if life wouldn't be greatly improved for Russian religious minorities if the ACLJ had put the same amount of work into protecting them that it had pushing for anti-gay laws.\n\nThe Right's leaders' continued support of Vladimir Putin and their relative silence on the persecution of Russian religious minorities demonstrate that they care more about making sure members of the LGBTQ community are second-class citizens than they do about the human rights of other Christians. It's a frightening look into the mindset of these men and women who are completely dependent upon their belief that LGBTQ people should be held as inferior to them.\n\nJust this past week, a conference in Moscow that was 'canceled' by the World Congress of Families has discreetly gone ahead anyway. National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown was on hand to speak at the conference. Speakers at the summit applauded Russia's anti-gay propaganda laws and called for similar legislation around the world.\n\nOne has to wonder if Brown or any of the other potential speakers will highlight the ongoing campaign of violence against Ukrainian Orthodox Christians and protestants in Eastern Ukraine? Or if they will speak out against the silencing and intimidation of Christian minority groups in Russia itself?", "Thank you Jan for that very generous introduction. And first of all, thank you very much for your dedicated work for Carnegie Europe and your strong engagement in the public debate on foreign and security policy issues.\n\nAnd also a big word of thanks to Carnegie Europe for hosting our event.\n\nAs you mentioned, my very first speech as new Secretary General in September 2009 was also hosted by Carnegie Europe, so I feel that I have come full circle by delivering my last Brussels speech as Secretary General also hosted by the Carnegie Europe Endowment.\n\nBy the way, this Biblioth\u00e8que Solvay also gives me sweet memories. Actually it was in this very room that Heads of State and Government of the European Union agreed on the economic framework for concluding negotiations with the applicant countries in October 2002. Denmark held the rotating presidency of the European Union at that time, so as Prime Minister of Denmark, I hosted the dinner for Heads of State and Government and we reached an agreement on the economic framework for concluding these negotiations which led to the historic decision at the EU Summit in Copenhagen on the 13th of December. An historic decision to enlarge the European Union. And actually the foundation was laid in this very room.\n\nThis is my last month in office as NATO Secretary General. And I have to say these past five years have been the busiest and most challenging - for NATO and for me personally.\n\nNATO has carried out demanding and difficult operations on three different continents. And we have reformed and renewed our Alliance to make it fitter, faster and more flexible.\n\nA New Strategic Concept. The Readiness Action Plan. Smart Defence. The Connected Forces Initiative. Defence Capacity Building. Missile Defence. Enhanced Cyber Defence. These are all major achievements. They demonstrate NATO's continued ability to change and to adapt.\n\nSo, I'm confident that I will be leaving my good friend Jens Stoltenberg an Alliance with a solid foundation and a clear compass. And I am sure that he will do a great job in keeping NATO strong.\n\nKeeping NATO strong could not be more important. There is an arc of crisis and instability that stretches from East to South. And it poses a threat to our populations. And our territory.\n\nWe see challenges on a scale we have not seen for over two decades. And they will endure for years to come. We need to face this fact.\n\nTo the East, there is Russia. We have tried long and hard to build a partnership with Russia. In a way that respects Russia's security concerns, and based on international rules and norms.\n\nAnd, as Jan mentioned, in fact my very first speech as new Secretary General of NATO five years ago was about developing a stronger partnership between NATO and Russia.\n\nRegrettably, Russia has rejected our efforts to engage. Instead, Russia considers NATO, and the West more broadly, as an adversary. Russia has trampled all the rules and commitments that have kept peace in Europe and beyond since the end of the Cold War. The pattern is clear. From Moldova to Georgia, and now in Ukraine, Russia has used economic pressure and military actions to produce instability. To manufacture conflicts. And to diminish the independence of its neighbours.\n\nTo the South there is the so-called Islamic State. Not a state, but a group of terrorists. Who are committing horrific atrocities against thousands of people across Iraq and Syria. I strongly condemn the outrageous murders of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and of the British aid worker David Haines. All NATO allies stand shoulder to shoulder, resolute and united against the scourge of terrorism.\n\nThis group poses even more of a danger as it risks exporting terrorists to our countries. It also controls energy assets. And it is pouring oil on the fire of sectarianism already burning across the Middle East and North Africa. A region that is a tinder box of porous borders. Arms proliferation. Weak governance. And poverty.\n\nWe are confronted by forces that reject our liberal democracy and our liberal, rules-based order. Their agendas and ideologies are different. But they are virulent, violent, and viciously anti-Western. They will grasp every opportunity to undermine our values of individual liberty, freedom, democracy, respect for the rule of law, and human rights. And to impose their backward-looking vision on others.\n\nWe are on the frontline of a new battle - a new battle between tolerance and fanaticism, between democracy and totalitarianism, between open and closed societies.\n\nIn this new age of unrest and revisionism, we must stand strong. And we must stand united as a force for freedom.\n\nStrengthen our collective defence. Strengthen our community of nations. And strengthen our collective engagement.\n\nFirst, we must strengthen our collective defence - our ability to defend our populations and our countries against any threat.\n\nIn response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine, we immediately reinforced our defence and deterrence. And at the NATO summit in Wales, we agreed our groundbreaking Readiness Action Plan. To make sure our response to any challenge is firm and fast. Our defence capabilities, military posture and political will must send a clear signal to any potential aggressor.\n\nWe must also improve our ability to participate in international crisis management. The threat posed by the so-called Islamic State requires a military response to degrade and defeat this terrorist organisation. And it was the credible threat of military strikes against Syria that persuaded the Assad regime to give up their chemical weapons. And it was the principle of responsibility-to-protect that led the UN Security Council to mandate a military operation in Libya. We must be able, ready and willing to step up to the plate when conflicts can affect our own security.\n\nAnd we must improve our ability to help partners build their own security forces. If we train local security forces to take care of local security we can project stability without necessarily projecting large numbers of our own troops. So we must do more to help our partners defend themselves, find their own solutions, and prevent crises in their regions before they emerge. That is why at the Wales Summit we launched a new Defence Capacity Building initiative. As an initial step, we extended it to Georgia, Jordan, and Moldova. And if the new government requests it, NATO will consider a new defence capacity building mission for Iraq, as well.\n\nAll this will require more investments in defence and security. At the Wales summit we turned a corner. The commitment to gradually increase defence investment over the next decade is a strong and united response to the arc of crises surrounding us. Security comes at a cost. But insecurity is much more expensive. And freedom doesn't come for free.\n\nSecond, we must strengthen the global community of free societies that are devoted to democracy, market economy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for the liberal, rules-based international order.\n\nEurope and North America are at the core of the global community. The transatlantic bond is the bedrock of our shared security and our common values. We must continue to strengthen that community, and reach out to like-minded partners across the globe.\n\nWe should invigorate our economies by enhancing economic ties. More trade. More mutual investments. I welcome the free trade agreement between the EU and Canada. And I hope to see a rapid conclusion of negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States.\n\nFreer trade and greater investments will create jobs and set a strong example for others to follow. And a stronger economic partnership will boost our ability to protect and promote an international rules based economic system, whose benefits we all enjoy.\n\nWe should strengthen the strategic partnership between the European Union and NATO. We share 22 members. We share a positive vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace. But we also share difficult neighbourhoods. So we should work even more closely together to deal with those threats and to project stability.\n\nBy bringing new members into NATO and the European Union, we have spread peace, prosperity and progress across this continent. We made clear in Wales that we are actively supporting our partners in Europe to choose their own path. We will keep NATO's door open for new members. We continue to help partners to walk through that door if they so wish, and if they make the necessary reforms. And no third country can have a veto.\n\nOur shared vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace cannot be complete without the integration of the Western Balkans. Montenegro could be an important next step. That's why our door must - and will - stay open.\n\nThe United States and Europe are core partners and allies. But this is not an exclusive club. We should continue to reach out to like-minded partners across the globe. A stronger global community of democracies would help us protect and promote freedom, democracy, free trade and a rules-based world order. Those are the values that forces of oppression violently oppose.\n\nBy working together, the world's free societies can better preserve and bolster our core values. Because to preserve the rules-based global order and our way of life, the forces of freedom, cooperation and modernity must prevail over those of division, dictatorship and destruction.\n\nThird, we must strengthen our engagement in world security. Stand up for our fundamental principles and values. Defend the rules-based international order.\n\nFor decades, the world has profited from a liberal international order, a cooperative order of states observing common rules and norms, embracing freedom, market economy and democracy, and renouncing territorial conquest. A rules-based order that can manage the peaceful rise of new powers. A liberal international order that has facilitated global peace, progress and prosperity.\n\nWe, the citizens of free societies, need to show greater self-confidence in our own values, principles and way of life. Of course, our societies are not perfect. But freedom and opportunities for each individual have tapped undreamt-of resources, and unleashed progress and innovation. The right to choose your own way of life stimulates creativity and energy. The freedom to pose critical questions about established truths and dogmas ensures progress, renewal and development. And the right to speak against those in power contributes to a more open society and a more efficient and transparent government.\n\nI see these values and principles now coming under pressure from forces of oppression. Forces of oppression that want to limit the liberal democracy and trample the liberal international order. Recent events show only too clearly that freedom, democracy and peace cannot be taken for granted. It is for us to stand up for freedom, and defend our freedom.\n\nWe have to be willing and able to use both soft and hard power to protect and promote our values. However, as we approach the end of over a decade of combat operations in Afghanistan, we see pressures to turn inward.\n\nBut the world will not become less dangerous just because we wish it to be. Challenges will not go away just because we look away. So now of all times, we must keep a global perspective. And counter isolationism and retreat.\n\nAny lasting solution to a crisis will always be political. And so diplomacy remains vital. But to give ourselves the best chance of success, we must be prepared to back up diplomatic soft power with military hard power, when necessary.\n\nWe must not only develop the capabilities we need. We must also demonstrate the political will to use them when required. So, I welcome the important efforts by the United States and other Allies and partners to act against the so called\" Islamic State\".\n\nWe have seen, again and again, that crises breed crises. Force is still a factor. And if we fail to defend freedom and democracy, forces of oppression will seize their opportunity. We have seen, again and again, that appeasement does not lead to peace. It just incites tyrants. Any failure to counter oppression will only invite further oppression. That is the lesson of the 20th century - a lesson which we must never forget. So while military action remains the last resort, we must be able to resort to it when we need to. Not to wage war, but to build peace.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nI am very proud to have served this unique Alliance. NATO is the only permanent framework where 28 democracies of North America and Europe consult, decide and act every day to ensure our collective security. After 20 years of challenging operations, we have the most capable and connected forces in history. And we are at the centre of a wide network of security partnerships with countries and organisations across the globe.\n\nThis is a challenging time. A time when our values and our will are being tested. We must rise to the challenge. Resist the pressures to retrench. And remain resolute.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen why we need NATO. The question is no longer \"why NATO\". The question now is about \"more NATO\".\n\nOur Wales Summit has set out a clear course. We need to pursue that course. Urgently. To reinforce the rules-based international order. And remain united today and in the years to come.\n\nWe must preserve our freedom. Protect our people. And promote our values.", "Such is the grim state of affairs in the newly released full trailer for \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1,\" the opening installment of the two-part finale to the blockbuster franchise, which opens Nov. 21.\n\nThe gritty, downbeat trailer, which you can watch above, finds Jennifer Lawrence playing a world-weary, black-clad Katniss Everdeen. \"I never wanted any of this,\" the two-time Hunger Games survivor and reluctant revolutionary says. \"I never wanted to be in the games. I just wanted to save my sister and keep Peeta alive.\"\n\nAlas, there's no turning back for Katniss as rebellion mounts in the post-apocalyptic society of Panem. Unlike the previous two films, the \"Mockingjay\" movies won't center on the actual Hunger Games -- the kill-or-be-killed teen tournament -- but instead will broaden the scope of the action to war and politics, with Katniss leading the charge against the totalitarian Capital.\n\nAs directed by Francis Lawrence, who returns from \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" the \"Mockingjay\" finale promises to pick up on and even amplify the dark elements from the previous films: The two-minute trailer includes images of artillery stockpiles, towns bombed into rubble and Stormtrooper-like soldiers firing on crowds.\n\nBased on the best-selling young-adult novels by Suzanne Collins, the first two \"Hunger Games\" movies were of course massive successes, combining to gross more than $1.5 billion at the worldwide box office.

Now 46, she tells the Birmingham Mail: \"[He is] right, it's a bit dated now.

If he was, Page 3 would have vanished, whereas it carries on, day after day.

The Guardian reported this case on 23 November 2009, whereas, Davies points out, \"not one other national newspaper carried a single word about it\". A detail he omits is that The Guardian was as remiss as the rest of us in foreseeing the significance of this hearing. It was all credit to Steve Turner, who runs the British Association of Journalists, who commissioned a freelancer, Paul Donovan, to cover it. Donovan sent his report to The Guardian, which published it under two staff journalists' bylines.", "Nato has described Russia and Islamic State (IS) as the two main threats to Western security, but says it can still talk to Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen likened Russia to IS in a speech at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels on Monday (15 September).\n\nHe said: \"Russia considers Nato, and the West more broadly, as an adversary. Russia has trampled all the rules and commitments that have kept peace in Europe and beyond since the end of the Cold War ... from Moldova to Georgia, and now in Ukraine, Russia has used economic pressure and military actions to produce instability, to manufacture conflicts\".\n\nHe noted that IS \"risks exporting terrorists to our countries ... [it is] virulent, violent, and viciously anti-Western. They will grasp every opportunity to undermine our values\".\n\nReferring to Russia and IS together, he added: \"We are on the frontline of a new battle - a new battle between tolerance and fanaticism, between democracy and totalitarianism, between open and closed societies. In this new age of unrest and revisionism, we must stand strong and we must stand united as a force for freedom\".\n\nAnswering questions at the Carnegie event, Rasmussen noted that the two threats are different, however\n\nHe said Russia is trying to create a frozen conflict in east Ukraine to prevent it joining the EU or Nato and that \"we should never accept that\".\n\nBut he ruled out use of force to halt Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't think Russia poses an imminent threat to Nato allies,\" he said.\n\n\"For Ukraine, we do believe the right way forward is a political solution and while it's clear Russia has violated international norms and rules, I still think Russia is capable of this [a political solution] if they decide to do so\".\n\nThe Nato head advocated use of force against IS by what he called a \"coalition of the willing\" inside Nato.\n\nThe US-led group includes six EU countries - Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the UK - as well as Australia, Canada, and Turkey.\n\nRasmussen added that UN rules give them the right to attack IS to stop \"genocide\" in Iraq and Syria and as an act of \"self-defence\".\n\n\"As far as I can see, there is a basis in the fundamental UN charter principles to conduct a military operation against ISIS [an alternative name for IS]\", he said.\n\nHe urged the UN to do more on post-conflict state-building to prevent the kind of disorder which erupted in Libya after Nato strikes toppled the old regime.\n\nHe also excused Turkey for not letting the anti-IS group use its air bases, noting that IS is holding hostage several dozen Turkish diplomats.\n\n\"I have to say, I consider Turkey a staunch ally\", he said.\n\nAsked about Scotland's Nato prospects if it splits from the UK in this week's referendum, Rasmussen said it would have to reapply to join.\n\n\"If a new country wants to join Nato it must apply to join and such an application will be addressed in the same way all applications are dealt with and, eventually, it will require consensus, unanimity in the alliance to accept a new member\".\n\nHe added that Nato has not discussed the Scottish question.\n\nIt normally takes Nato aspirant states several years to join. But he hinted that Scotland's application might proceed quickly, because pace of progress is based on fulfilment of technical criteria.\n\nEU Observer", "Baghdad -- While security forces in Baghdad focus on stopping the advance of Islamic State militants, residents of the capital are falling victim to an increase in opportunistic crime which is threatening the fragile bonds that have held neighborhoods together.\n\nThe rising crime, violence, and sectarian tensions are driving families to leave their homes or the country if they can.

Give us your money and your gold.' \"\n\nThe leader of the gang put a gun to her daughter's head, and led her upstairs where she handed over all of their cash and jewelry. \"It was all my wedding jewelry,\" says Alaf, a widow. \"There was jewelry my mother gave me.\"\n\nWorst of all, she says, the thieves said they knew her.\n\nAs the Islamic State group started taking over large parts of Iraq, the country's most revered Shiite religious leaders issued a call for their followers to join Iraqi security forces in protecting their shrines and cities.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city, militias have set up checkpoints to reinforce the Iraqi army and federal police. Masked young men dressed in black and carrying AK-47s stop and search vehicles. During the summer they moved into schools in many Baghdad neighborhoods to train volunteers.\n\nMany Iraqis worry they have over-stepped their mandate - moving beyond preventing the IS from taking root to acting as a de-facto police force effectively operating outside the bounds of law. Some say they worry about a return to the days of Iraq's civil war with battles in the streets and militias running death squads.\n\nWhile officials acknowledge that it will not be as easy to deactivate the militias as it was to activate them, some say there was no other option.\n\n\"Sometimes you have no choice - you have an enemy and they were talking about destroying Baghdad,\" says Brig. Gen. Saad Maan, spokesman for the Baghdad Operations Command. \"What can you do? You must protect Baghdad - this was the choice.\"\n\nThere are no reliable statistics on crime, but anecdotal evidence indicates a rise in armed robberies, car thefts, and kidnappings. Brigadier General Maan says police and intelligence forces are making progress in fighting organized crime, recently cracking 35 gangs that were operating kidnapping rings in Baghdad.\n\nSome of the gangs are believed to have links to the Islamic State group. Others are ordinary criminals taking advantage of the security vacuum.\n\n\"This is a dismembered society,\" says Saad Eskander, a political scientist. \"America did not dismember it, it was already dismembered and held together by force by Saddam Hussein.\"\n\nIn the last 11 years, Iraq has gone from a totalitarian regime built on a system of informants and mutual suspicion to a country plunged into war. Ethnic, religious, and social divisions have deepened as regions, tribes, and even families have fragmented under the strain of a country tearing itself apart.\n\nIn Baghdad in particular, Sunni Muslim Iraqis are continuing to leave neighborhoods they have lived in for decades as Shiite militias put down roots.\n\nAlaf says she didn't recognize the men who robbed her but believes they live in the same neighborhood. \"They said, 'We know you.' When the police came, they took photographs of the crime scene and later asked for money to 'develop the photos.' \"\n\nLike most Iraqis, Alaf kept her money at home rather than in a bank. She says the thieves took almost $50,000 in cash and jewelry. They even took her paycheck and the last 25,000 dinar note - about $20 - from the wallet of her daughter, a medical student.\n\n\"I worked hard for my money,\" says Alaf, who taught in Libya to support her family after her husband died. \"It was my life's savings.... It broke my heart. I feel like someone died,\" she says.\n\nAfter gathering the money, gold, and their cell phones, the thieves locked Alaf and her daughter and granddaughter in a bathroom. Neighbors alerted by another daughter, who was worried when her mother didn't answer, broke the door down three hours later.\n\nHer granddaughter, Miriam, seemed unfazed by the robbery. Alaf, though, says after living in the house for 16 years, she jumps at every noise.\n\nWhen the police failed to turn up any leads, Alaf did what many Iraqis do: She consulted a fortune-teller.\n\nShe says the woman, who reads the past and future in patterns of salt, told her exactly what had happened and where the men were living.\n\n\"She said they live a few streets away. I asked her to tell me their names but she refused,\" says Alaf. \"She said 'I don't want to get involved.'\"", "NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that members of the U.S.-led alliance must stand shoulder to shoulder to confront simultaneous security threats from Russia and the Islamic State extremist organization.\n\nIn his Brussels farewell speech as NATO's top civilian official, Rasmussen said the alliance finds itself on the front line of a geopolitical division between \"tolerance and fanaticism,\" and \"democracy and totalitarianism.\"\n\n\"We must stand strong as a force for freedom,\" said Rasmussen.

Russia has trampled all the rules and commitments that have kept peace in Europe and beyond since the end of the Cold War ... from Moldova to Georgia, and now in Ukraine, Russia has used economic pressure and military actions to produce instability, to manufacture conflicts\".\n\nHe noted that IS \"risks exporting terrorists to our countries ... [it is] virulent, violent, and viciously anti-Western. They will grasp every opportunity to undermine our values\".\n\nReferring to Russia and IS together, he added: \"We are on the frontline of a new battle - a new battle between tolerance and fanaticism, between democracy and totalitarianism, between open and closed societies. In this new age of unrest and revisionism, we must stand strong and we must stand united as a force for freedom\".\n\nAnswering questions at the Carnegie event, Rasmussen noted that the two threats are different, however\n\nHe said Russia is trying to create a frozen conflict in east Ukraine to prevent it joining the EU or Nato and that \"we should never accept that\".\n\nBut he ruled out use of force to halt Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't think Russia poses an imminent threat to Nato allies,\" he said.\n\n\"For Ukraine, we do believe the right way forward is a political solution and while it's clear Russia has violated international norms and rules, I still think Russia is capable of this [a political solution] if they decide to do so\".\n\nThe Nato head advocated use of force against IS by what he called a \"coalition of the willing\" inside Nato.\n\nThe US-led group includes six EU countries - Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the UK - as well as Australia, Canada, and Turkey.\n\nRasmussen added that UN rules give them the right to attack IS to stop \"genocide\" in Iraq and Syria and as an act of \"self-defence\".\n\n\"As far as I can see, there is a basis in the fundamental UN charter principles to conduct a military operation against ISIS [an alternative name for IS]\", he said.\n\nHe urged the UN to do more on post-conflict state-building to prevent the kind of disorder which erupted in Libya after Nato strikes toppled the old regime.\n\nHe also excused Turkey for not letting the anti-IS group use its air bases, noting that IS is holding hostage several dozen Turkish diplomats.\n\n\"I have to say, I consider Turkey a staunch ally\", he said.\n\nAsked about Scotland's Nato prospects if it splits from the UK in this week's referendum, Rasmussen said it would have to reapply to join.\n\n\"If a new country wants to join Nato it must apply to join and such an application will be addressed in the same way all applications are dealt with and, eventually, it will require consensus, unanimity in the alliance to accept a new member\".\n\nHe added that Nato has not discussed the Scottish question.\n\nIt normally takes Nato aspirant states several years to join. But he hinted that Scotland's application might proceed quickly, because pace of progress is based on fulfilment of technical criteria.", "Jan Russ was a successful casting director, known for launching the careers of people like Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kylie Minogue and Dan McPherson but she had a deep dark secret that not many people knew about.\n\nJan has revealed the drama that is her life, on the Australian Story, and the pain and guilt she harboured as a teenage girl.\n\nHer tumultuous story starts in 1965 with a teenage pregnancy and how she had no say and was forced to surrender her baby girl, a decision which still haunts her today.\n\n'Rejection and shame and guilt were the three emotions that I carried with me my whole life,' Jan said.\n\nShe started to do local theatre shows and that's where she met a guy that she called her boyfriend, they just had sex once but it only took one time and she fell pregnant.\n\n'I was absolutely terrified to tell my parents, I was just in a total state of shock I didn't know how to handle it, what to do, I was terrified I was scared,' she told Australian Story.\n\nJan hoped for a fairytale, that her boyfriend would ask her to marry him but her life was shattered when he asked to adopt her baby and didn't want to be roped in to getting married young.\n\n'That to me was like an arrow through the heart,' said Jan.\n\n'Your head is full of fear and guilt.

This is just wishful thinking because the reality, the obvious reality, is the exact opposite.\n\nChina and Russia helped arm and train the various African nations in the fight to end white colonial rule not because they were outraged to see the oppression and exploitation of one race by another - They did not give a damn about that. China was oppressing and exploiting the Tibetans, for example, in its own backyard and has continued to do so to this very day. Russia was doing the same.\n\nThe rallying call throughout Africa in the drive to end white colonial rule was \"One man, one vote!\" I would like to believe that at least some African nationalists subscribed to the notion that every man and woman - regardless of race, tribe or whatever else - must have a meaningful say in the governance of the country as the essence of freedom, liberty, human dignity and the only sure guarantee of peace, justice and economic prosperity. Sadly, those nationalists' voices were very quickly drowned and never to be heard as soon as China or Russia became the partner is the fight to end colonial rule.\n\nOne of the conditions for China and/or Russia assisting the African nationalists was that the independent African nation would replicate the communist totalitarian system of government and NOT adopt a democratic system of government. It was not just a matter of ideology; both China and Russia were looking at turning the African countries into their own spheres of influence. Indeed the two nations competed one against the other to the point of the dividing the nation when they happened to support two different nationalist groups.\n\nJoshua Nkomo and his PF Zapu were sponsored by the Russians and Mugabe and his Zanu PF was sponsored by the Chinese. There was no love lost between these two nationalist parties but superimposing the deadly rivalry between two Asian totalitarian regimes on their proxy Zimbabwean nationalists only made matters worse. China trained the Zanu PF fighters and supplied the weapons with which to fight on the clear understanding that Zimbabwe would repay the debt after independence and God knows what sweet deals Mugabe has granted the Chinese over the years to repay the debt.\n\nMugabe and Zanu PF professed to be Maoist socialists and they swiftly moved to impose a de facto one-party dictatorship soon after the nation got its independence. Professing to be socialist was one thing but living like one was a different matter. Mugabe looked to China for his political ideology but when it came to buying his cars, clothes and all the other material luxuries, the tyrant and his cronies looked west! The generosity of the western countries to Zimbabwe in terms financial assistance helped cement Mugabe's relationship with the democratic west.\n\nWhen Mugabe's relationship with the west started to sour over the former's repeated human rights violations, including the failure by up hold free, fair and democratic elections; the Chinese were only too pleased with these developments, because the souring relationship with the west forced Mugabe firmly back into its camp.\n\nOf course there are huge financial gains to be made by doing business with a country other nations will not do business with; the profit margins are high, very high, because there is less competition and, more often than not, there is no transparency either. There are vulture nations like Israel, Lebanon and, the biggest of them all, Chinese who love doing business tyrants of pariah nation like Zimbabwe. For the last 15 years the vultures have been flying into and out of Zimbabwe, gorging themselves on the nation's diamonds and other resources whilst millions of our people have been forced to live in abject and grinding poverty.\n\n\"RUSSIA is set to launch what could become Zimbabwe's biggest platinum mine when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visits the country next week to sign the deal,\" reported New Zimbabwe on 12 September, 2013. Of course the Russians are well aware that many other countries have been shying away from Zimbabwe because the country reeks of corruption. Russia is not itself repelled or unaccustomed to the smell, and there is nothing like the sight of another vulture drop-ping like a stone to attract others to head the same direction.\n\nThe Chinese are in Zimbabwe already and now the Russians too are coming; and they are coming for one purpose and purpose to join in the pillage of the country. Mugabe has been selling the nation's wealth and resources cheaply for decades to finance his and the ruling Zanu PF elite's lavish lifestyles. Now that the nation's ability to generate wealth has ground to a halt the tyrant is selling the nation's land, mineral wealth and anything else he can for a song to these vulture nations whose only interest is to milk the nation as much as they can and as quickly as the can.\n\nCountries like China helped fight and end western colonial rule in Zimbabwe but the people of Zimbabwe having not benefited from having a corrupt and tyrannical communist puppet regime after independence. No amount of propaganda from people like Manheru will change the facts on the ground that Zimbabwe's economy is but a sorry image of what it was before independence and that Mugabe has sold nation's future to the Chinese and other vulture nations.\n\nOn the political front, Zimbabweans are still to enjoy all the basic human rights and freedoms other people take for granted including the right to a free vote and the right to life itself! In his 34 years in power, Mugabe has murdered over 30,000 innocent Zimbabweans for selfish political gain.\n\nManheru - the only thesis Mugabe has ever had was to hold on to power at all cost; the Chinese, Russians and all the other vulture nations are in Zimbabwe to exploit Mugabe's pariah status for their own selfish gain. All your talk of them having \"seen and appreciated Mugabe's thesis that superpowers are born through beneficent relations with the rest of the Third World\", is all propaganda and nonsense.", "PARIS -- A small portrait of Anne Sinclair as a blue-eyed little girl hangs in her impressive townhouse on the Place des Vosges here. Nearby, there's a late Picasso watercolor of a figure in a wide-brimmed black hat. A replica of a Picasso still life -- the original is in a vault -- has pride of place above the living-room fireplace.\n\nThe artwork is a legacy of Ms. Sinclair's maternal grandfather, Paul Rosenberg, the art dealer of Picasso, Braque, Matisse and others, who amassed a vast collection of French art -- and a fortune -- before his business was confiscated by the Vichy government. The family survived, but more than 400 paintings were lost, of which 60 are still missing. Last fall, a Matisse emerged in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt, and the family is trying to recover it.\n\nPaul Rosenberg is the subject of Ms. Sinclair's new book, \"My Grandfather's Gallery: A Family Memoir of Art and War,\" which is being published in the United States this week, two years after its release in France. The book is something of a comeback for Ms. Sinclair, one of France's best-known television journalists and now the editorial director of Le Huffington Post, the site's French incarnation, after years in which she was perhaps best known as the wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn.\n\nHers is a life with powerful themes -- art, Nazis, Jews, money, power, sex -- and several next acts. In a wide-ranging conversation last month that touched on art (inspiring), the media (racing to the bottom), anti-Semitism in France (worrisome but not unduly), French politics (depressing) and the Mideast (even more depressing), Ms. Sinclair, 66, came across as friendly, approachable and warm. Her face was topped by dark bangs. She wore a black-and-white silk blouse, black slacks and pink lipstick, and her red-painted toes were visible through peep-toe heels.\n\nBut she didn't reveal much about her inner life. Nor would she talk much about \"the incident,\" as she called it. \"What happened three years ago was not the brightest side of my life, but I can't be summarized to that,\" Ms. Sinclair said in fluent English, sitting in a low swivel chair at a small glass table in her high-ceiling study. \"All this has been very painful, but it's far behind now.\"\n\nShe said she started writing the book in 2010, when she was living in Washington with Mr. Strauss-Kahn, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and wrote the final pages while living with him under lockdown in a TriBeCa apartment, hounded by tabloid reporters, during the months between his arrest in New York in May 2011 on charges of assaulting a hotel maid, and that July, when the charges were dropped.\n\nThe portrait of Ms. Sinclair as a little girl was done by Marie Laurencin, a rare woman in the male-dominated world of Cubism, the muse to the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and the first artist to sign with Rosenberg's gallery, in 1913. \"She always made black eyes,\" Ms. Sinclair said, pointing to another small Laurencin portrait hanging above hers. \"And when she painted me, I said, 'Please, I have blue eyes.' \"\n\nEven as a child, Ms. Sinclair knew how to look after her image. Over the years, she has honed those skills. With media savvy, excellent timing and one of the best Rolodexes in France, she pulled off a significant feat: Emerging from a grotesque scandal with her dignity largely intact. She stood by Mr. Strauss-Kahn when his libertine tendencies were revealed to the entire globe, bailed him out of jail and then, after the headlines faded, the couple quietly divorced in 2012.\n\nIn her most extensive comments on the scandal, in a documentary about her life shown on French public television in April, Ms. Sinclair said she hadn't known about most of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's extramarital adventures. \"You can believe me or not,\" she said. \"But I didn't know. I didn't know.\"\n\nChristine Ockrent, a journalist who came of age with Ms. Sinclair on French television in the 1980s, when Ms. Sinclair hosted \"7 sur 7,\" France's equivalent to \"Meet the Press,\" said that Ms. Sinclair \"has a great deal of sympathy in French public opinion.\" Ms. Sinclair left the program, where she was known for her Socialist leanings and hard-nose questions, in 1997 to avoid conflicts of interest after Mr. Strauss-Kahn, whom she married in 1991, was named France's finance minister.\n\n\"And well-deserved sympathy,\" Ms. Ockrent added, \"because she has behaved extremely decently by our standards.\"\n\nSome feminists disagree. In 2011, the French journalist Nabila Ramdani wrote that \"the deceit of Sinclair being a role model for put-upon women\" was \"repulsive\" and \"glossed over the fact that she has never criticized the excesses of Strauss-Kahn's behavior toward women.\"\n\nLately, Ms. Sinclair's restraint has been seen in contrast to the tell-all approach of Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, a journalist and the former partner of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, whose gossipy book about her time at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace -- and her attempted suicide after she learned that Mr. Hollande had taken another lover -- was published in France this month.\n\nThat isn't Ms. Sinclair's style at all. \"I think private life is private life,\" she said. In \"My Grandfather's Gallery,\" she writes, \"I loathe absolute transparency, finding it voyeuristic at best and a bit totalitarian at worst.\"\n\nMs. Sinclair, who was born in New York City, writes that she had always been more interested in politics than art and identified more with her father, who worked for the Free French Resistance forces during World War II, changing the family name from Schwartz to the nom de guerre Sinclair, which he found in the New York phone book.\n\n\"My Grandfather's Gallery\" seems less an attempt at self-revelation than an effort to introduce her origins after years of not highlighting them. \"I wanted to build my life and career, not by being an heir,\" Ms. Sinclair said. In the land of egalit\u00e9, she added, discussing one's wealth was simply not done. \"In America, you're proud if you have money, because you earned it and don't have to hide it,\" she said. \"French people, they don't like so much people that succeed. So succeeding is always, how would you say, louche.\"\n\nBy the time her memoir appeared in France in 2012, it was seen as part of Ms. Sinclair's rehabilitation project. Had it come out in 2011, as originally planned, it would have explained her family fortune -- built on culture, that most precious French commodity -- to potential Socialist voters for Mr. Strauss-Kahn. Before his fall from grace, he had been expected to announce his candidacy for leadership of that party. (Until she paid $1 million to bail her husband out of jail, most people, even in France, had little idea of her background.)\n\n\"The book was basically written for the election campaign, then the news changed that,\" said Christophe Barbier, the editor in chief of L'Express, a French weekly. The more left-wing currents in the Socialist party were not enthused about the couple's wealth. Rapha\u00eblle Bacqu\u00e9, a journalist for Le Monde and an author of \"The Strauss-Kahns,\" said, \"There's a big part of the left that contested her as 'gauche caviar,' \" roughly, a limousine liberal.\n\nThe book begins when Ms. Sinclair -- who writes that she once posed for a statue of Marianne, the embodiment of France displayed in government offices -- goes to renew an identity document and a bureaucrat questions her about her French bona fides. That, and her mother's death in 2006, prompts a backward look.\n\nPaul Rosenberg, who died in 1959, when Ms. Sinclair was 11, inherited the gallery from his father, a former grain merchant who had switched to dealing in Impressionist art. In 1910, Paul set out on his own, opening a large gallery in the fancy Eighth Arrondissement of Paris. \"If visitors were unsure about Braque or L\u00e9ger, Paul invited them upstairs to see softer-contoured works by Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir or Auguste Rodin,\" Ms. Sinclair writes.\n\nRosenberg sold works by G\u00e9ricault, Ingres, Delacroix, C\u00e9zanne, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Gauguin, Bonnard and Modigliani, among others. But he was particularly close to Picasso. After they met in the south of France in 1918, Picasso gave Rosenberg the right of first refusal on his paintings.\n\nIn 1919, Picasso's first exhibition at Rosenberg's gallery introduced his post-Cubist work. Over the years, the artist and dealer exchanged many letters, now in the archives of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris, which is reopening this fall after a long renovation.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, with war on the horizon, Rosenberg had the good sense to send works abroad and lend others to museums, including the nascent Museum of Modern Art, whose first director, Alfred Barr, was a close friend. After war was declared in Europe on Sept. 3, 1939, Rosenberg moved his family to New York. They arrived in 1940 and stayed until 1945. Paul opened a New York gallery, which his son, Alexandre, Ms. Sinclair's uncle, kept until the 1980s.\n\nMs. Sinclair writes that when Rosenberg, a World War I veteran and patriot who was hazy on the grim reality back in France, was informed in 1942 that his family had been \"denationalized,\" he sent a fruitless telegram to the leaders of Vichy, stating: \"I am learning of my denationalization by order of 23 February 1942. Protest energetically and have strong reservations. Letter follows.\"\n\nBut \"My Grandfather's Gallery\" isn't an angry book. Ms. Sinclair says that in general, France has owned up to its wartime sins. As for members of her family, they \"just suffered materially,\" she said. \"Of course, the artworks were looted but, well, they didn't die.\"\n\nMs. Sinclair said the family was in touch with German and Swiss authorities about \"Seated Woman\" from 1923, the Matisse painting found last fall in the Gurlitt collection. Of the more than 400 paintings recovered from Paul Rosenberg's original collection, Ms. Sinclair has kept four major works, inherited from her mother, but declined to reveal what they were or if they included the Picasso above her fireplace.\n\nIn France, there is a popular perception that Ms. Sinclair must have sold some art to finance Mr. Strauss-Kahn's legal bills, but she said that wasn't the case. Still, in 2007, she sold Matisse's \"L'Odalisque, Harmonie Bleue,\" inherited from her mother, which fetched $33.6 million at Christie's.\n\nBack then, it looked as if Mr. Strauss-Kahn stood a chance of becoming president of France. Now, Ms. Sinclair professes, somewhat unconvincingly, that she wasn't hoping for that. \"I've seen the political scene so closely for years that I never dreamt to be part of it,\" she said. \"But as I've said to my children and as I said to my husband: 'Well, if it is your life, your feeling. If you want to go, I'll follow. But I'm against it.' \"\n\nToday, Ms. Sinclair seems content. She enjoys working with Le Huffington Post. \"She's truly exceeded all my expectations,\" said Arianna Huffington, adding that Ms. Sinclair, \"a natural\" on TV, was helping the site expand its web video operation. This fall Ms. Sinclair will start a radio interview program. She is now together with Pierre Nora, a French historian and publisher.\n\nQuestions linger. What goes through a woman's mind when she chooses to stay with a husband like Mr. Strauss-Kahn? What would she say to the hotel maid, Nafissatou Diallo, if she met her? Perhaps if Ms. Sinclair had been interviewing herself, she would have asked these questions. \"Yes,\" Ms. Sinclair said, standing beside the Picasso watercolor.\n\nShe smiled. \"And I wouldn't have answered them.\"", "This special issue of Telos investigates the concept of the West. Far more than a geographical term, in intellectual, philosophical, and cultural history, it has been common to speak of a Western tradition in order to name lineages of thought from antiquity to the modern world. In cultural and political debates, Western values are invoked that are linked historically to a deep tradition specifically dedicated to desiderata such as freedom and individual dignity: at stake is the general possibility of any long-term tradition, the durability of culture over time, but also this very specific, distinctively Western tradition as the carrier of particular values. Politically this usage explains the reference to Western democracies (as opposed to the \"peoples' democracies\" of the Soviet era) with the suggestion that democratic political forms and norms have emerged from the \"Western tradition\" and have generated the institutions of both liberal democracy, i.e., democratic procedures that assert popular sovereignty, while simultaneously protecting individual rights, and market economies shaped by the rule of law and the protection of private property.\n\nThe West moreover can alternatively be understood ex negativo in terms of the alternatives with which it is contrasted, e.g., the \"East,\" whether in the Communist sense of the Cold War or with regard to variations of what in recent decades were referred to as \"Asian values.\" How can we talk about the forms of human experience outside the West? Sometimes invocations of the West imply a particular tradition, tied to a certain delimited terrain, but precisely because that Western tradition also involves appeals to equality, transparency, and human rights, the scope of the term can stretch into a kind of universalism, as if everyone, by virtue of merely being human, were somehow already fundamentally Western. Such an expansionist usage of the term runs the risk of undermining its validity: if everyone is already \"Western,\" than the designation may become meaningless or at least redundant. Yet, in contrast, any strictly exclusionary definition that would allow for distinguishing between what is inside the West and what stays on the outside runs counter to the universalist sensibility that underpins much of the discourse on the West. This tension between a particularist and a globalizing understanding of the West pervades the debate. Does the West have any limits? Who might be empowered to draw them and on what grounds? Would an exclusionary agenda protect a core Western substance, or would it not actually betray the universalist aspiration that defines the West?\n\nThis sort of instability in the term itself raises questions about the immanent weaknesses of the West. For all of its grand accomplishments, triumphalist accounts of Western civilization only go so far, as many critics of various stripes point out, and their arguments should not be ignored. Most compelling perhaps are the immanent critics who direct our attention to the West's frequent failures to live up to its own ideals. Are Western societies ever as successfully egalitarian as their self-descriptions claim? Are their political institutions unproblematically democratic? Why was the liberal West of the rights of man so implicated in the project of European colonialism? This distance between theory and practice has been painfully clear. However rather than merely dwelling on these discrepancies for propagandistic purposes to denounce the West, the important challenge is to inquire carefully into the conclusions to draw from the West's difficulty in meeting its own expectations. Is the problem with the norms themselves or the insufficient attempts to reach them? And are past failures reliable indicators of future prospects?\n\nOne reasonable response involves precisely insisting on the validity of the norms, upholding the Western values, and arguing politically and historically for an ongoing process of realizing them: the West should become ever more Western. Identifying injustice is the first step in correcting it, akin to J\u00fcrgen Habermas's understanding of modernity as a not-yet-complete project. In this view, we need to devise institutions that would allow us to pursue more effectively the values at the core of the tradition. Alternatively, however, others may draw the melancholy conclusion that the norms themselves are untenably empty dreams, self-contradictory, impossible to realize, and bound to disappoint. This critique of the West opens the door to a dark cynicism that eventually concludes morosely that the inequality that abides demonstrates the ultimate impossibility of equality. This is the sort of conclusion that the post-Heideggerian critique of \"Western metaphysics\" has propounded. Finally, other radical critics of the West reject its values and its institutions in order to opt positively for decidedly illiberal alternatives: such is the critique of the West inherent in the visions of Soviet Communism, German Nazism, and contemporary Islamism. All three developed programs for societies emphatically hostile to the core components of liberty at the heart of the West. For all their specific historical differences, they share the totalitarian contempt for individual freedom, and they have all therefore waged war on the West. More unites these several anti-Western traditions than divides them, just as today's fellow travelers of Islamist anti-Westernism borrow freely from their Communist and Nazi forebears. Understanding \"the West\" necessarily involves recognizing these enemies. For the political (and international relations) discourse, the \"West\" refers primarily, if not exclusively, to the competition with the Communist world; for the contemporary humanities discourse, \"the West\" refers primarily to questions of colonialism, post-colonialism, and the polemics around \"Orientalism.\" Today's debates are marked by the intersection of these genealogies. Advocates of the West should not be afraid to name their opponents.\n\nThe East-West competition of the Cold War appeared to come to an end twenty-five years ago, on November 9, 1989, with the opening of the Berlin Wall, leading soon to the reunification of Germany -- one of the epicenters of the East-West divide -- and the collapse of the Soviet Union. A binary era that had begun in 1917 seemed to stop, relegating the duality of Communism and Capitalism to a historical past. To be sure, the competition between the United States and Russia had deeper roots in the nineteenth century, but for the better part of the past century the two superpowers were viewed through the lens of alternative political-economic systems and their associated values. With the disappearance of that paradigm, the standing of the notion of the West grew unclear, even at its moment of apparent triumph: why worry about the West any longer, if the East has disappeared? Hence the premature thesis of the end of history, as if wars of ideas had suddenly become obsolete in a world of unchallenged liberal capitalism: because the whole world appeared to be becoming exclusively Western, the West seemed to surrender its distinctiveness during that giddy transitional decade of the 1990s. Globalization posed a further challenge to a coherent notion of the West, as Western fashions, practices, and representations spread around the world, immigration diversified Western populations, and, to the extent that \"Western\" came to imply \"modern\" and \"developed,\" Asian countries -- Japan, India, and China in particular -- lost their radical difference. Although part of a geographical East, they could lay claim to their own developed, modern, and, indeed, Western standing (leading as well to internal discrepancies, e.g., between the Westernized portions of coastal China and the less developed hinterlands).\n\nThe terrorist attacks in New York and Washington of September 11, 2001, brought that dreamy interregnum to a bitter conclusion. Expectations to the contrary, history was not over, and the West rediscovered itself in the war with the jihadist East. Through the military escalations in Iraq and Afghanistan, a Western agenda -- relying on a broad alliance of participants, although clearly under U.S. leadership -- emerged around goals of democratization, as articulated especially in George W. Bush's second inaugural address where he described a commitment to the global promotion of democracy. In practice, that goal proved tragically elusive, while doubts about the validity of the goal itself spread through the debates of a war-weary American public. The foreign policy of the Obama administration has followed in the wake, defined largely in terms of a radical reduction of U.S. power and engagement in the world, the destabilizing withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, and -- another legacy of the na\u00efve illusions of the post-Cold War -- the \"reset\" with Russia. Yet very quickly that dream dissipated. Russian loyalty to the Assad dictatorship in Damascus, the annexation of Crimea, and the incipient war with Ukraine put an end to that effort to heal Cold War wounds, and with that the East-West competition returned with a vengeance. As little as the Obama administration sought confrontation and as much as European trade interests would prefer comfortable business as usual with Moscow, the patterns of the Cold War divide have suddenly become unmistakable.\n\nIn addition to its historical and political vicissitudes, the concept of the West is a crucial point of reference in the intellectual traditions that have animated Telos. For Marx, the overriding historical narrative described the progress of economic and political forms of the West, and Marxism never shied away from contrasting Western dynamism, which it celebrated, with the backwardness of \"Asiatic\" societies. For Max Weber, the distinctiveness of an occidental rationality defined modern European society, although for both Marx and Weber the fascination with the achievements of the West, especially its capitalist economy, was tied tightly to a critical understanding of its negative consequences: for Marx, these included exploitation and poverty, and for Weber, bureaucracy and alienation. For the philosopher Edmund Husserl, the Western, or rather European, philosophical project remained crucial to a humanistic universalism that provided a basis for an alternative to the threatening irrationalism of fascism during the 1930s. Finally, for the Frankfurt School of Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, the West reappeared as the notion of enlightenment itself, with its potential for freedom as well as its simultaneous capacity for domination. This dialectic also marked a split within that Critical Theory tradition, with Adorno firmly rejecting Soviet Communism as well as the violence of the student movement, while Herbert Marcuse endorsed the movement of the 1960s and the New Left. Its reception of Leninist anti-imperialism betrayed its affinity for Moscow -- the New Left very quickly ceased to be very \"new\" -- by articulating a critique directed against the colonialism exclusively of the Western liberal democracies but never of the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, for which it was happy to offer apologetics. In this through-the-looking-glass world, Western allies such as Israel became targets of vitriolic attacks, while the abuses of anti-Western regimes, such as in Castro's Cuba or Mugabe's Zimbabwe, were ignored or even celebrated, in a tradition of selective internationalism: solidarity for some, contempt for others.\n\nWithin the academy, this New Left anti-Westernism merged with philosophical currents in continental philosophy, as a post-Nietzschean, post-Heideggerian rejection of Western rationality turned into a third-worldist or post-colonial political rejection of Western power. This distorted perspective still defines the left academy today. Its hard-wired instincts place it on the side of any dictators that self-identify as opponents of the West, it refuses to criticize restrictions of rights carried out by those regimes, and it thrives in a world of double standards. Do not look to that academic left to protest the crushing of the Green movement in Iran or to condemn Syria for gassing its citizens; it rails against the security fence in Israel, designed to keep terrorists out, but never uttered a critical word about the wall in Berlin, which kept a trapped population in. Such are the practical consequences of a reified anti-imperialism: Leninism frozen in amber, hostile to the Western tradition, and enamored exotically with the other, any other, as long as it is not Western. Ultimately, we face a profound gap between this cultural discourse of the academic world, caught up in dogmatic ideologies, and the realist, let alone an idealist, discussion of foreign policy. The communities that participate in both are intensely interested in politics, but they have little to say to each other. This deep gulf between significant parts of academic life and the political world weakens our culture.\n\nWith this issue of Telos, we hope to open up a discussion about the prospects for the West, including both the cultural and political dimensions. In recent decades, during the post-Cold War period, U.S. foreign policy has lurched between the notional unilateralism of the Bush era (although it was never as unilateral as its adversaries insinuated) and the Obama administration's commitment to the universalism of international law (although it has been prepared to break those rules when it deemed it necessary). A serious revisiting of the \"West\" will hopefully generate new perspectives adequate to current foreign policy challenges, especially as the competition between East and West reemerges as the defining feature of world affairs. A broad discussion of the West, its past and its prospects, is urgently needed, and we hope that this issue of the journal will contribute to it.\n\nJeffrey Herf opens the discussion with a clear recognition that the West is not monolithic. On the contrary, it has always involved multiple cultural traditions. While some strands have had disastrous results, others have in fact triumphed over tyranny and spread human freedom: Nazi Germany built on Western legacies, but so did the Allied effort to oppose it. The failures of the Western tradition do not cancel out its achievements and prospects: the history of slavery is not somehow proof of the impossibility of freedom. Understanding this potential in the West and the role of the United States in leading it, Herf worries about the invisibility of the West in American university history curricula, particularly given the continued indispensability of the United States as a force for good in the world. In his words: \"The United States must lead what we can still call the free world, or else the liberal international order will not be effectively defended. The defense of the better traditions of 'the West,' those of individual liberty, equality of citizenship, the rule of law, political and intellectual freedom, of pluralism and compromise as a tradition depends now, as much as it did during World War II and the Cold War, on the willingness of the United States to lead.\" This is the strong case for the West: despite undeniable failures, a history of true and significant accomplishments reflecting a realization of values, rooted in tradition, and in the past century driven by American leadership.\n\nYet there are cogent critics of this account. While Herf insists on the necessary role of the West and U.S. leadership, Michael Kimmage provides a sobering alternative, a lucid argument regarding a hypothetical decline of the West as a factor in U.S. culture and politics. Do Americans still really see themselves as part of something called the West? Once they certainly did. The emergence of the United States as a world power during the First World War overlapped with an American educational culture that was decidedly European and historical in its orientation. These tendencies converged dramatically in the first three post-FDR presidencies, all decidedly Western, even if with different nuances. Those American leaders and their public understood the United States as embedded in a tradition, which it had a responsibility to preserve and defend. (The widespread study of Latin in public high schools was a clear expression of this self-understanding.) According to Kimmage, that era has passed. The experience of the Vietnam War ended the political self-confidence of the West, and a combination of multiculturalism (which he views effectively as an inward turn toward U.S. minorities) and globalization (a turn beyond Europe) undermined the privileged place of the West in American education. He therefore concludes with the stark verdict that the term will soon only have antiquarian significance. The West will quickly be forgotten, he claims, and with it the traditional foundation for American leadership. In a similar vein, Charles Hill presents, in a rhetorical tour de force, a dystopic retrospective on the West, which once represented a combination of ideas and politics that aspired to extraordinary brilliance but which failed due to its own internal flaws. The hyperbole of Hill's narrative and its crushing discouragement suggest that it is intended as a warning rather than as a summative judgment. Yet even if it is a literary satire, his vision is unsparingly bleak, and his prospects for the West are slim, unless a dramatic reversal of fortune takes place. Kimmage and Hill are the challengers to Herf's ambitions.\n\nAs a philosophical agenda, the West draws on the liberal tradition. However, as a political project, the West involves state power and the formation of an interstate alliance. Is there some tension between the liberalism of individual rights and its unavoidable corollary, the politics of state power? David Pan gets at this question through a reading of two German political thinkers, J\u00fcrgen Habermas as the theorist of the liberal public sphere and communicative rationality, and Carl Schmitt with his focus on the originary violence of political order. Even liberal democratic states depend on force; even the rational West has to be able to recognize its opponents and decide to resist them. Advocates for democracy should be prepared to defend it, but the deployment of violence is not inherently democratic: engaged in battle, soldiers do not call for a vote with the enemy. As Clausewitz underscored, the goal of war is the imposition of one's will on the adversary, not a polite conversation among equals. Furthermore, a key point in Pan's account involves a reading of Goethe's bildungsroman, Wilhelm Meister, and how it famously stages the conflict between bourgeois life, i.e., liberal democratic culture, and the aesthetic representation of power. Pan's account thereby highlights some of the immanent tensions within the West. Even democratic states require power and strategies of representation. Luca Castellin's essay continues with similar themes of power in his portrait of Reinhold Niebuhr and his evaluation of the American role in history in the aesthetic terms of an ironic discrepancy between virtue and realism. For all of its ideals, the West is not a suicide pact and has to be prepared to use force to defend itself. The question from the 1930s may become germane again: do democracies have the will to fight?\n\nIn contrast to the primacy of power implied in Pan's adjudication between Habermas and Schmitt, Adrian Pabst enters a plea for a different model of international relations, an \"associative commonwealth,\" built on substantive reciprocity among participating parties rather than on either abstract principles or forceful domination. Broadly historical and philosophical, his essay calls for a rethinking of international politics as such in order to allow for this new form of alliance, which in turn would mirror other social relations, and not only at the international level. The space of commonwealth is lodged somewhere between the individualism of market liberalism and the heavy hand of statism. Pabst's argument borrows from a postsecular critique of modernity that allows him to advocate this \"neo-medieval\" form, which seemingly might apply not exclusively to the West. Yet Pabst, like Herf, ends with a full-throated defense of the West, even if his philosophical foundations are quite different from Herf's. \"The West can either fracture and split permanently, abandoning international relations to unipolar hegemony or multipolar anarchy. Or else it can redefine its covenantal destiny, aspiring to be a genuine beacon to the rest of the world and to cooperate with other nations toward the same, shared ends of virtue, honor, and mutual flourishing.\" His phrasing deftly captures the options of the historical moment by trying to identify an alternative to the impoverished choice between single-power hegemony and anarchic disorder. He describes the third option for the West as \"covenantal,\" a term that points to the need for cooperative alliances held together by trust and shared values.\n\nThe next two articles probe the cultural substance of the longer Western tradition, in particular the Judeo-Christian inheritance. Mary Frances McKenna traces the synthesis of the legacies of Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem, with particular attention to the crucial congruence of faith and reason. She underscores the important role religion has played in Western history, not as a source of conflict (as which the contemporary atheist agenda sometimes denounces faith) but as a source of freedom. Meanwhile, Angelo M. Codevilla defines the West against globalizing tendencies by drawing clear boundaries against other cultural regions. At stake however for him are the foundational ideas of the West, Greek philosophy and the Judeo-Christian revelation as the sources of Western values. Both McKenna and Codevilla underscore the derivation of recognizably liberal desiderata from the specific Western synthesis of revelation and philosophy: Benedict's Regensburg address casts a long shadow here.\n\nThe final essay in this issue, by Gerard Williams, steps outside the West itself to look at Chinese political culture. A seemingly unexpected concluding topic to this special issue, the China question turns out to be crucial. The connections to the West are in fact multifold, and not merely in the sense of a grand competition. Is China the conclusion, the Aufhebung of the West? Or are the two fundamentally similar? For Williams, Chinese culture, like Western culture in some traditional views (including Leo Strauss's account to which he refers), involves an ongoing dialogue with its foundational texts. In addition, China's ongoing progress will require, so Williams argues, an appropriation of liberal education as it was once known in the West (and, as Hill and Kimmage bemoan, may no longer thrive). \"China's rise represents the eve of the decision upon the decline of the West. Perhaps, among all the high cultures it is most with China that the fate of Western civilization and its stewards will be decided. It is in confrontation with China that the cardinal objects of liberal republicanism, the benefits of open markets, the rule of law, the rights of freedom and the privilege of the West's happiness, pleasure and enjoyment, the vital spirit of its secular democratic traditions and polities, will be tested in their international pre-eminence.\" Can China emerge from one-party rule and, in effect, become the better West? Or can the West through its encounter with China rediscover its own cultural depth? When all is said and done, Williams's account is not only about China but also about how the rise of China raises the question of the West and the possibility of its renewed viability in a profound way. It involves a significant cultural challenge, quite different from the strategic and military rediscovery of the West in the face of Putinist Russia.\n\nThis issue of Telos concludes with two short book reviews, one on the letters of Thomas Sowell, which touch on aspects of the politics discussed in this issue, the other on the fiction of Daniel Fuchs, which explores transformations of twentieth-century America, the problem of the culture industry, and a different \"West\" as part of the American imagination.", "HUTCHINSON, Kan. -- In his 40 years living in Kansas, Konrad Hastings cannot remember voting for a Democrat. He is the type who agonizes over big purchases, trying to save as much money as possible. He is against stricter gun laws, opposes abortion in most cases and prefers less government involvement in his life.\n\nBut when he casts his ballot for governor in November, he plans to shun the leader of this state's conservative movement, the Republican incumbent, Sam Brownback, and vote for the Democratic challenger.\n\n\"He's leading Kansas down,\" said Mr. Hastings, 68, who said he voted for Mr. Brownback four years ago, when he easily won his first term. \"We're going to be bankrupt in two or three years if we keep going his way.\"\n\nVoters like Mr. Hastings are at the heart of Mr. Brownback's surprising fight for political survival.\n\nAlthough every statewide elected official in Kansas is a Republican and President Obama lost the state by more than 20 points in the last election, Mr. Brownback's proudly conservative policies have turned out to be so divisive and his tax cuts have generated such a drop in state revenue that they have caused even many Republicans to revolt. Projections put state budget shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, raising questions of whether the state can adequately fund education in particular.\n\nThis has boosted the hopes of the Democratic candidate, Paul Davis, the State House minority leader, who has shot up in the polls even though he has offered few specifics about how he would run the state. Many disaffected Republicans might give Mr. Davis their vote because, if nothing else, he is not Mr. Brownback.\n\n\"There's just a lot of negative momentum behind Brownback, and Davis has been hammering that home,\" said Chapman Rackaway, a political-science professor at Fort Hays State University.\n\nThe governor's campaign has appeared so worried about his weak poll numbers that it took the unusual step last month of releasing an internal poll that showed the race to be essentially tied, hardly something that would usually be showcased.\n\nIn some ways, it is unsurprising that many Kansas Republicans have turned on Mr. Brownback. This is a state that once had a tradition of centrist Republicans, like former Senator Bob Dole, and has had five Democratic governors over the past half-century.\n\nBut much of this moderation went by the wayside as Mr. Brownback and conservative majorities in the Legislature turned the state into a laboratory for the policies they had run on. In addition to passing the largest income tax cuts in state history, they have made it easier to carry guns in public buildings, turned over management of Medicaid to private insurance companies, made it more difficult to get an abortion, and made it harder to qualify for public assistance.\n\nEven some of Kansas' staunchest Republicans have found some of these measures to be too far to the right. More than 100 current and former Republican elected officials have endorsed Mr. Davis.\n\nMr. Brownback, 58, a former United States senator who grew up on a Kansas farm, has defended his record and is trying to force Mr. Davis, who is from Lawrence, home of the University of Kansas in one of the state's most liberal regions, to define himself.\n\n\"He's been mostly just hiding as a candidate,\" Mr. Brownback said in an interview. \"All his statements have been basically against me, and none of it has been what he would do.\"\n\nThe governor has painted Mr. Davis as a supporter of President Obama who wants to raise taxes and force the president's health care law on Kansans.\n\nMr. Davis has hammered away at the \"governor's economic experiment,\" as he put it in a debate held at the State Fair, saying it had left Kansas with a vast budget deficit. \"It's damaging our schools. It's hurting our economy. It's jeopardizing our future,\" he said.\n\nMr. Brownback has also been set back by matters unrelated to lawmaking. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported in April that federal authorities were investigating the fund-raising and lobbying activities of some of his associates.\n\nAs Election Day draws closer, both sides can expect an even tighter, and perhaps rougher, clash, with outside groups stepping up their involvement.\n\nThe Republican Governors Association has run television ads attacking Mr. Davis and linking him to Mr. Obama. The Brownback campaign's ads have sought to paint a rosy financial picture for the state. Political analysts expect Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group founded by the Koch brothers, the Wichita-based billionaires, to step in, too.\n\nThe Kansas Values Institute, a left-leaning advocacy organization, has run negative ads about Mr. Brownback. Mr. Davis has run an ad that said Mr. Brownback was taking the state in the wrong direction. But he also had to pull one of his television ads after it was revealed that one of the actors had been arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute.\n\nMost criticism of Mr. Brownback has centered on the tax cuts, which slashed individual income tax rates and eliminated taxes on nonwage earnings for nearly 200,000 small businesses. The most recent fiscal year ended with state revenues more than $300 million short of expectations.\n\nBased on decreased revenue from the tax cuts, the state's nonpartisan legislative research department estimates that the budget will have to be adjusted by $1.3 billion, either through spending cuts or additional revenue, over the next five years in order to remain balanced.\n\nOpponents of the governor have used this to stoke fears that he would cut vital services. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have downgraded Kansas' credit rating.\n\nMr. Brownback said that the steps he had taken on Medicaid, on bolstering the teachers' pension system and on cutting taxes had been needed to stabilize state finances, and that revenue growth would resume. The tax cuts will attract new businesses and residents -- and, in turn, cash -- to the state, he said. And because he has reduced the size of government and made it more efficient, he said, state revenues do not need to grow that much to fulfill budget obligations.\n\nAs promising signs, the governor and his allies point to an increase in the number of private-sector jobs since the tax cuts went into effect in January 2013. They also promote a record number of new business filings -- more than 15,000 -- in the state last year as a sign that businesses were attracted to Kansas.\n\nSpending is also an issue. Mr. Brownback said he would not cut funding for education or other essential services, and since taking office he has increased the total state dollars that go toward primary and secondary schools by more than $200 million. He has put tens of millions of dollars toward new programs for technical education and reading initiatives.\n\nBut most of the increase has gone toward things like teacher pensions and building maintenance. When adjusted for inflation, state spending on classroom-related expenses has remained flat, if not decreased slightly, each year, according to an analysis by Mark Tallman of the Kansas Association of School Boards.\n\nSo far, Mr. Davis, 42, the son of two teachers, has spoken mostly in broad terms about his priorities -- improving public schools and investing in work force training and higher education. \"We know that if we have a highly skilled work force, industry will come,\" he said.\n\nThe only specific plan he has put forward is to freeze Mr. Brownback's tax cuts next year and to appoint a commission to address tax issues.\n\n\"I'm not giving people the illusion that this is the magic bullet that's going to fix the very, very deep financial problems that Governor Brownback has caused,\" said Mr. Davis, a lawyer who joined the House in 2003 and has been minority leader since 2008. \"But I think it is a good first step.\"\n\nRay Merrick, the Republican speaker of the House, called freezing the tax cuts a nonstarter. \"Right now, the Legislature on both sides, House and Senate, are on the side of the governor,\" he said.\n\nThe question is whether most voters will stand with the governor. \"I'm not sure that some of the tax policies have been as effective as we'd like them to be,\" said Dianne Blick, a 58-year-old development officer from Hutchinson, who has usually voted for Republicans but is undecided in this race. \"Either candidate has to really convince me that they can create positive change and can work across the aisle.\"", "A tumour derailed Toronto mayor Rob Ford's re-election bid. But don't worry, he'll be back, says Jennifer Hough\n\nA WEEK is a long time in politics, but in Toronto, what a difference 48 hours made.\n\nMid last week, the Rob Ford re-election juggernaut was chugging along full-steam ahead.\n\nIn second place in the polls, despite his past indiscretions, the infamous crack-smoking mayor was writing a comeback narrative Bill Clinton would be proud of.\n\nFord's unlikely redemption story began in earnest in July, when he returned from a stint in rehab.\n\nPromising that his crack-smoking -- and alcohol-soaked -- days were behind him, he vowed to work harder than ever for the city he loves.\n\nThe last few months have seen him wheeling out his usual populist sound bites: that he alone is the guardian of the taxpayer, champion of the little man, dedicated to making the city work efficiently, unlike the downtown \"elitists\", he so despises.\n\nHe revelled in the release of councillors' expenses -- he and his brother, from a wealthy family, don't claim a cent from the city.\n\nAnytime the media broached the subject of his past, Ford opined it was a \"personal attack.\" He had moved on, everyone else should too.\n\nControversy was never far away. During the Ford family's annual barbecue, Ford Fest, supporters verbally, and physically, attacked gay rights protesters.\n\nThe mayor has historically refused to back gay rights, or attend Toronto's Pride event, and remained seated while the city council gave a standing ovation to organisers of Toronto's World Pride festival this summer.\n\nSo last week, things were ticking along as normal in this world of cartoon politics, and a visit and endorsement from Mike Tyson, boxing legend -- and convicted rapist -- was just another day in the circus of city hall.\n\nTyson called Ford \"the best mayor Toronto has ever had\", before telling a TV reporter live on air to \"go fuck yourself, you rat piece of shit,\" for bringing up his rape conviction.\n\nThen, on Wednesday evening, the news broke: Ford had been rushed to hospital with a large tumour on his abdomen.\n\nHis older brother, and campaign manager, Doug held a press conference. And in true Ford-style, said little, and asked the media for privacy, refusing to speculate on his little brother's political future.\n\nCould it be that Ford, not because of crack-smoking, chronic drinking, alleged domestic violence, and involvement with known gang members, would be forced out of the mayoral race because of a health matter?\n\nOn Friday the city got its answer. \"People know me as a guy who faces things head-on and never gives up, and as your mayor I have done just that,\" Ford said from his hospital bed.\n\n\"I derailed the gravy train, cut unnecessary spending and made government more accountable. I did this by facing these challenges head on.\"\n\n\"Now I could be facing the battle of my lifetime, and I want the people of Toronto to know that I intend to face this challenge head-on, and win.....My heart is heavy when I tell you that I'm unable to continue my campaign for re-election as your mayor.\"\n\nTorontonians, for a fleeting moment, believed the city was to be free from the Ford family's clutches. But the elation was short-lived. Ford, as leaders in totalitarian regime do, anointed his brother and campaign manager Doug, to take his place.\n\n\"I've asked Doug to finish what we started together, so that all we've accomplished isn't washed away... I have asked him to run to become the next mayor of Toronto, because we need him. We cannot go backwards.\"\n\nWith a 2pm deadline to file election papers looming, there began a frantic chase to see if Doug could get in the race.\n\nWith eight minutes left, the papers were signed, sealed, delivered. The end result of some almighty last-minute shuffling: Doug is running for mayor, Rob is running for his old council seat, and, in another twist to the tale, their nephew Mikey -- who was taking his own shot for Rob's seat -- is running for the Toronto District School Board.\n\nAs for the elder Ford, it seems unlikely the more abrasive, aggressive and disliked of the two, can finish what his little brother started.\n\nIt means -- just in case anyone cares -- candidate John Tory, currently out in front in the polls, will likely win.\n\nA respected businessman, he is as unFord as you can get, and endeared himself even further to Torontonians last week by branding Doug an \"insult machine.\"\n\n\"I don't think Doug Ford offers Toronto more of the same. In fact, he may offer Toronto something worse,\" he said, upon hearing of his entry.\n\nToronto heads to the polls on October 27, but with Rob down and out, Ford Nation's Hollywood ending may have to wait, likely till 2018, when Ford the younger, certain to retain his council seat, will no doubt launch another bid for the city's highest office.", "All Blank Canvas performances are in the Blank Canvas Theatre (at 78th Street Studios), 1305 West 78th St., Suite 211, Cleveland.

Truman. Here he is in 1937 before he got his goddam pinko-nazi hands on the tiller:\n\nOf course, Truman had taken over from the despotic Roosevelt whose number one agenda throughout the 1930's was to target and persecute freedom loving, peaceful republicans:\n\nToday's persecuted 1% should just be thankful for the freedoms they now enjoy, they owe it to the billionaires who struggled against and suffered under the despotism, tyranny and totalitarianism of earlier regimes.", "A few hours after Apple's press conference Tuesday, a spokesperson from a mobile payments startup sent along a note detailing the company's coming integrations with Apple's newly announced payment system. She remarked that in 30 minutes, Apple did what no one else could in 10 years: \"move mobile payments from a nice-to-have to a must-have.\"\n\nIt's a common refrain among technology types. But the belief that Apple Pay will turn the payments industry on its head draws on a long-held assumption in the tech industry that the Internet (the virtual network where no one know you're a dog) and the physical marketplace (where the bartender already knows your name) live by the same rules. In fact, these two marketplaces operate under much different dynamics, which will eventually push Apple's efforts into a much different direction than most people think.\n\nApple Pay, two ways\n\nFirst, let's quickly review the way the system works. Apple Pay will allow iPhone users to pay participating partners using their existing iTunes account. Partners can integrate the software into an application, point-of-sale system or online checkout just as they do with PayPal or Amazon buttons. Then Apple plays intermediary, passing the data through notoriously complex components of the payment industry.\n\nBut the core technology of Apple Pay -- the system that allows it to encrypt payment information on a device and hook into the existing payment structures -- needs to be separated from the way in which the technology can be used. On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook laid out two potential scenarios for the system: one, a virtual payment -- the type of ecommerce transaction we've made for years -- and two, a proximity payment made between two nearby devices via near field communication (NFC).\n\nTo understand Apple Pay, it's important to look at the viability of each scenario within their respective markets.\n\nThe ecommerce market, where the virtual payments would be made, is still relatively young. Online, critical institutions such as payments remain not only inefficient -- but structurally incomplete. Despite the efforts by retailers and technology companies, the rate at which consumers abandon goods in their digital shopping carts has remained at or above 70% for years. These are legitimate problems that govern the growth of the marketplace as a whole.\n\nIn that sense, Apple Pay fits Apple's strategy of entering a market which has seen substantial investment but still has yet to capture the consumer's imagination. The idea of building a payments mechanism into the operating system is the type of innovation that's needed. That's why Apple Pay will likely have a meaningful impact on the way we buy goods online almost immediately.\n\nOffline payments are a different animal. The industry is dominated by a set of entrenched competitors, each of which plays a small role in the process of moving money from customer to provider. It's at once extraordinarily uncompetitive and remarkably efficient. Plus, the economics of the offline payment industry put the pricing pressure on the merchant, making changes in business models -- a frequent vehicle for disruption -- relatively inert for the consumer.\n\nFrom a consumer perspective, paying offline is not a problem. That's why nearly every major project focused on driving users to pay with their phone has failed. PayPal's project is still fledgling, Google's wallet struggles, and Square ditched its mobile payment app -- a project that was once considered the future of the company and offered a comparable, if not better experience than Apple Pay in-store.\n\nHowever, the projects that have focused on the merchant side of the equation -- namely, mobile credit card readers from Square, PayPal and others -- have taken off. What's more, they are actually driving consumer adoption. A study from Javelin Research found that the introduction of mobile credit card readers, which effectively expanded the total addressable market for credit cards, has coincided with a 10% decline in the amount of cash consumers spent in 2013 from a year earlier.\n\nA virtual industry building for a physical world\n\nThe variations here expose an often overlooked structural difference between physical and virtual markets. Online, the near perfect parity among sellers -- our ability to buy from Burma as easy as Boston -- means that success of a seller is often determined by their ability to rapidly respond to consumer preference. Subsequently, the consumer drives the market in an almost totalitarian manner.\n\nThat's a relatively new phenomenon. In physical markets, the constraints of proximity create a collage of independent microcosms in which sellers sell to certain consumers and consumers buy from certain sellers. That scarcity reduces competition and decreases the likelihood for a seller to invest in say, a new point-of-sale system or payment processing capabilities such as Apple Pay.\n\nGiven the explosion of the Internet over the past two decades, the technology industry tends to approach problems from a virtual mindset. They tend to overemphasize the role of the consumer in driving change in a market, and underappreciated the critical role that the sell-side plays in its evolution. For local technology, that has led to a lot of money poured into projects with little return.\n\nThis is not to say Apple Pay will fail. When the most powerful technology company in the world puts its weight behind something its hard to bet against it. For one, iPay, or more-so NFC, will decimate Square, PayPal Here, and the dongle card reader market. The company has eliminated the need to use a dongle, positioning the iPhone or Google Wallet in a perfect position to take over the very small business market where it got its start.\n\nBut Apple's success in local will not come from the proximity use case that Tim Cook showed off Tuesday. In local, its success will largely come from integration with Uber, Grubhub, and other booking and scheduling services where the transaction occurs virtually and redemption occurs locally.\n\nEventually, we will reach singularity, and the division between man and machine, physical and digital will be trivial. Until then, companies need to build for both worlds.", "By Mike Roller - American troops are back in Iraq. About 500 have been assigned to protect the U.S. embassy and Baghdad's airport; the remainder are assessing the state of the fight between Iraq's government and rebels from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nWith U.S. troops potentially in harm's way once again, it's worth remembering how we've protected them in Iraq in the past.\n\nI am a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, when Iraq had the fourth-largest army in the world and the United States Army wasn't even in the top ten. The Iraqi forces that invaded Kuwait were experienced combat veterans, fresh from an eight-year war with Iran. America's military, on the other hand, had not fought a full-scale combat operation since Vietnam.\n\nWith that backdrop, the nightly news warned that America would suffer tens of thousands of casualties if we engaged this superior foe. Much of America's media assumed we were about to repeat the \"quagmire\" of Vietnam.\n\nWhat no one realized at the time was that the Tomahawk Cruise Missile would set the stage for one of the quickest and most lopsided victories in the history of warfare -- a victory which was sealed in the opening hour of the first night.\n\nDuring that hour, hundreds of Tomahawks were launched, knocking out Iraq's command and control. Prior to the Gulf War, wars concentrated action along the front lines where the two forces faced off with headquarters commanding and controlling from behind. The losing side would hear explosions getting closer to their headquarters until it was overrun by an advancing enemy or they surrendered.\n\nTomahawk changed that. In every military conflict where Tomahawk has led the start of hostilities, our enemy's headquarters have been first to experience the explosions of war as Tomahawks destroy their Command and Control assets.\n\nCommunications are first to go because there can be no control without them. Since our enemies tend to be totalitarian, their militaries are especially vulnerable since their tactical leadership dares not make decisions without orders.\n\nWithout central communications from their military leaders, supplies never left their stockpiles. Iraqi troops were left to huddle in the desert without direction, encouragement, or reliable re-supplies of food, water, and medicine.\n\nTomahawk's barrage made it impossible for Iraq's military command structure to recover. Not surprisingly, well over a million troops either fled or surrendered. The remaining Iraqi troops suffered huge losses.\n\nWhat did this mean for American and allied troops? You can measure it in bullets -- or rather, bullets never fired. Assuming each Iraqi soldier started with 100 rounds of ammunition, then about 100 million rounds were never fired at our troops as a result of Tomahawk's early barrages. Likewise, millions of rounds were not fired against Iraqi forces either.\n\nAmerican forces endured fewer than 150 battle-related deaths in Operation Desert Storm. Our allies suffered fewer than 100 battle-related deaths combined. It is no exaggeration to say that Tomahawk's unique capabilities saved the lives and limbs of tens of thousands of American and allied soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers.\n\nI have dedicated my post-war career to the Tomahawk project because I am dedicated to safeguarding the next generation of American soldiers. Since 1991, Tomahawk has evolved to become more precise and more adaptable, and it remains the nation's weapon of choice for first strike. It is not hard to see why.", "The news this week that The Gambia has passed a Bill that further criminalises homosexual conduct and imposes life sentences in cases of \"aggravated\" homosexuality, along with the continued coverage of the constitutional fate of similar legislation in Uganda, provides an occasion to revisit the most famous debate about the criminalisation of homosexuality in the 20th century in the West.\n\nThe debate is known in jurisprudential circles as the Hart-Devlin debate and arose out of the publication of a report (the so-called Wolfenden report) in the United Kingdom in 1957, which recommended the decriminalisation of private, consensual homosexual sexual conduct between men (sodomy).\n\nThe first salvo in the debate was delivered by Patrick Devlin - a well-known law lord and judge - in his Maccabean lecture in Jurisprudence for the British Society in 1959. The Wolfenden report recommended decriminalisation of consensual homosexuality in the United Kingdom on the basis that \"there must remain a realm of private morality and immorality which is, in brief and crude terms, not the law's business\". Against this view, Devlin relied on that dangerous and nebulous concept called \"society\" to argue that there can be no theoretical limit on the right of \"society\" to enforce morality through the criminal law. Hannah Arendt argued around the same time that the word \"society\" had become the watchword for a conformist cultural argument that \"allows for only one interest and one opinion\". Predictably then, Devlin defined society in homogeneic terms (that is to say in terms that portray a marked anxiety concerning plurality, dissent and politics) by describing it as \"a community of ideas\" and stating that \"without shared ideas on politics, morals, and ethics no society can exist\".\n\nWith this as his premise, Devlin continued that \"an established morality is as necessary as good government to the welfare of society\", that there is \"disintegration\" in a society \"when no common morality is observed\" and that consequently society is as entitled to enforce its moral code through the law as it is to protect its government with laws against sedition and treason. To quote Lord Devlin: \"The suppression of vice is as much the law's business as the suppression of subversive activities, it is no more possible to define a sphere of private morality than it is to define one of private subversive activity.\" To echo the well-known feminist slogan: in the world of Lord Devlin there was no private moral activity that was not at once at least potentially politically relevant, that did not register, at least potentially, in the public sphere and hence, fell to be the subject of policing in the broadest sense of that term.\n\nIn contradistinction to the feminist slogan that claims the personal as a basis for political emancipation, Lord Devlin claimed it as a basis for political oppression by arguing that where such private activity consisted in the practice of what \"society\" considered to be a vice, it had to be viewed as seriously and as threatening to society as an act of treason or sedition.\n\nConsequently, so ran the argument, \"society\" had every right to protect itself against such a disintegration from within and, for this reason, Devlin concluded that there can be no theoretical limits to legislation against immorality. With this, Lord Devlin made short shrift of the Wolfenden Report's assertion that \"it is not the function of the law to intervene in the private lives of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour\" other than those aimed at the preservation of public order, decency and the protection of the citizen against exploitation and injury. His argument also discounted, without more, the point of view of the report that society actually places a high importance on \"individual freedom of choice and action in matters of private morality\".\n\nIn his response to Devlin, HLA Hart - professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford - made the important point that when we consider the right of a society to protect itself, we must surely ask the question what kind of a society we are talking about and what the supposed steps to protect it, would entail. As Hart writes: \"If a society were mainly devoted to the cruel persecution of a racial or religious minority, or if the steps to be taken included hideous tortures, it is arguable that what Lord Devlin terms the \"disintegration\" of such a society would be morally better than its continued existence, and steps ought not to be taken to preserve it\". As regards laws purporting to enforce a sexual morality, Hart relied on John Stuart Mill's harm principle to argue that power in the form of criminalisation could only be \"rightfully\" exercised over people in order to prevent harm to others. Private conduct that could not be said to be harmful, could not be outlawed by the criminal law. Hart continued to argue that the law's interference with individual freedom in the context of sexuality could be regarded as inflicting a special form of suffering, since \"the difficulties involved in the repression of sexual impulses and the consequences of repression are quite different from those involved in the abstention from 'ordinary' crime\". Sexual impulses he argued, constitute a recurrent and insistent part of daily life and the threat posed by legislative prohibition \"affects the development or balance of the individual's emotional life, happiness, and personality\".\n\nIn other words, it is Hart's argument that sexual freedom goes to the heart of private life and personal freedom, that a society has an interest in the happiness and well-being of its members and that the prohibition of a practice that fundamentally concerns the emotional and physical well-being of a significant portion of the members of a society, constitutes a special instance where society's enforcement of morality is not justifiable. Lord Devlin would have it that where society judges the homosexual as a threat to its continued existence it has the right to literally render the homosexual invisible, to obliterate her from what Jacques Ranci\u00e8re calls \"the distribution of the sensible\", by banishing her to a place of isolation, loneliness, fear and threat. HLA Hart, on the other hand, would argue that society has an obligation to protect its members from exploitation and oppression by way of a re-distribution of the sensible that would include the homosexual subject as a full and equal - and thus visible - part. In the end, Hart and Devlin take fundamentally divergent views of society as a distribution of the sensible. Lord Devlin's is a totalitarian society. It consists in an attempt to subordinate all individuality to the primacy of the society as a whole, whereas Hart's is a society that I would refer to in Derrida's terms as the society of the democracy to come.\n\nLet me speak to totalitarian society first. The implication of my argument here is necessarily that I consider as totalitarian societies that persecute homosexuality, for from the point of view of the queer subject they meet the definitive criteria of such a society in that they consist in no more than a brutal deployment of the machinery of the state to liquidate the most private and intimate part of a person's or group of person's life. As regards the society of the democracy to come, Derrida's argument is that democracy everywhere is never consistent with itself, always already deferred, more or less, different from itself. Liberal democratic orders (such as South Africa) that celebrate same-sex marriage as the pinnacle of sexual liberation and democracy all too often ignore the intimidation, violence and brutality that members of sexual minorities continue to suffer at the hands of \"society\" even in an order in which the letter of the law is now unequivocally on their side. Whatever the perspective, the queer subject's struggle remains far from over. Indeed, in the overwhelming majority of African countries it has only just begun to rise to international consciousness. We are clearly still challenged to continue to resist in the name of a sexual democracy that remains elusive in varying degrees everywhere in Africa.", "It would be too much to say that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange feels optimistic. He's been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for more than two years now, with cameras and police-\"a \u00a33 million surveillance operation,\" he calls it-just meters away.\n\n\"There's a sense of inevitability now,\" Assange said when we asked if his situation might change.\n\nAssange: \"The situation is clarifying politically and legally.\"\n\nArs: \"I just want to be clear on this point-are you saying you're hopeful you'll be free soon?\"\n\nAssange: \"I wouldn't say hopeful. I would say it's inevitable. It's inevitable that we will win the diplomatic standoff we're in now.\"\n\nIt's getting late in London, where Assange is doing a barrage of press interviews on the eve his new book, When Google Met Wikileaks (it goes on sale in the US later this week). We called at the agreed upon time, and a man who didn't identify himself answered the number, which was for a London cell phone. He said call back in five minutes, and only then was the phone finally handed to Assange.\n\nWe're supposed to focus on the book. But first, we want to know what life trapped in the embassy involves-where does he eat, sleep, do laundry? What is the room he's was in now like?\n\n\"For security reasons, I can't tell you which sections of the embassy I utilise,\" he said. \"As to the rest, in a way, it's a perfectly normal situation. In another way, it's one of the most abnormal, unusual situations that someone can find themselves in.\"\n\nAssange ushered WikiLeaks through several massive leaks of secret US government reports and a tumultuous relationship with some prominent newspapers. First came the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of military reports on the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, then a leak of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the State Department.\n\nHe sought asylum from Ecuador when he was on the verge of being extradited to Sweden to face sexual-assault charges in that nation. If he leaves the embassy, he'll be arrested, although it isn't clear where he'll be sent first. It's widely assumed the US has an ongoing investigation into Assangeover the leaks.\n\nAsked about what his future outside the embassy walls might look like, he stays focused on the legal battles ahead. \"We have a lot of dominos to knock over,\" he said. \"There are three or four different legal cases going on, and technical means to obstruct the asylum.\"\n\nHe knows his travel will always be circumscribed to a degree, but Assange seems comfortable with that. He's cognisant of the parallels between his situation and that of Edward Snowden's.\n\n\"He has freedom of movement,\" Assange acknowledged. \"But his freedom of movement excludes a number of countries which can be pressured by the US, and that's also true for me.\"\n\nHis voice sounded scratchy, as he spoke to Ars about how Google, and its chairman Eric Schmidt, were at the \"centre of American power,\" pushing an \"aggressive new ideology.\" In the background, another phone started ringing. Assange wasn't distracted. Half prisoner, half professor, he kept talking in the same slow cadence, with an insistent and didactic focus on making his point.\n\nBreaking the Google Glass\n\nAssange's book is part dissertation, part self-interested reference work, and all grudge match. Most of the work is dedicated to dismantling another text: that's The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen, the head of \"Google Ideas\" and a former analyst at the State Department. The first 50 pages of Assange's book explores the role Schmidt fills in today's global power network: \"the point where the centrist, liberal, and imperialist tendencies meet in American political life.\" That long essay attacking The New Digital Age is followed by... a short essay attacking Schmidt's book, a reprint of Assange's 2013 op-ed in the New York Times entitled \"The Banality of 'Don't Be Evil.\"\n\nThe next several chapters-the bulk of Assange's book-are actually a transcript of his single meeting with Schmidt in June 2011, when Schmidt interviewed him for The New Digital Age. This heavily-footnoted section is followed by another short essay, \"Deliver us from 'Don't Be Evil,'\" in which Assange invites readers to look at how WikiLeaks was portrayed in Schmidt's book and \"compare against the source material.\"\n\nIt gives the distinct impression that Assange seems fairly obsessed with Schmidt. We asked him to explain his book's intense focus on the man.\n\n\"Schmidt and his network represent what is becoming the centre of American power,\" he said. \"This is not a group of people who, by their personalities, are necessarily bad people. But they happen to have an aggressive new ideology that is able to amass significant amounts of power-precisely because it is represented by individuals that dress themselves in a mantle of reformist rhetoric. Now it's merged with traditional forms of power, mostly based in Washington. It's the most modern form of company structure that we have.\"\n\nGoogle has doubled its market capitalisation in a few years, and \"its reach now extends to every person in one way or another,\" says Assange. It extends to the million-plus people each day who activate Android phones. They \"may not think they're using the Internet,\" but of course, they are.\n\n\"Out of my comfort zone\"\n\nAssange speaks of his book as a kind of diagram of how power works in the age of the Internet: an analysis of the \"positioning\" of Google and Schmidt, he explained. But plenty of it reads like good, old-fashioned score-settling, albeit with an academic veneer. Assange describes how he was excited to get his hands on a copy of Schmidt's book and \"had someone carry a copy past the police cordon so I could read it.\"\n\nYet Assange seems shocked that book-penned by one of Silicon Valley's wealthiest executives and the government functionary he brought into the Googleplex-isn't sufficiently revolutionary. Having smuggled a copy into the embassy that has become his prison, Assange condemns Schmidt's work as having \"failed to deliver-failed even to imagine a future, good or bad, substantially different to the present.\" He writes:\n\n\"The book was a simplistic fusion of Fukuyama \"end of history\" ideology-out of vogue since the 1990s-and faster mobile phones. It was padded out with DC shibboleths, State Department orthodoxies, and fawning grabs from Henry Kissinger. The scholarship was poor-even degenerate. It did not seem to fit the profile of Schmidt, that sharp, quiet man in my living room.\"\n\nUltimately, Assange completes his journey and grows to understand the meaning of Schmidt's visit to see him. The \"burgeoning digital superstate\" of Google \"was offering to be Washington's geopolitical visionary.\" Schmidt, in a sense, was acting-doing \"back-channel diplomacy\" for the government. \"While WikiLeaks had been deeply involved in publishing the inner archive of the US State Department, the US State Department had, in effect, snuck into the WikiLeaks command centre and hit me up for a free lunch,\" writes Assange.\n\nDespite his belief that Schmidt and Cohen were mining him for information, Assange rates their performance-and his own-as stellar:\n\n\"To their credit, I consider the interview perhaps the best I have ever given. I was out of my comfort zone and I liked it. We ate and then took a walk in the grounds, all while on the record. I asked Eric Schmidt to leak US government information requests to WikiLeaks, and he refused, suddenly nervous, citing the illegality of disclosing Patriot Act requests. And then as the evening came on it was done and they were gone, back to the unreal, remote halls of information empire, and I was left to get back to my work.\"\n\nWhen Schmidt's book published, it was met with \"only uncomprehending praise,\" Assange seethes. That's an odd thing to say, since Assange himself was invited to critique it in the best-known English language newspaper in the world. Assange's New York Times essay on the book, which he slams as a \"blueprint for technocratic imperialism, from two of its leading witch doctors,\" was likely read by at least as many people as read Schmidt's book.\n\nBut that was insufficient for Assange, so he has now published a book-length assault on Schmidt and his connections. It's a single-minded tome: an angry, erudite, unredacted letter from the world's most unusual prisoner.\n\n\"A place where politics happens\"\n\nAssange does bring up important issues. To him and his sympathisers, the erosion of privacy is making the free world look more totalitarian, not the geeky paradise envisioned by Internet utopians. But it's hard to escape the feeling that his book is essentially an extension of points he made effectively in his 2013 Times piece. The added depth feels like fist-banging, not proving points.\n\nIn a way, the intense focus on Google prevents Assange from telling his own story in a meaningful way-but that was never his intention. It's telling that Assange, having readied an autobiography together with a ghost writer, decided to spike the work after seeing a first draft. \"All memoir is prostitution,\" he declared to his publisher in 2011, seeking to cancel the contract. Months later, Canongate Books went ahead and published the \"Unauthorized Autobiography\" without his consent.\n\nFor the dedicated reader, there is information about Assange and his project in When Google Meets Wikileaks-such as Assange's changing view on how, and when, to redact leaked cables. But it's presented through the stilted view of a conversation with Schmidt.\n\nIn Assange's mind, the redactions of the leaked material made by the world's newspapers were massive, far more than what was needed. In his talk with Schmidt, he describes The Guardian removing \"two-thirds of a cable about Bulgarian crime,\" including the names of \"all the mafiosi who had infiltrated the Bulgarian government... They are worried that they might get sued for libel in London.\" The Irish Independent redacted the names of corrupt companies, \"even though it's a very good newspaper and the journalists are totally onside.\" Overall, it amounts to \"incredible self-censorship.\"\n\nAssange told Ars that WikiLeaks could have done a better job policing the media outlets he worked with. They agreed to redact only for \"human rights reasons,\" he said, but ultimately \"they redacted for political reasons\" as well.\n\nAssange describes WikiLeaks' role as a role of historical one, but it's hardly complete. One doesn't have to look any further than today's headlines about the FinFisher leak to see that the site is still making news.\n\n\"WikiLeaks has performed an important role in demonstrating what can be done, and the technology to do it,\" he said. \"That's caused others to emulate some of our methods.\n\n\"Most importantly, all of this has inspired other whistleblowers to come forward in different ways. It's inspired people to believe that the Internet is a place where politics happens. Politics in the sense of, being a place where society is shaped. I think if you go back five years, the Internet was an apolitical space.\"\n\nTo close, we asked him about geography. He didn't see much irony in the fact that advocates for transparency and liberalism, like himself and Edward Snowden, have ultimately found protection from regimes that aren't very liberal.\n\n\"Well, Ecuador wasn't thought of as anything until it gave me asylum-then there was a campaign to describe it as illiberal,\" he said. \"Asylum is a serious business. People seeking political asylum, by definition, are doing so to avoid persecution. They go to the country most likely to protect them from that persecution, out of the countries that feel strong enough, or independent enough, to do so.\n\n\"Edward Snowden and I, and some others who didn't manage to get out, have become Western political dissidents. There is a power alliance through the major institutions of the West-that's why they call it the West. So it's only going to be non-Western countries that are able to offer asylum.\"", "A federal judge on Tuesday gave another black eye to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, issuing a scathing rebuke of the agency's handling of the career and security of one of its own -- celebrated undercover agent Jay Dobyns, who infiltrated the notorious Hells Angels.\n\nAfter a costly six-year legal battle, Judge Francis Allegra, with the federal claims court in Washington, D.C., chastised the ATF for failing to adequately protect Dobyns and his family from the gang.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe motorcycle gang had sought retribution after the agent's undercover work during Operation Black Biscuit, which brought 16 indictments against them including charges of murder and racketeering.\n\nThreats against Dobyns included threats to kill him and his family, gang-rape his wife, and infect Dobyns with the HIV virus.\n\nDobyns' house also was burned down in 2008 with his wife and children sleeping inside. In the case, Dobyns said the ATF accused him of starting the fire. The arsonist was never caught.\n\n\"It is evident that ATF officials failed to follow through in implementing the steps that were supposed to minimize the risks that might affect Agent Dobyns and his family. In the court's view, this represented another instance in which ATF violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\" Allegra wrote in his opinion.\n\nA 2007 settlement, reached after Dobyns first claimed the agency improperly investigated and protected his family against threats, awarded him $373,000.\n\nBut Dobyns alleged a \"breach of good faith,\" claiming the agency continued to retaliate against him. Allegra, in his opinion, awarded Dobyns $173,000 in damages.\n\nDobyns, who is currently out of the country at a motivational speaking event, posted a lengthy statement on his website claiming vindication.\n\n\"This was never about a cash-out to leverage me into silence. This always was, has been, and will continue to be about the restoration of dignity that the federal government stole from me,\" he wrote.\n\nAsked for comment on Tuesday, a Justice Department official told Fox News: \"We have received and are reviewing the Court's decision. We have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nThe ATF managers involved in the case happen to be the same senior officials in Arizona who mishandled the Operation Fast and Furious case -- the botched anti-gunrunning sting -- including Agent in Charge Bill Newell and his assistant George Gillett.\n\nThe opinion said Gillett and another agent \"purposely slowed\" the probe into Dobyns' house fire and said despite Gillett's claims that he did not view Dobyns as a suspect, \"every indication was that he did.\" The judge also said \"there is strong indication\" that Gillett at least \"tacitly approved\" of a decision to tape-record conversations with Dobyns in 2008 without his knowledge.\n\nAllegra wrote that \"it appears that ASAC Gillett purposely attempted to shield critical investigative information from senior ATF officials and did so, knowing full well that he was not complying with the procedures used for filing information.\"\n\nAllegra likened the case to the Franz Kafka novel, \"The Trial,\" where \"Kafka depicts a totalitarian state in which the government suppressed freedom via a deluge of circuitous and irrational process,\" including acquittals that don't really remove the threat of legal charges.\n\n\"Experiences like these unfortunately bring to mind those that Agent Dobyns experienced,\" he wrote. \"A time that should have been one of healing and reconciliation, but that instead gave certain ATF officials and agents the opportunity to harm Agent Dobyns further. In the court's view, the actions of these ATF employees indisputably breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. ... Hopefully, this will bring this Kafkaesque story to an end.\"\n\nDobyns recently retired from the agency with his badge and full pension and is now on the speaking circuit.\n\nOther agents expressed disappointment with Tuesday's decision and said the relatively modest award will discourage whistleblowers and wronged agents from coming forward with information about the agency.\n\nDobyns, a decorated agent, best-selling author and former star football player at the University of Arizona, joined ATF out of college. During his first week on the job at age 26, Dobyns was shot. He fell in love with undercover work, and was asked to infiltrate the Hells Angels.\n\nShaving his head, getting \"fully sleeved\" with tattoos shoulder to wrist, bulking up and essentially leaving his family behind, Dobyns became Jay \"Bird\" Davis, a chain smoking, Harley-riding renegade.\n\nDobyns was invited to join the gang only after \"killing\" the leader of a rival gang, the Mongols. In fact, the shooting death was staged, complete with a Hollywood make-up artist and a dead cow used to splatter the victims' clothing with blood and brain matter.\n\nAllegra, in his decision, also denied government claims for royalties from Dobyns' book.\n\nWilliam La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based correspondent.", "A Palestinian waves a Hamas flag (R) as others celebrate following a ceasefire in Gaza City August 26, 2014 (Reuters / Suhaib Salem)\n\nEretz Israel is not an empty country ... On no account must we injure the rights of the inhabitants. Only \"Ghetto Dreamers\" ... can imagine that Eretz Israel will be given to the Jews with the added right of dispossessing the current inhabitants of the country. This is not the mission of Zionism. Had Zionism to aspire to inherit the place of these inhabitants -- it would be nothing but a dangerous utopia and an empty, damaging and reactionary dream ...\n\nDavid Ben-Gurion, 1918.\n\nThe father of his country wrote these words early on in the project of Israel -- still in its dreamy, pre-natal state -- responding to the hardline mitteleuropa sensibility of conquest, which had overtaken the rhetoric of his fellow Zionists. Years later, in the 1930's, he would still speak of the fraternal kinship between his Arab \"neighbours\" and \"brethren,\" and the Jews, and their common destiny. But decades of conflict, and the pressures of a public life, would erode his idea of comity with the Arabs, and he ended up an enthusiastic supporter of the settler movement. A case of \"as goes the Man, so goes the Nation,\" you might say.\n\nToday, that \"reactionary dream\" is fully upon us, and Israel's political establishment is seduced by dangerous utopianism -- the logical outcome, perhaps, of a nation founded in dispossession, now at the limits of what it can achieve by force.\n\nThe time is long past to ask, \"What does Israel want?\" We don't need utopian answers from millenarians believing in divine right -- no prophetic rhetoric, thank you, from a pre-modern twilight of gods and covenants. Rather, we need practical, 21st Century answers. If Israel wants the Palestinians to vanish -- some quickly, others dispossessed in slow motion increments over years -- then let her say that to the world. This month's seizure of 1,000 acres of West Bank Palestinian land by the state -- intended to link settler blocs in a chain to Israel -- echoes another of Ben-Gurion's famous pronouncements, \"It doesn't matter what the goyim say, but what the Jews do.\"\n\nQuite so -- amid the vast wreckage of another pointless campaign against the captive Gazans, and the resulting international condemnation by, well, the goyim, we Jews just keep doing what we have done since 1948: destroying the Palestinians. A fifty-day operation -- shooting fish in a barrel, as we say here in the 'States -- leaves 2,100 dead, over 500 of them children; 10,000 injured; as many as 300,000 displaced, and perhaps some 60,000 Gazans now permanently homeless. As the school year begins for a quarter-million Gaza students, dozens of school buildings lie in ruins, or double as shelters for displaced families. The economic and industrial output of the Strip is reduced to ashes; hospitals, mosques and apartment towers are destroyed; vital infrastructure for an at-risk population is shattered. This is what we Jews do, apparently, with regularity.\n\nAre we to believe all this was over the ineffectual, largely symbolic rocket fire? And what of 2009? And 2012? The pattern suggests otherwise -- no matter how much Israel \"explains\" each of its attacks as \"responsive\" to this or that, the strategic agenda remains consistent since 1967: the ghettoizing of Gaza and its unruly residents, while the West Bank is slowly digested. It enforces and continues the dispossession from the founding of the state, and cannot be viewed in isolation or out of context.\n\nIt's fashionable in the West to ask why the Palestinians don't just stay down on the canvas, and save themselves a beating -- polite discourse shakes its head at the sight of a fighter who doesn't know when he's lost, and tactfully looks away. Yet Israel's periodic poundings confirm that they are not beaten -- the very fact of continued resistance is an affront to Israel's totalitarian control, and the Gazans fight back anyway they can, out-gunned and bloodied.\n\nThe disproportionality of the destruction visited on Gaza -- which some estimate may take ten years and many billions of dollars to repair -- signals a new moral low for Israel in its biennial bloodletting. This was about much more than rockets -- it says, through the lesson of brute force, the ghetto will be pacified. Sound familiar? Israel's military campaign against a mostly defenseless, urbanized population is a continuation of removal by other means. Its total war on the material facts of Palestinian life -- physical, civil, generational -- is meant to reduce any hope of statehood likewise to rubble. The message to the world is, \"watch what we Jews do.\"\n\nBut what do the Palestinians want, in practical terms? The answer is easy: they want what other people want -- to live free, with self-determination, and respect. As a 21 year old college student in Gaza -- who has just survived her third bombardment and invasion, losing her home -- tells me, \"I'm not Fatah or Hamas, but I support the resistance, because at least we have our dignity.\"\n\nFirst and foremost, the Palestinians want an immediate end to the blockade of Gaza: no more closed borders by Egypt and Israel; no more denial of the land, sea and air. Gaza shall have an airport, a seaport and land crossings; the West Bank will have freedom of movement and open crossings with Jordan. The Palestinians will compete in the global marketplace. This fundamental right is not subject to negotiation. Israel may have her reasonable assurances about what constitutes free traffic and trade, but the blockade must end. Hamas has recently agreed to the Palestinian Authority's sole control of crossings -- and Israel will, one day, sit down and work this out with PA representatives who are from the resistance group. Why pretend otherwise?\n\nThere will be no disarmament of the Palestinians -- they have a right to maintain self-defense forces like any other people. When every two years, your neighbor kills some 2,000 of your citizens, why on earth would you agree to disarmament? Instead of insisting on the impractical, perhaps Israel should focus on fostering an environment in which the gun is no longer reached for, but one in which justice replaces conflict.\n\nThe settlements must be removed, under terms and conditions to be negotiated in the future. Every acre, every dunam, every olive tree alienated by housing code, administrative law, military occupation -- whatever elegant ruse Israel chooses to cloak its thievery -- must end today. Settlements are illegal. Israel's leaders made this monster -- let them dismantle it. Ultimately, there is no other way to peace.\n\nFinally, Israel should accept a long-term hudna, or cease-fire, if the resistance groups offer it -- ten years of a \"time out\" might permit the breathing room needed for a new generation of Israelis to push aside her obdurate, reactionary leadership, clear the ideological dead-wood, and let light in on a dark land; while likewise permitting a new generation of Palestinian leaders to determine perhaps not what it wants, but what it needs. Should Israel end the blockade, commit to self-determination for the Palestinians, and non-interference in their affairs, a decade without violence could be secured for both sides. No one can guarantee an end to all inter-communal violence -- be it a Baruch Goldstein, or a West Bank teenager bent on vengeance. But the institutionalization of violence -- Israel's policy objective of \"mowing the lawn,\" for example -- must end. Hamas has guaranteed other lengthy periods of relative stability, during which violence was all but eliminated, and it can do so again, provided Israel has the courage to recognize fundamental Palestinian rights. As another Baruch -- the Jewish philosopher Spinoza -- once famously wrote, \"There can be no hope without fear.\"\n\nIt would appear to almost all observers that the two-state solution has one foot in the grave. Only the complete removal of the IDF and all settlers from the West Bank might revive it. Anything short of that points the way toward a single state -- maybe not next year, but someday. Extremist ideology, colonial ambition and outright racism is ascendant in Israel, at the precise moment when realism needs to prevail. \"Fortress Israel\" cannot survive in a permanent combat stance, against its neighbors and brethren, the Palestinians.\n\nIt is true that the long-term hudna would leave key issues unresolved. It is not meant to address final borders, the right of return, or other core disputes. A hudna is not meant to tackle \"recognition\" or compel a change in Hamas' charter. Yet it makes a necessary first step towards d\u00e9tente -- to use an old word from the Cold War: another seemingly intractable conflict between two enemies vowing mutual destruction which, in the end, turned out to be unrealistic.", "A daily roundup of terrorism and security issues.\n\nThe Obama administration has threatened to destroy the Syrian government's air defenses if US warplanes flying missions to attack militants in Syria are targeted over the country's air space.\n\nThe public threat is an example of the difficult waters Mr. Obama is wading into with his plan to \"destroy\" the self-styled Islamic State, which is fighting to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The White House insists that its effort will neither help Mr. Assad nor involve his cooperation, more than three years into Syria's civil war.\n\nSyrian war-planes and helicopters are already flying missions against IS and other rebel groups, and without coordination between Syrian and US forces, the risk of accidental engagements is high.\n\nThe Associated Press reports:\n\nOfficials said the U.S. has a good sense of where the Syrian air defenses, along with their command and control centers, are located. If Assad were to use those capabilities to threaten U.S. forces, it would put his air defenses at risk, according to the officials, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the administration's thinking on the matter.\n\n... U.S. officials have ruled out direct coordination with Assad and insist that a campaign against the Islamic State will not strengthen the Syrian dictator's hold on power.\n\nThe New York Times reports that House Republicans are planning to use a vote on authorizing training for Syrian rebels to push Obama for more clarity on his strategy for confronting IS. Some lawmakers are uneasy at the prospect that US-trained rebels may defect with their weapons to IS.\n\nHouse leaders want to leave an imprint on the ISIS bill. The amendment, as redrafted by the House Armed Services Committee, will require the Obama administration, 15 days before the program begins, to report to Congress how the training and equipping of Syrian rebels fits with a broader strategy to defeat ISIS, how the military plans to vet participants and how officers plan to stop the kinds of attacks by pupils on U.S. forces that have plagued training efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nThe bill also mandates that every 90 days, the administration will update Congress on the program's performance, how many trainees might have gone over to ISIS and how trainees are using U.S. military equipment.\n\nIn recent weeks, Obama and officials in his administration have spoken of IS as a great evil that the US is now committed to utterly eradicating. Such bold declarations have provoked skepticism, given that precisely that sort of language has been deployed against Al Qaeda and the Taliban by US officials since 2001, without the promised result.\n\nMichael Tomasky writes for The Daily Beast that the tough, declarative language is a mistake.\n\nHere's something we're not going to do, and I wish Obama and especially John Kerry would stop saying it. We are not going to \"destroy\" ISIS, to use the word Obama deployed in last week's address (preceded by a marginally softening \"ultimately\"). The Islamic State will not be \"crushed,\" as John Kerry huffily put it in a recent tweet. This is not possible. We all know this. We've been trying to destroy al Qaeda for 13 years now. We have not. We will not. And we will not destroy ISIS. We can't destroy these outfits. They're too nimble and slippery and amorphous, and everybody knows it.\n\nSo why say it? Why not say what we hopefully can do and what we should do: contain it. We have contained al Qaeda. Some of the methods have been morally problematic (drone strikes that sometimes kill innocents, etc.), but the methods have worked. Al Qaeda, say the experts, is now probably not in a position to pull off a 9/11. Containment is fine. It does the job.\n\nBut no, I guess a president can't say that. A president has to sound like John Wayne. It's depressing and appalling. If he doesn't go cowboy on us, the war hawks will call him a weakling, say he is unfit and unprepared -- and in Obama's case, they will surely add that he is unwilling -- to defend \"the homeland,\" this phrase we're all now supposed to use that carries a slightly totalitarian odor about it.\n\nMeanwhile, both US and French warplanes are now flying over Iraq, in support of Baghdad's efforts to defeat IS, which now controls the northern city of Mosul and many of the towns to the south of there along the Tigris River. But Iraq remains fertile ground for the group's recruiters: Large sections of the country's Sunni Arab minority feel they're more at risk from the state's Shiite-dominated security services than the jihadis.\n\nScott Peterson writes for the Monitor about how one Iraqi Sunni was pushed toward supporting the rebellion.\n\nMohamed Abu Abed's account of suffering at the hands of Iraq's Shiite-dominated security forces and government over the years echoes repeatedly among Iraq's minority Sunnis, who once held the reins of power in Iraq under Saddam Hussein but have been pushed aside and often targeted since the 2003 American invasion.\n\n... Abu Abed's father and brother were killed by Shiite militiamen, for example, during a period of severe sectarian bloodletting in September 2006. Both truck drivers, they were stopped at illegal Mahdi Army checkpoints, and their bodies were at the morgue the next day with bullet holes to the head. Abu Abed says he narrowly escaped the same fate.\n\nThen in late 2006 Abu Abed was picked up with 34 others in a sweep by Iraqi military units of his neighborhood in Abu Ghraib, which along with nearby Fallujah was the heart of a Sunni and Al Qaeda insurgency that battled American and Iraqi forces.\n\nThe military found nothing incriminating at Abu Abed's house but took him away anyway, he says. He was beaten hard the first day, accused of being an insurgent but never charged, and held for 2-1/2 years. Inside prison, he says, he heard the screams of those being tortured, and just as often heard the vows of Sunni detainees that, once out, they would join the insurgency and exact revenge.\n\nTorture has been widespread in Iraqi detention facilities since Saddam Hussein was toppled, much as it was while he was in power.

And he was there for a while. We did a couple of shows together. And that's, I guess, the beginning of that part of my story. This was a one occasion: once that we had sex, that I got pregnant.

It was a terrible, terrible thing for a single girl to get pregnant. You were looked down on as if you were a third-class citizen and you were a bad girl, a wanton girl. I'd read in a magazine that there was an unmarried mothers' home in Sydney so I arranged to go up on the train. So he put me on the train and stood there while the train left. I always hoped that he would say, \"Don't go.\" I didn't want anything to happen to my baby. But he didn't.\n\nROBYN BISHOP, PLAYWRIGHT AND FRIEND: He promised to write to her and when the baby was given away for adoption that they could get back together again, just like before, and forget about it.\n\nJAN RUSS: I'd never been to Sydney before, Central Station. And I remember getting off the train, terrified, not knowing what to do. I knew I had to ring the unmarried mothers' home. They said, \"We're full. We can't take you in.\" And they said, \"Go to the YWCA and stay there overnight and call us the next morning.\" And I can remember going into this dark building and the room I had.\n\nROBYN BISHOP, PLAYWRIGHT AND FRIEND: She considered throwing herself out the window and ending it all so that she wouldn't cause trouble to her parents, to her boyfriend, to anybody else. But she actually felt the baby move in her stomach and she couldn't commit suicide. She couldn't go that way. She had to get on with it and have the child.\n\nJAN RUSS: Next morning I went straight and rang again to the unmarried mothers' home and they said, \"Oh there's this lady who can take you in.\"\n\n(Footage of Jan walking in Edgecliff, Sydney)\n\nTESSA DURSTON: They rang to say that another girl had arrived from Victoria and would I go and just see how she is?

She was a fun person and she cared about them and we were just all part of the family, as I still consider that she is now.\n\nJAN RUSS: I had to help her around the house with the kids and different things. And they gave me a lot of care and love. I felt, I felt... good there.\n\nTESSA DURSTON: I remember she'd be looking for a letter from Melbourne, you know. \"Was there any letters for me today?\" That was another thing that stands out when you look back at it. I did ask her if her mother knew and she said, \"Oh, no.\"\n\nJAN RUSS: I didn't tell anyone. Only him. Not a soul. I wrote to my parents all sorts of stories. I didn't want to sort of tell too many lies to them, but they felt I was having a holiday and doing a little bit of work.\n\n(Excerpt from 'The Unmarried Mother', ABC TV, 1965)\n\nWILFRED JARVIS, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST, UNI.

Do you think you're going to regret it later?\n\nMOTHER-TO-BE: Oh, I hope not, anyhow.\n\n(Excerpt ends)\n\nJAN RUSS: I remember that Tess talking to me about having the baby adopted and that it would be very hard for me to cope on my own and that, you know: how would you get work? And that she had friends who really wanted to adopt a baby and they were really lovely people.\n\nTESSA DURSTON: I had this friend whose sister had adopted two children and was looking, hopeful of another child. I just asked her how that could work out and they said they would be very happy to consider it and they would arrange the legalities.\n\nJAN RUSS: The day of the birth, I remember scrubbing the floor at Tess's house, giving it a scrub and I suddenly felt release. So I called out to Tess and I said, \"Look, I think something's happening.\"\n\nTESSA DURSTON: We got over to the hospital and I thought, because of my nursing background, that I would've been allowed in. But I was asked to leave immediately; that they would take care of her. And I can remember leaving that place, feeling desolate.\n\nJAN RUSS: I was taken to this ward, right down the end of the hospital. And you passed all these other wards of the married mothers, you know, all prettily painted in soft colours. We went down to the end of this corridor to this dreary, old room and these terrible old beds I'm sure they got out of the army. There were probably about five or six of us unmarried girls. You know, I'm in pain. I'm on my own. I'm scared. I'm frightened. I think I'm dying and I'm screaming because I didn't know what else to do and I just wanted someone to come and give me a bit of help. And I can remember this sister, very officious sister, just coming in and ripping - not the side curtain, the front curtain back and saying, \"Just shut up.\" And, \"You're making too much noise. Just shut up. There's a woman in the next cubicle with her husband and she's trying to have a baby. Just shut up!\" And I thought to myself: but I'm having a baby too. You know, what's the difference? And I'll never forget the doctor saying to the nurses, \"Let her rip. She's just one of those girls. Don't worry about it.\"\n\n(Excerpt from Four Corners, 1970)\n\nREPORTER: To single mothers, the birth of a baby becomes the moment of truth: when all her natural emotions conflict with pangs of doubt, loneliness, fear, guilt and the practical problems confronting her. It is from this moment of reality that she must fully face a decision which she may later regret: whether to keep her baby or offer it for adoption.\n\n(End of excerpt)\n\nJAN RUSS: I just yelled out to them you know, \"What is my baby? Is it a boy or a girl? What's my baby?\" And they just said, \"It's a girl\" and had just taken her. And a glimpse and that was all I saw. And then they just sort of sewed me up. No words of sympathy, encouragement, \"Are you okay?\"; nothing like that.\n\nTESSA DURSTON: You know that it's wrong but society are telling you that you don't have any rights to feel like this or to... It's a case of, um, \"Just get over it.\"\n\nJAN RUSS: There was an older nun that came in and she said, \"Do you think you should call your mother?\" And I thought, What can I say? And I rang my mother and all I said was, \"I need you.\" I didn't say anything else. That was it. I couldn't say anything else. They were the only words I could get out.\n\nTESSA DURSTON: And her mother came and I went to the hospital with her. Her mother at the time, I think, also was in quite a state of shock.\n\nJAN RUSS: And I called out \"Mum!\" and, you know, she came over and hugged me and said you know, \"Everything will be okay.\" And then she said, \"We'll go and see the baby now.\" And so I held her and had that amazing bond. They wouldn't let me breastfeed her but they let me feed her with a bottle. And then Mum said, \"We're going home.\" 'Cause Dad had written a letter saying, \"I want my three girls home.\"\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: In September 1965 we got a call from my mother saying that Jan's coming home, she's bringing a baby with her and she'd like them to come and stop at our place overnight. We had no knowledge that she was, what she was doing in Sydney. And when they phoned up about that and they said she's coming home with a baby, the shock was quite real. But then we started to think, \"Why were they coming to our place?\"\n\nDILLAS RUSS, SISTER-IN-LAW: We thought they would have gone to their house and we would have gone down to see Jan and the baby. And then, of course, what followed was just: we were just absolutely shocked.\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: We didn't have any children at that time. We would like to have had a family and we'd been married for six years up to this particular point. And I thought that maybe they were bringing the baby along for us to have a look at and say that we'd take the baby.\n\nDILLAS RUSS, SISTER-IN-LAW: I don't remember them actually saying, \"Will you take the baby?\", but it was just so obvious that they wanted to leave her with us. And I mean, we weren't even really sure at that stage what they meant by leaving her with us: whether they wanted us to adopt her or just look after her or, or what?\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: Unbeknownst to them, we were actually going through a fertility program. And we hadn't told people that and we thought at that stage that Dillas was in fact pregnant.\n\nDILLAS RUSS, SISTER-IN-LAW: I wanted to help but I felt, if I did and I was pregnant, what would I do with the two babies?\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: Suddenly I've got an airline ticket and they've said, \"Will you take the baby back to Sydney?\" And I sort of, well, what else could I say? And so I had to take the baby back.\n\nJAN RUSS: And, of course, I had no choice. I was never asked my opinion, because that's the way things were back then. You never questioned your parents. You know, \"Do you want your child to go to school and be called a 'bastard'? How would you feel if your child's getting called a 'bastard'?\" \"If you really, really loved your child, if you really loved your baby, you would, you would make sure it grew up in a good, safe home which you can't give your child.\" So I had to spend the night there with my baby daughter. I held her all night and cried and I told her that I loved her so much and that I'd always, always love her, no matter what. I just felt my whole life had just been ripped apart.\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: Next thing, I'm on the aeroplane, carrying this baby in a white shawl: this beautiful young baby. And halfway through the journey I started to cry, you know, thinking, \"What's the future of this little baby? What's happening to this little baby?\"\n\nTESSA DURSTON: My lifelong - the legacy that was left to me is this lovely young man with tears streaming down his face, handing me this beautiful little baby. And to me: I know that I went home and cried many tears for Jan that night.\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: I just felt so uneasy about the whole thing. And I just give her a kiss on the forehead and I said to her, whispered in her ear, I said: \"I hope I'll see you again one day, my sweetheart\" and just handed her over.\n\nTESSA DURSTON: And then this little girl was taken into this loving family, to me a happy family. There was a lot of care all round and she was very precious to the family that she lived with.\n\nJAN RUSS: This is the letter that my mother brought to me, that my father had written when she came up to see me in Sydney: \"Dear Jan and Mum, This is not the end of the world. It feels like life is just starting. I am waiting to welcome you both - the three of you - home with open arms.\" It sort of goes on. It's written on this bit of paper that he ripped out of a diary because he obviously, he said he's done it in a hurry. The last bit says: \"And please hurry home. Your loving Father.\"\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: I was absolutely staggered when Jan showed this letter that said he would welcome the three of them home, because it was just our father that caused the problem, as far as I'm concerned. All the rest of the family would have accepted what had happened.\n\nDILLAS RUSS, SISTER-IN-LAW: I just say, in the finish, we just convinced each other that that was all we could have done and we've just got to get on with our lives and try and forget. But you don't. I actually wasn't pregnant but I did fall pregnant the very next month and Joanne was born ten months after the little baby, so she's, there's only ten months' difference between them.\n\nJAN RUSS: And so I just sort of didn't do anything for a few months. My parents told the family that I had pneumonia and that's why I was not well. And then I still loved my musical theatre.\n\n(Music: Consider Yourself from 'Oliver' by Lionel Bart)\n\nJAN RUSS: I'd only ever done amateur work before and I thought, well, I'll just have a go at professional theatre. So I went along for an audition for a show called 'Oliver'. Two days later I got a phone call saying, \"You've got the job.\"\n\nCAROLYN KENNETT, FRIEND: Jan and I met when we were both in the chorus. Everybody was excited. It was a wonderful cast and it was a cast where a lot of friendships were formed that have endured right to today, really.\n\nJAN RUSS: We sort of paired up together. We were two blondes, so we used to do each other's hair. And we were both young and green and terribly excited. This was our first show. And so we used to flat together whenever we toured.\n\n(Footage of Jan singing 'Good Old Bad Old Days' by Anthony Newley)\n\nJAN RUSS: We're living on time we're having to borrow/No one knows if we will live to see tomorrow...\n\n(End of footage)\n\nJAN RUSS: I guess that I became a bit of a good-time party girl, enjoyed drinking and partying, just to escape the pain.\n\nCAROLYN KENNETT: I didn't know a lot about her past life. I don't think there were any clues to what had gone on before that she didn't want to reveal.\n\nJAN RUSS: I toured New Zealand with most of the shows I was in, with Oliver and Charlie Girl and Godspell. I worked with Johnny Farnham in Charlie Girl.\n\nCAROLYN KENNETT: When Jan went off to New Zealand to work: that was where I started to hear about Bruce.\n\nJAN RUSS: During Godspell is when I met my husband. He was a Kiwi. He wasn't in the theatre at all.\n\nBOB RUSS, BROTHER: Bruce came into the family and he was quite a jovial sort of a character. And then going on and having Sam, her own son, and Jan was just over the moon.\n\nJAN RUSS: It was a very mixed emotion when my son was born. I was so thrilled to have him, but the whole time at the back of my mind, all the time, was the birth of my daughter. One experience was so bad. And the other one: I had become a married woman. I had everything. I had support, which gave it a whole different sense altogether.\n\nROBYN BISHOP, PLAYWRIGHT AND FRIEND: Jan always felt with her husband that there was some dark attraction that they had. They both had secrets and, ah, that's how they bonded: over their dark secrets. And eventually Jan found out that her husband actually was gay and needed to go off and leave her and live the life he was meant to lead.\n\nJAN RUSS: And from then on I was, that was a really hard time because I became a single mother.\n\nROBYN BISHOP, PLAYWRIGHT AND FRIEND: So Jan's self-esteem took a battering when her husband left her with her little boy, Sam. And she felt, once again felt worthless and needing to prove herself.\n\n(Footage of Jan on television, singing as part of trio)\n\nROBYN BISHOP, PLAYWRIGHT AND FRIEND: Jan found her way into film and television after this had happened and was actually on-screen for several programs and then found her way back behind the screen as a casting agent.\n\nSAM HAMMINGTON, SON: She gave up everything for me. I think she still had an aspiration to tread the boards, whether it was television, film or theatre. But she realised that if you're an actor, you're out of work a lot of the time and being able to support a child is near impossible.\n\n(Footage: 'Neighbours' opening titles)\n\nBARRY CROCKER (singing): Neighbours/Everybody needs good neighbours...\n\nCAROLYN KENNETT: And then we know the story of how she took on the role of casting 'Neighbours'. Who would have known how big that was going to get?\n\n(Preview of next week's program)\n\nDANIEL MACPHERSON, ACTOR: I was 17. I'd never acted before. I didn't know what the heck I was doing and somehow I ended up on TV.\n\nJASON DONOVAN, ACTOR: You can't buy the chemistry that that combination of people can give out. It goes back to the casting.\n\nDANIEL MACPHERSON, ACTOR: Some of the most recognizable faces on Australian television wouldn't have been there without Jan.\n\nIAN SMITH, ACTOR: I can remember when she revealed what had happened. It was like the dam wall had broken.\n\nJAN RUSS: Of all the sadness and downtimes that I've had, I mean, there are... you know, I've had my son.\n\nSAM HAMMINGTON, SON: At the moment I'm on one of the highest-rating TV shows in Korea.\n\nANNOUNCER (Korean TV): This Australian broadcaster is more Korean than any other Korean guy.\n\nSAM HAMMINGTON, SON: When suddenly we get out of the van and there's three more cameras there.\n\nTESSA DURSTON: He's such a mega-star. It's unbelievable.\n\nJAN RUSS: He was married last October. I felt like I was on a Baz Luhrmann movie set, actually.\n\nSAM HAMMINGTON, SON: We were in a car and Mum said, \"I've got something to tell you\": that I've got a half-sister. I didn't want to have a part of her. I didn't know who she was and I didn't care. You know, there was jealousy there as well.\n\nIAN SMITH: And then one day, she came to me and she said, \"She's going to meet me.\" And oh...", "After the shock of Islamic State's (IS) land-grab in Iraq, horrifying videos of hostage beheadings and the public debates about possible terrorist attacks at home and military action abroad, it is unsurprising that people are worried.\n\nCollectively, these factors have made the threat of IS appear greater and the situation more pessimistic than it is.\n\nOf course, IS should be taken seriously and stopped, but the situation is more positive than many think.\n\nIS is not just militarily weaker than it appears, but also its ideology has received a potentially fatal wound.\n\nSo far, the group's strategy has not been to directly attack the West - unlike al-Qaeda, which struck at the heart of the US 13 years ago.\n\nThe US counter-terrorism response to al-Qaeda's threat, involving mostly drone strikes and special operations, decapitated almost all of its leadership and most of its core operatives.\n\nOver the last seven years or so, al-Qaeda has been reduced by the US from an organisation able to carry out global attacks to one producing out-of-date internet propaganda.\n\nSo, it is important to draw confidence from the fact that a movement that directly threatened the West systematically lost its capacity to do harm.\n\nIS vowed allegiance to al-Qaeda's leadership and ideology from the outset.\n\nMugging operations against other rebel groups in Syria, including the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, increased its strength while exposing its ruthless totalitarian nature - an inability to reach an accommodation with even those that shared its worldview.\n\nIn Iraq, IS achieved what al-Qaeda failed to: territorial control and a self-declared state.\n\nThe failure of al-Qaeda to deliver the success it promised allowed IS to feel justified in usurping its erstwhile masters.\n\nThe resulting hubris led its commander to declare himself a caliph, offending many al-Qaeda, Taliban and other jihadist groups who felt that their leaders were more theologically qualified for the title.\n\nIn doing so, IS has exposed the ultimate trajectory of al-Qaeda's theology. Just as al-Qaeda linked salvation to violence, IS has claimed spiritual supremacy through territorial expansion.\n\nThe virulent hostility between the two groups is not over theology but over power and control.\n\nPower lust has virtually broken the already tenuous link between their ideology and religion.\n\nThe bulk of Islamic teachings, which relate to mankind's understanding of the beauty of the Creator and of creation, have been eclipsed by a singular bloodlust for power.\n\nThe acquisition of religious \"authority\" through violent territorial control discredits both sides and exposes the fallacy of their myth of brotherhood and a united Ummah (community of believers).\n\nThe territorial gains of IS were not so much due to its strength as to the spectacular failure of the Iraqi army to stand and fight.\n\nIts Shia-phobic stance found ready recruits among the disenfranchised and abused Sunni tribesmen and ex-Baathists, many of whom found it a convenient spearhead for their revolt against a divisive government.\n\nIS boasts of about three months ago that it would capture Baghdad in days did not come true. Instead, some of its gains have been reversed.\n\nA few weeks ago, it lost the strategically important Mosul Dam to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters supported by US air power.\n\nDesperate to deter the US from continuing to carry out air strikes, IS beheaded James Foley just 48 hours later.\n\nIt was a bad decision. The US' most reluctant commander-in-chief was forced to respond.\n\nLike al-Qaeda, the leadership of IS had signed its own death warrant with the blood of the US citizens it murdered.\n\nOn 10 September, President Barack Obama outlined the US strategy to \"degrade and destroy\" IS.\n\nIts demise will not be quick or easy, but it is inevitable if done without creating new grievances and new ungoverned spaces.\n\nOnce under pressure from ground troops and air strikes, IS fighters are likely to melt into urban areas where pursuit will risk civilian casualties.\n\nIt is hugely important that both air and ground forces show restraint in those circumstances. Innocent civilian casualties will only create the grievances that sustain these extremists.\n\nCarefully controlled limited operations should allow IS to be cleared from towns and villages progressively over a period of months without unnecessarily risking innocent lives.\n\nHowever, the decision to simultaneously strengthen opposition to the Assad regime in Syria as part of the new strategy could delay the destruction of IS.\n\nOnly a few opposition groups will pass US vetting and may concentrate on IS, but others will continue to fight the government and each other for control of territory. The ensuing chaos could create more ungovernable space for IS to exploit.\n\nIf these twin objectives of the strategy are phased, then there is a good hope of success.\n\nJust as with al-Qaeda, military attrition will contain the IS threat but not directly kill its ideology.\n\nIndirectly, loss of territory, decapitation of leadership and ruthless in-fighting will demoralise its followers.\n\nIt will deal a severe blow to the notion that its caliphate has divine support, discrediting the modern jihadist idea that political success can be achieved through unrestrained violence devoid of human compassion.", "SummaryA task force appointed by the Telangana government on police reforms...\n\nA task force appointed by the Telangana government on police reforms has recommended 33 per cent reservation for women in police recruitment upto sub-inspector level, a senior police official said today.\n\nThe committee also recommended that every police station in the state should have a woman receptionist, besides a counsellor, Telangana Director General of Police Anurag Sharma said.\n\nThe recommendations suggested by the task force, that was formed earlier on the reforms, will be made available to public for suggestions and comments, he said.\n\n\"Women police strength has to be increased to tackle women issues. The task force has recommended 33 per cent reservation for women in civil police and 10 per cent for Armed police upto SI level,\" Sharma told reporters.\n\nWomen police personnel constitute between 8 and 9 per cent of the total state police, he said.\n\nThe department will closely work with other departments, such as women's welfare, in addressing issues related to them, he said.\n\nAdmitting that the conviction rate is low in the state, he said the department is also mulling to appoint legal advisors for every police station to assist the local officials in preparing legal documents, such as case dairy and charge sheets.\n\nThe recommendations of the task force will be available for comments and suggestion from the public through social networking sites and emails also, Sharma added.", "The museum, which will be constructed in the old railway, will be \"a symbol against Totalitarianism\"\n\nThe Mayor of Thessaloniki Yannis Boutaris announced his intentions to create a Holocaust Museum in the city, during a municipal council meeting on Monday.\n\nMr. Boutaris explained that along with an education center on Nazism, the Museum would not be \"dedicated to the eradication of 55,000 fellow citizens, but a symbol against Totalitarianism\".\n\nA study for the creation of the Holocaust museum will be presented in the near future. The museum will likely be constructed in the building complex of the old railway station.", "On September 11, of all dates, and in New York, of all places, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was selling European passports in the US.\n\nHe told his audience at a Global Citizenship seminar that the government's aim behind its 'Citizen by Investment' programme was not investment after all, but talent. He said: \"Malta wants your talent, not your money. Your networks, not your accounts.\" Oh yes, our Prime Minister knows a thing or two about networks, all right.\n\nBut clich\u00e9s apart (he really needs to get a proper speech writer), what's the point of a bill of around \u20ac1 million in fees to buy a European passport in Malta when all you are after is talent? There must be talent crossing the Mediterranean for free on rickety boats, but they're the wrong colour, they don't come with wads of money, so we tell them to collect our garbage instead. In any case, that avenue of talent is now closed. The Italians are picking up most of the migrants now, although exactly why they are doing that and what Malta has promised in return, we are never told. That's Muscat's networking for you.\n\nIf it is talent that Malta is seeking, then that should be a main condition for a passport, not the processing fees and a rental agreement for an apartment in Malta. Obviously, to try to make any logical sense out of Muscat's waffle is a waste of time. We are selling European passports; that is the beginning and the end of it. Anyone with the kind of talent the Prime Minister is speaking of can easily land himself a job in the EU. He does not need a passport from us.\n\nIt is probable that this talk of talent is a marketing tactic by our Prime Minister to sell passports. A bit of flattery always helps a sale. He's certainly good at that, and it looks like he's going to need to sell quite a lot of passports to placate the many flattered voters who are getting restless because he's promised them heaven on earth, or better, he's promised them what they can't get or don't deserve.\n\nThat incredibly pathetic speech in New York reads like a tourist brochure; a bit more like a 'retirement in the sun' scheme than an invitation to people with 'talent' and a million euros to spare.\n\nMalta, Muscat said, has 7,000 years of history and 300 days of sunshine every year. It is also a melting pot of civilisations (for heaven's sake, the whole world is!) and obviously, home to megalithic temples, which are the oldest freestanding monuments in the world. Actually they are not; France beats us at that, and probably Turkey too. Muscat never cared much for details anyway.\n\nThere was also the other all-important point that our temples are older than the Egyptian pyramids. Yes, so is probably my back garden wall.\n\nHe then told them that Malta would soon be home to the \"latest creation of global architecture [sic] superstar Renzo Piano\". He left out the bit about how his party thinks the Piano City Gate project is a waste of money and that according to another superstar, Transport Minster Joe Mizzi, the garden that was to be part of this masterpiece shall instead be turned into a car park. Such elegance, such sensitivity and style: you'd have thought Labour never had it in them.\n\nWell, we can excuse Muscat for telling half of the Piano story because he was selling Malta and that we shouldn't be washing our dirty linen in the international public eye, especially if it is Labour linen.\n\nThen came the bombshell. As Muscat made his pitch for cash and yes, talent too if you happen to have it, he looked majestically into the future and said: \"We believe these are the new borders of a brave new world.\"\n\nIn the last century, there were two visionary books that looked pessimistically into the future. There was Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and we received a twisted version of that in the golden years of Labour. The system failed miserably and kept Labour on the opposition benches for a quarter century.\n\nMuscat now opts for the other book, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, which proposes a softer form of totalitarianism, one based on a drug called soma that ensures that no one is ever unhappy in a pleasure-seeking society, free of religion, permanently entertained, and of course, suppressed.\n\nIn Muscat's Brave New World people are kept doped with VAT rebates, two-cent fuel cuts, free concerts, promises of mega projects, decriminalised marijuana and yes, a three-legged horse statue at City Gate to flatter that growing stream of pseudo-artists.\n\nThat horse is a brilliant piece, and that's not just because it has exposed the immense ignorance in this country. Like all art, it is useless, and that is what it should be. What it should not be is State-financed, because then it is no longer art, it is an indulgence - dope.\n\nIn the Brave New World that will be Malta, Muscat told his New York audience, there would be \"legislative agility\" and a \"short legislative distance between investors and policymakers\". In Malta, those who take decisions are \"accessible and ready to listen\". In other words, it's a free for all. Just take a look at the countryside and you see what you get. Look at the anarchy in Armier and now San Blas. That's what happens when decision-makers are accessible.\n\nIn Muscat's Brave New World, it is a wild world, where everything is negotiable, principles and values especially. This kind of world does not attract investment or talent. It just attracts pirates, adventurers and corruption.\n\nIt is not backroom arrangements that true investors with talent want. They want a free market economy, with proper stringent laws, just like we have for the financial sector, thanks to the Nationalist Party. They don't want a flexible government. They don't want a pirate country with a banana government to whom you can readily turn to at whim. They want to be free to operate, and the smaller and more distant government is, the better.\n\nWhy is it so impossible for Labour to understand that the root of Malta's success story lies with freedom and rule of law and not with backroom deals with the likes of Gaddafi and Kim il Sung and now possibly China?\n\nWith this kind of thinking, Muscat is the worst prime minister to have at the helm as Malta's independence turns 50.\n\nWith its ups and downs, independence has been a success story, thanks mainly to the Nationalist Party and certainly no thanks to infantile pipe dreams like the 'neutrality' the great Dom Mintoff shoved down our throats, like he shoved down much of everything else he did.\n\nNow our Foreign Affairs Minister George Vella, conscious of another brewing conflict down south in the country Mintoff so much loved to visit - Libya - is admitting that neutrality is no guarantee that the country shall remain untouched.\n\nSo finally, the cracks are beginning to show in that constitutional provision that insists we are to keep equidistant between two superpowers, one of which no longer exists.\n\n\"The time has come to revise our military defence provisions,\" Vella said, because what applied in the 1980s does not apply to today's circumstances. He doesn't explain what the new provisions would be. The truth is, neutrality has never served for anything. Working for peace in the region is fine, ineffective as Malta may be. But insisting on staying neutral when there is a clear choice between what is right and wrong, that is an amoral foreign policy and intrinsically wrong.\n\nIn Muscat's Brave New World, nothing is intrinsically wrong, so long as it foments a feel-good factor as our environment pays a horrible price, as will our children. Selling passports is not a Brave New World. It is degenerate, like much of what Labour has stood for over the years.\n\nWith nothing to offer from its history but rot, no wonder the government has hijacked the 50th anniversary independence celebrations, under the excuse of unity, another Labour piece of dope. \"It was destiny that Labour has the opportunity to organise the celebrations,\" Muscat said on Sunday. It's bad karma for the country, more likely.\n\nThe sad thing about all this is that people are still falling for this rhetoric, because they still have hope for a perfect society under our visionary Muscat.\n\nThomas More's Utopia would make good reading for them. It's satirical, by the way.", "BRUSSELS -- NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that members of the U.S.-led alliance must stand shoulder to shoulder to confront simultaneous security threats from Russia and the Islamic State extremist organization.\n\nIn his Brussels farewell speech as NATO's top civilian official, Rasmussen said the alliance finds itself on the front line of a geopolitical division between \"tolerance and fanaticism,\" and \"democracy and totalitarianism.\"\n\n\"We must stand strong as a force for freedom,\" said Rasmussen. He said NATO and its member nations must face the fact that the new security challenges it is now confronting could last for years.\n\nRasmussen's five-year term as NATO secretary general ends Sept. 30. He spoke at a Brussels gathering of the Carnegie Europe think tank.\n\nRasmussen said NATO must be ready to use military force, and to muster the political will when needed. In a question-and-answer session that followed his speech, he said he favored the use of armed force against the Islamic State organization, which he said threatens not only governments in the Arab world, but also Western societies through the export of terrorism.\n\nHe said NATO as such is not considering involvement in such operations. He denounced the mass killings that the Islamic State militants have carried out in territory that it has seized as \"close to genocide.\"\n\nRasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, said that under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has \"trampled all the rules and commitments\" that kept the peace in Europe since the end of the Cold War, and conducted illegal military actions against Ukraine.\n\nHe said he believes the NATO summit in Wales this month demonstrated to Russia that the alliance is determined to defend its members.\n\nThe lesson of history, Rasmussen said, it that \"appeasement does not lead to peace. It just incites tyrants.\"", "REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA - The government and the House of Representatives have agreed to raise the country's oil production target to 900,000 barrels per day from 845,000 barrels set in the original draft budget.\n\nThe increase could potentially mean an addition of 11 trillion IDR a year to state revenues before cost recovery, according to caretaker head of the Fiscal Policy Body of the Finance Ministry Andin Hadiyanto.\n\n\"Cost recovery is yet to be recalculated . The cost is higher with oil wells getting older. I will have to ask for the data form the SKK Migas (Upstream Oil and Gas Regulator),\" Hadiyanto said on Monday.\n\nHe said, the finance ministry would recalculate additional revenues to be set in the revised draft state budget because of the change in projection in the original draft budget for 2015. In addition to additional income form an increase in oil production, the government is set to optimize tax revenue, contribution from state companies.\n\nTax revenues are expected to increase by 9 trillion IDR and contribution from state companies to rise by 3 trillion IDR. State revenues, therefore, would be larger than originally set in the original draft budget, with no much change in spending, Hadiyanto said.\n\nDeficit, therefore was expected to narrow although state expenditures were yet to be recalculated and discussed at the parliament, he added.\n\nThe target for total state revenues in the 2015 draft state budget is set at 1,762.3 trillion IDR consisting of 1,370.8 trillion IDR in taxes, 388 trillion IDR in non taxes, 3.4 trillion IDR in grants.\n\nState expenditure target is set at 2,019.9 trillion IDR broken down into spending by the central government at 1,379.9 trillion IDR and transfers to the regional administrations at 640 trillion IDR. The deficit, therefore, is projected at 257.6 trillion IDR or 2.32 percent of the country's GDP.", "BANGKOK -- His legacy is inseparable from the past decade of political tumult in Thailand, but high school students will not find the name Thaksin Shinawatra in the history textbooks that the country's military junta recently ordered schools to use.\n\nMr. Thaksin's name was scrubbed from the book by the Ministry of Education, said the textbook's author, Thanom Anarmwat.\n\n\"The officials at the ministry just deleted it, cut it,\" he said.\n\nMr. Thaksin (pronounced TAHK-sin) elicits love or hate in Thailand and not much in between.\n\nTo members of the Bangkok establishment who supported the May military coup, which ousted an elected government backed by Mr. Thaksin, he is seen as venal, corrupt and, perhaps most of all, a threat to their power.\n\nTo his supporters, Mr. Thaksin was the first politician in Thailand to focus on the needs of voters outside Bangkok and gain their allegiance by delivering universal health care, microloans and more efficient government services.\n\nThe generals, who have seized power twice in the past decade, say they are not taking sides. But in addition to abolishing elections and banning political activities, they have purged the bureaucracy of those seen to be loyal to Mr. Thaksin.\n\nThe Education Ministry's order last month that all public high schools use the new textbook is part of a broader effort to instill patriotism in Thai youth. The junta has ordered a new school curriculum that underlines what are seen to be the unifying themes of the monarchy and the glories of the ancient kingdoms of Siam, as Thailand was formerly known.\n\nThere are numerous examples, especially in Asia, of government deletions of undesirable facts and faces from official history. In China, history textbooks do not mention the military crackdown on the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square, and many young people know little or nothing about it. In North Korea, the uncle of Kim Jong-un, the country's leader, was edited out of state television footage after the uncle was executed last year.\n\nThai history textbooks have very little coverage of the leftist movements of the 1960s and 1970s and the government's efforts to suppress them.\n\nBut in today's Thailand -- plugged into the world, freewheeling and linked through social media technologies beyond the government's control -- it is unclear to what degree the military can erase the society's deep divisions from the public's consciousness.\n\n\"This is very much the usual practice of Thai elite,\" said Charnvit Kasetsiri, former rector of the prestigious Thammasat University. \"But it will be difficult because of social media and because it is not that easy to control the thinking of the masses, especially educated youth.\"\n\nChris Baker, a leading authority on Thai history, sees the historical censorship as misguided.\n\n\"Snipping history like this is straight out of the handbook of totalitarian regimes,\" he said. \"I think doing this in a society that has become as open as Thailand is counterproductive, because people will notice the absence.\"\n\nThe government has not announced or explained the deletion.\n\nWinai Rodjay, who was appointed by the military government as chairman of a committee on the teaching of history and civic duty, said the omission of Mr. Thaksin was an aberration. But he could not explain how it had happened or why.\n\n\"I think the editor may have cut it,\" he said, adding that he would prefer that Mr. Thaksin's name be inserted the next time the textbook was revised.\n\nUnder the new curriculum, students will learn more about the meaning and symbolism of Thailand's tricolor national flag, and songs such as the king's anthem will be played in schools.\n\nSchoolchildren will be trained to act as ambassadors of patriotic spirit, Mr. Winai said. He gave the hypothetical example of students reprimanding adults who fail to stand at attention during the national anthem, which is played on radio stations and on public broadcast systems at 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.\n\n\"The students might go and ask, 'Why aren't you standing straight when the national anthem is played?' \" he said.\n\nThe junta has issued a list of 12 values for the country, including gratitude toward parents, discipline, morality and the maintaining of \"physical and mental strength against greed.\" Large banners bearing the list are being posted at schools nationwide.\n\nThe Education Ministry has also introduced a \"merit passport,\" in which students must keep a record of their behavior and attitudes.\n\nBefore the coup, schools were allowed to choose from a variety of history textbooks.\n\nThe one that is now the standard had been commissioned by the previous military junta, which seized power from Mr. Thaksin in 2006. The previous edition mentioned Mr. Thaksin at least seven times.\n\nThe new text covers the political history of Thailand's past two decades in five pages, citing the names of many previous prime ministers and other protagonists, including Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the general who overthrew Mr. Thaksin in 2006.\n\nAlthough it does not name Mr. Thaksin or his political party, it describes \"a government\" that used \"many policies designed to gain popularity from people through huge budgets.\"\n\nMr. Thaksin was in power from 2001 to 2006, and his political movement has won every election in the past decade and a half, including a number of landslides. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was prime minister from 2011 until she was removed from office in May.\n\nWithout mentioning either sibling, the textbook does touch on the opposition to Mr. Thaksin's rule. A subheading describes the protests that preceded his ouster as \"the people's movement against dictatorial power, corruption and embezzlement.\"\n\nMr. Thanom, the textbook author, said that many people might dislike Mr. Thaksin but that he should not be deleted from history.\n\n\"History is fact,\" he said. \"Mistakes or lesson learned -- we have to tell our young people. They must know about it. We shouldn't just delete it.\"", "WikiLeaks man talks with Ars -- new book may reveal more about him than its subject.\n\nIt would be too much to say that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange feels optimistic. He's been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for more than two years now, with cameras and police -- \"a \u00a33 million surveillance operation,\" he calls it -- just meters away.\n\n\"There's a sense of inevitability now,\" Assange said when we asked if his situation might change.\n\nAssange: \"The situation is clarifying politically and legally.\"\n\nArs: \"I just want to be clear on this point -- are you saying you're hopeful you'll be free soon?\"\n\nAssange: \"I wouldn't say hopeful. I would say it's inevitable. It's inevitable that we will win the diplomatic standoff we're in now.\"\n\nIt's getting late in London, where Assange is doing a barrage of press interviews on the eve his new book, When Google Met Wikileaks (it goes on sale in the US later this week). We called at the agreed upon time, and a man who didn't identify himself answered the number, which was for a London cell phone. He said call back in five minutes, and only then was the phone finally handed to Assange.\n\nWe're supposed to focus on the book. But first, we want to know what life trapped in the embassy involves -- where does he eat, sleep, do laundry? What is the room he's was in now like?\n\n\"For security reasons, I can't tell you which sections of the embassy I utilize,\" he said. \"As to the rest, in a way, it's a perfectly normal situation. In another way, it's one of the most abnormal, unusual situations that someone can find themselves in.\"\n\nAssange ushered WikiLeaks through several massive leaks of secret US government reports and a tumultuous relationship with some prominent newspapers. First came the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of military reports on the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, then a leak of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the State Department.\n\nHe sought asylum from Ecuador when he was on the verge of being extradited to Sweden to face sexual-assault charges in that nation. If he leaves the embassy, he'll be arrested, although it isn't clear where he'll be sent first. It's widely assumed the US has an ongoing investigation into Assange over the leaks.\n\nAsked about what his future outside the embassy walls might look like, he stays focused on the legal battles ahead. \"We have a lot of dominos to knock over,\" he said. \"There are three or four different legal cases going on, and technical means to obstruct the asylum.\"\n\nHe knows his travel will always be circumscribed to a degree, but Assange seems comfortable with that. He's cognizant of the parallels between his situation and that of Edward Snowden's.\n\n\"He has freedom of movement,\" Assange acknowledged. \"But his freedom of movement excludes a number of countries which can be pressured by the US, and that's also true for me.\"\n\nHis voice sounded scratchy, as he spoke to Ars about how Google, and its chairman Eric Schmidt, were at the \"center of American power,\" pushing an \"aggressive new ideology.\" In the background, another phone started ringing. Assange wasn't distracted. Half prisoner, half professor, he kept talking in the same slow cadence, with an insistent and didactic focus on making his point.\n\nBreaking the Google Glass\n\nAssange's book is part dissertation, part self-interested reference work, and all grudge match. Most of the work is dedicated to dismantling another text: that's The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen, the head of \"Google Ideas\" and a former analyst at the State Department. The first 50 pages of Assange's book explores the role Schmidt fills in today's global power network: \"the point where the centrist, liberal, and imperialist tendencies meet in American political life.\" That long essay attacking The New Digital Age is followed by... a short essay attacking Schmidt's book, a reprint of Assange's 2013 op-ed in the New York Times entitled \"The Banality of 'Don't Be Evil.\"\n\nThe next several chapters -- the bulk of Assange's book -- are actually a transcript of his single meeting with Schmidt in June 2011, when Schmidt interviewed him for The New Digital Age. This heavily-footnoted section is followed by another short essay, \"Deliver us from 'Don't Be Evil,'\" in which Assange invites readers to look at how WikiLeaks was portrayed in Schmidt's book and \"compare against the source material.\"\n\nIt gives the distinct impression that Assange seems fairly obsessed with Schmidt. We asked him to explain his book's intense focus on the man.\n\n\"Schmidt and his network represent what is becoming the center of American power,\" he said. \"This is not a group of people who, by their personalities, are necessarily bad people. But they happen to have an aggressive new ideology that is able to amass significant amounts of power -- precisely because it is represented by individuals that dress themselves in a mantle of reformist rhetoric. Now it's merged with traditional forms of power, mostly based in Washington. It's the most modern form of company structure that we have.\"\n\nGoogle has doubled its market capitalization in a few years, and \"its reach now extends to every person in one way or another,\" says Assange. It extends to the million-plus people each day who activate Android phones. They \"may not think they're using the Internet,\" but of course, they are.\n\n\"Out of my comfort zone\"\n\nAssange speaks of his book as a kind of diagram of how power works in the age of the Internet: an analysis of the \"positioning\" of Google and Schmidt, he explained. But plenty of it reads like good, old-fashioned score-settling, albeit with an academic veneer. Assange describes how he was excited to get his hands on a copy of Schmidt's book and \"had someone carry a copy past the police cordon so I could read it.\"\n\nYet Assange seems shocked that book -- penned by one of Silicon Valley's wealthiest executives and the government functionary he brought into the Googleplex -- isn't sufficiently revolutionary. Having smuggled a copy into the embassy that has become his prison, Assange condemns Schmidt's work as having \"failed to deliver -- failed even to imagine a future, good or bad, substantially different to the present.\" He writes:\n\nThe book was a simplistic fusion of Fukuyama \"end of history\" ideology -- out of vogue since the 1990s -- and faster mobile phones. It was padded out with DC shibboleths, State Department orthodoxies, and fawning grabs from Henry Kissinger. The scholarship was poor -- even degenerate. It did not seem to fit the profile of Schmidt, that sharp, quiet man in my living room.\n\nUltimately, Assange completes his journey and grows to understand the meaning of Schmidt's visit to see him. The \"burgeoning digital superstate\" of Google \"was offering to be Washington's geopolitical visionary.\" Schmidt, in a sense, was acting -- doing \"back-channel diplomacy\" for the government. \"While WikiLeaks had been deeply involved in publishing the inner archive of the US State Department, the US State Department had, in effect, snuck into the WikiLeaks command center and hit me up for a free lunch,\" writes Assange.\n\nDespite his belief that Schmidt and Cohen were mining him for information, Assange rates their performance -- and his own -- as stellar:\n\nTo their credit, I consider the interview perhaps the best I have ever given. I was out of my comfort zone and I liked it. We ate and then took a walk in the grounds, all while on the record. I asked Eric Schmidt to leak US government information requests to WikiLeaks, and he refused, suddenly nervous, citing the illegality of disclosing Patriot Act requests. And then as the evening came on it was done and they were gone, back to the unreal, remote halls of information empire, and I was left to get back to my work.\n\nWhen Schmidt's book published, it was met with \"only uncomprehending praise,\" Assange seethes. That's an odd thing to say, since Assange himself was invited to critique it in the best-known English language newspaper in the world. Assange's New York Times essay on the book, which he slams as a \"blueprint for technocratic imperialism, from two of its leading witch doctors,\" was likely read by at least as many people as read Schmidt's book.\n\nBut that was insufficient for Assange, so he has now published a book-length assault on Schmidt and his connections. It's a single-minded tome: an angry, erudite, unredacted letter from the world's most unusual prisoner.\n\n\"A place where politics happens\"\n\nAssange does bring up important issues. To him and his sympathizers, the erosion of privacy is making the free world look more totalitarian, not the geeky paradise envisioned by Internet utopians. But it's hard to escape the feeling that his book is essentially an extension of points he made effectively in his 2013 Times piece. The added depth feels like fist-banging, not proving points.\n\nIn a way, the intense focus on Google prevents Assange from telling his own story in a meaningful way -- but that was never his intention. It's telling that Assange, having readied an autobiography together with a ghost writer, decided to spike the work after seeing a first draft. \"All memoir is prostitution,\" he declared to his publisher in 2011, seeking to cancel the contract. Months later, Canongate Books went ahead and published the \"Unauthorized Autobiography\" without his consent.\n\nFor the dedicated reader, there is information about Assange and his project in When Google Meets Wikileaks -- such as Assange's changing view on how, and when, to redact leaked cables. But it's presented through the stilted view of a conversation with Schmidt.\n\nIn Assange's mind, the redactions of the leaked material made by the world's newspapers were massive, far more than what was needed. In his talk with Schmidt, he describes The Guardian removing \"two-thirds of a cable about Bulgarian crime,\" including the names of \"all the mafiosi who had infiltrated the Bulgarian government... They are worried that they might get sued for libel in London.\" The Irish Independent redacted the names of corrupt companies, \"even though it's a very good newspaper and the journalists are totally onside.\" Overall, it amounts to \"incredible self-censorship.\"\n\nAssange told Ars that WikiLeaks could have done a better job policing the media outlets he worked with. They agreed to redact only for \"human rights reasons,\" he said, but ultimately \"they redacted for political reasons\" as well.\n\nAssange describes WikiLeaks' role as a role of historical one, but it's hardly complete. One doesn't have to look any further than today's headlines about the FinFisher leak to see that the site is still making news.\n\n\"WikiLeaks has performed an important role in demonstrating what can be done, and the technology to do it,\" he said. \"That's caused others to emulate some of our methods.\n\n\"Most importantly, all of this has inspired other whistleblowers to come forward in different ways. It's inspired people to believe that the Internet is a place where politics happens. Politics in the sense of, being a place where society is shaped. I think if you go back five years, the Internet was an apolitical space.\"\n\nTo close, we asked him about geography. He didn't see much irony in the fact that advocates for transparency and liberalism, like himself and Edward Snowden, have ultimately found protection from regimes that aren't very liberal.\n\n\"Well, Ecuador wasn't thought of as anything until it gave me asylum -- then there was a campaign to describe it as illiberal,\" he said. \"Asylum is a serious business. People seeking political asylum, by definition, are doing so to avoid persecution. They go to the country most likely to protect them from that persecution, out of the countries that feel strong enough, or independent enough, to do so.\n\n\"Edward Snowden and I, and some others who didn't manage to get out, have become Western political dissidents. There is a power alliance through the major institutions of the West -- that's why they call it the West. So it's only going to be non-Western countries that are able to offer asylum.\"", "Lois Lowry's 1993 novel \"The Giver\" has garnered a very wide audience over the past two decades, since it has become a standard text in middle schools and high schools across the English-speaking world. With the enormous success of the \"Harry Potter,\" \"Twilight,\" and \"Hunger Games\" films, Hollywood has been busy adapting books written for the young adult audience. The most recent example is the movie version of \"The Giver,\" which was produced by Jeff Bridges and stars Bridges and Meryl Streep. Having never even heard of the novel, I came at the film with no expectations, and I confess I was quite surprised both by the power of its societal critique and by its implicit Christian themes.\n\nThe story is set in the near future, in a seemingly utopian city, where there is no conflict, no inequality and no stress. The streets are laid out in a perfectly symmetrical grid, the domiciles and public buildings are clean, even antiseptic, and the people dress in matching outfits and ride bicycles so as not to pollute the environment. The \"elders,\" the leadership of the community, artificially arrange families and carefully assign vocations, all for the sake of the common good. In order to eliminate any volatile emotions that might stir up resentment or compromise the perfect equilibrium of the society, each citizen is obligated to take a daily injection of a kind of sedative. If someone's speech veers even mildly in the direction of suggesting self-assertion or individuality, he is corrected with a gentle but firm admonition: \"precision of language, please.\" Most chillingly, the elderly and unacceptable children are eliminated, though the people have been conditioned not to think of this as killing but only as a peaceful transition to \"Elsewhere.\" The calm \"sameness\" of the city is maintained, above all, through the erasing of memory: no one is permitted to remember the colorful but conflictual world that preceded the present utopia. No one, that is, except the Giver, an elder who retains memories of the previous world for the sole purpose of consulting them in case an emergency arises and specialized knowledge is called for.\n\nUtopian societies, maintained through totalitarian control, have been dreamed about at least since the time of Plato, and many attempts have been made over the centuries to realize the dream. The 20th century witnessed quite a few of them: Mao's China, Stalin's Soviet Union, Hitler's Third Reich, Pol Pot's Cambodia. Indeed, there are echoes of all of these social arrangements in \"The Giver's\" version of utopia, but I think what \"The Giver's\" city most readily calls to mind is modern liberalism, especially in its European incarnation. We find the fierce enforcement of politically correct speech, the manic attempt to control the environment, coldly modernist architecture, the prizing of equality as the supreme value, the rampant use of drugs, the denial of death, and the wanton exercise of both euthanasia and abortion. Will all of this produce a balanced and peaceful society? Well, it might bring about a kind of equilibrium, but at a terrible cost.\n\nThe plot of \"The Giver\" centers on a young man named Jonas who was chosen by the elders to become the sole recipient of the suppressed memory of the previous world. Through a sort of telepathy, the Giver communicates to Jonas all of the richness, color, drama, and joy of the pre-utopian society. The most beguiling image he receives is of himself sledding down a snowy hill and coming upon a cottage from which he hears emerging the strains of a song he had never heard before (in fact, both snow and music had been excluded from his world). In time, the Giver fills out the picture, communicating to the young man the pain and conflict of the previous world as well. Though at first he is horrified by that experience, Jonas realizes that the colorful world, even with its suffering, would be preferable to the bloodless and inhuman dystopia in which he had been raised. As the story moves to its climax, Jonas escapes from the city and ventures out into the forbidden wilderness. The weather turns fiercely cold and he wanders through the snow until he comes to a clearing where he spies the sled that he had previously seen in memory. Following the prompts of the recollection, he rides the sled down a snowy hill, comes to the quaint cottage, and listens to the song. It is only then that we hear that they are singing the best-known and best-loved Christmas hymn, \"Silent Night.\"\n\nAnd now we see that what makes the society in \"The Giver\" most like contemporary Europe is precisely the forgetfulness of Christianity. What the story suggests, quite rightly, is that suppression of the good news of the Incarnation is in fact what conduces to dysfunctional and dangerous totalitarianism. The source of the greatest suffering throughout human history is the attempt to deal with original sin on our own, through our political, economic, military or cultural efforts. When we try to eliminate conflict and sin through social reform, we inevitably make matters worse. As Pascal said long ago, \"He who would turn himself into an angel, turns himself into a beast.\" The key to joy at the personal level and justice at the societal level is in fact the conviction that God has dealt with original sin by taking it on himself and suffering with us and for us. This belief allows us to embrace the world in both its beauty and its tragedy, for we see salvation as God's project, not our own. It is the Incarnation -- the event celebrated by the singing of \"Silent Night\" -- that frees us from our self-importance and gives the lie to our programs of perfectibility.", "BRUSSELS -- Western nations must take military action against Islamic State militants because they pose a global threat, not just because of the murder of Western hostages, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday.\n\nHis comments came as the world's top diplomats pledged support to Iraq at a conference in Paris following the beheading of a third hostage, and as US Secretary of State John Kerry stepped up efforts to forge a broad anti-jihadist coalition.\n\n\"ISIS is a group of terrorists with whom there is no chance whatsoever to negotiate,\" Rasmussen said in Brussels when asked why the West was acting only now and not months earlier when the group first took over swathes of Iraq.\n\nHe said they pose a threat \"not only to Iraq but to the world\" and that the group's actions were \"very close to a genocide.\"\n\n\"We are on the frontline of a new battle -- a new battle between tolerance and fanaticism, between democracy and totalitarianism, between open and closed societies.\"\n\nRasmussen said that IS was the biggest threat the military alliance faces apart from tensions with Russia -- but that while immediate action was necessary against the jihadists, Moscow's actions in Ukraine did not pose an \"imminent threat\" to NATO.\n\nHe said Iraq had not invited NATO itself to take part in the fight against Islamic State but that the alliance was ready to offer support by helping build the capacity of the armed forces, coordinating allies and sharing intelligence.\n\nIt is \"important\" to bring regional allies into the coalition but that \"takes some time,\" he added.\n\nFormer Danish premier Rasmussen's speech came as he prepares to hand over the reins as NATO secretary general to Jens Stoltenberg, the ex-prime minister of Norway, at the end of September.\n\nRasmussen denied that Western powers were hard pressed to tackle both the security challenge from IS and a threat from a resurgent Russia, which the West accuses of sending troops in support of rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"We are able to handle the broad range of security challenges whether they are seen to the east or the south,\" Rasmussen said.\n\nRussia's actions in Ukraine and elsewhere \"trampled all the rules and commitments that have kept peace in Europe and beyond since the end of the Cold War,\" he said.\n\nBut he added: \"I don't think Russia poses an imminent threat to NATO allies for the very reason that Russia knows that we have an Article Five that protects any ally against attack.\"\n\nArticle five of NATO's Washington treaty calls for the alliance to come to the collective defense of any one member if it comes under attack.\n\nHe said he was still hopeful of finding a political solution in Ukraine and that Russia would be \"capable to negotiate if they decided to.\""]}}
