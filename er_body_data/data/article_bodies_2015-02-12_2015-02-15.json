{"Samsung": {"2015-02-12": ["The company will launch a phone accessory store later this year\n\nThe biggest Android smartphone maker most Americans have probably never heard of is taking its first step into the U.S. market.\n\nXiaomi, which in just four years has gone from nothing to leading the Chinese market, will launch a U.S. version of its online shopping site later this year but it won't sell the low-cost, high-spec phones for which the company has gained its reputation.\n\nInstead, it will sell a selection of phone accessories like battery packs and headphones. That doesn't mean a U.S. launch of its phones has been ruled out, however.\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [smartphones and tablets] to market is significant,\" said Hugo Barra, the one-time Google executive who is now vice president for international markets at Xiaomi in Beijing. Barra, who was speaking to reporters in San Francisco, noted the various certifications required to sell products in each country, the need to strike deals with carriers and organize customer support.\n\n\"It's an incredible amount of work and we have to move at the right pace,\" he said. \"We're accelerating our entry by bringing simpler products.\"\n\nWhile Barra wouldn't commit to if or when Xiaomi will launch hardware, it appears to be on the company's mind. Thursday's event was held to introduce reporters to company executives and give them a chance to see Xiaomi handsets, many probably for the first time. The company also handed out samples of its MiNote 2 smartphone to some reporters and said it was keen to hear what they thought of the phone.\n\nIn China, the company has become a favorite among local users by continually seeking suggestions and improvements for its version of the Android operating system. Users vote on what features are added and every Friday at 5 p.m. local time, an update is published. This week marks the 225th weekly update.\n\nThe features include the functional, such as software detection of spam calls (a big problem in China), the useful, like shortcuts to popular items on the McDonald's China online phone ordering system, and frivolous ones such as cartoon skins for the phone's user interface.\n\nThe company also makes its own hardware. It releases a new phone roughly once a year, emphasizing quality and low price -- a formula that enabled it to beat Samsung to take the biggest share of the Chinese market in late 2014.\n\nThe company's overseas ambitions have so far been confined to Asian nations where price-conscious consumers buy phones outright rather than through carrier subsidies, and the road hasn't always been smooth.\n\nIn India, Xiaomi is embroiled in a patent dispute with Ericsson over wireless technology. On Thursday when asked if patent concerns were delaying a U.S. market entry, co-founder and President Bin Lin spoke of the number of patents it holds but didn't directly answer the question.\n\nThe company attributes a lot of its success to the support from its users, who it calls \"fans.\" Indeed, millions follow or support the company on social media and its message board buzzes with feedback and suggestions, but it remains to be seen if that formula can be translated to success in the U.S.\n\nMartyn Williams covers mobile telecoms, Silicon Valley and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

Instead, Xiaomi will sell its lesser-known ancillary products such as headphones and its Mi Band wearable fitness tracker.\n\nRelated stories CNET reviews Xiaomi's slick Mi Note Mi Note sells out in under three minutes Xiaomi, China's largest smartphone vendor\n\nAn online store signifies the first step towards its eagerly anticipated entry into the US market. While not a household name, Xiaomi has steadily built up its reputation among the tech savvy as \"the Apple of China\" with affordable and slick-designed devices packed with high-end components, all with price tags that are sometimes half that of its competitors' products. Further adding to the hype is its position as the world's most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $45 billion. But the Western markets represent a different beast -- one where consumers gravitate to the biggest names like Apple and Samsung.\n\nHugo Barra, a former Google executive who left the search company to join Xiaomi as vice president of international operations in 2013, said the company wants to be calculated and careful when bringing its flagship products to new markets. It's a now-recurring theme for the start-up that considers itself an Internet services company -- not just a handset maker.\n\n\"The amount of effort required to bring those products [phones and tablets] to market is significant. We just have to move at the right pace,\" Barra told the audience. \"So we're accelerating our entry in a sense by bringing simpler products.\" Barra cited factors like manufacturing, packaging, regulations and the software hurdles with a language gap for the slow arrival of Xiaomi phones in Western markets.\n\nGlass-clad Xiaomi Mi Note sparkles (pict... See full gallery 1 - 4 / 13 Next Prev\n\nXiaomi is growing at an incredible pace, having amassed more than 100 million users of its MIUI operating system, a variant of Google's Android OS, in just four and a half years since its August 2010 founding.\n\nXiaomi is now the leading seller of smartphones in China and accounted for five out of every eight Android phone activations in the last month, the company said, thanks to large followings in developing markets like India, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nIt's the world's sixth largest smartphone manufacturer, according to research firm TrendForce, although its upward trajectory suggest it'll likely move up the ranks throughout the year. The pace of that growth has many wondering when Xiaomi will expand to markets where Apple and Samsung have captured large percentages of the market. Xiaomi prefers to take its time.\n\nXiaomi's strategy of launching an online store echoes similar plays run by fellow Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Alcatel. While these companies supply cheaper smartphones to prepaid customers through their carrier relationships, they are attempting to push their higher end flagship smartphones directly to consumers through their own online presence.\n\nXiaomi, however, is moving even more gingerly, holding off on its marquee smartphone products for now.", "What if you could complain directly to Google about every little thing that bothered you about the Android operating system? And what if every time you complained, Google fixed a bug just for you?\n\nThe Chinese handset maker, Xiaomi, has built an empire of 100 million users worldwide on this exact premise. \"We're an Internet company,\" said Bin Lin, President of Xiaomi, at a press event on Thursday. \"We're not just interested in making handsets.\"\n\nWhile it's true that Xiaomi has been particularly successful selling directly to customers rather than through other retailers or carriers, that's not what Lin was referring to. He was boasting about the company's massive user base overseas, which has grown rapidly thanks to savvy social media tactics. \"They are not our customers, they are our fans,\" added Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who left in 2012 to serve as Vice President of Global Operations at Xiaomi.\n\nXiaomi has gone to great lengths to accommodate these \"fans.\" For instance, when the company launched its first ROM in 2010, there were only 100 users, but after it started making devices and its marketshare grew, Xiaomi honored those that had stuck with them from the beginning by printing their name in the MIUI boot loader.\n\nThen there was the time a fan requested that Xiaomi make it easier to turn on the flashlight from the Lock screen. He argued that his parents wouldn't have caught him coming home drunk if he wouldn't have made such a racket dropping his keys. A week later, the developers pushed out a software update that included that exact feature. \"Everything we do is with social as a platform,\" said Barra. \"Every market we enter has its differences, but at the core everyone is social, everyone is emotional, everyone loves to be spoken to -- to be marketed at.\"\n\nXiaomi's entrance into the U.S. mobile market will incorporate some of the tactics that have made it famous overseas. Although the company won't initially sell phones and tablets -- Barra said \"the amount of effort required to bring those products to market is significant\" -- it does plan to appeal to U.S. customers (sorry, fans) in a similar manner. Barra cited its recent success in India. \"When we entered India, we didn't know how things were going to turn out. India got it. They understood what we were coming to market with...We were bringing more than anyone had ever brought.\"\n\nUnlike India, the US already has \"more.\" It has Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG, Microsoft, and a whole array of manufacturers vying for marketshare. It also has carriers; most customers don't buy smartphones and tablets directly from the manufacturer when they can get the device subsidized from their cellular provider. There's incentive there that Xiaomi will have to compete with, not to mention a pattern that users have become accustomed to ever since mobile phones became a necessity.\n\nThere's also the question of how Xiaomi plans to market to the everyman -- users that aren't necessarily \"in the know,\" but who do a little research for their bi-annual phone upgrades. I asked Barra about this -- about how he'd get someone like my Mom onboard the Xiaomi train -- and he bluntly answered, \"You'll buy her one.\" Essentially, Xiaomi is banking on its existing \"fans\" to convert their friends and family members, too.\n\nUnfortunately, we won't get to see Xiaomi's plan in action for some time, since it's limited on what it can sell here in the U.S. But the company is very optimistic about its future stateside. \"Building a fan base [in the U.S.] is no different than how we built a fan base in India,\" said Lin. \"Driving marketshare and having a great experience...is really the most important goal for us.\"", "Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low.

Surprisingly, smartphones will not be among them -- at least, at first.\n\nInstead, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi's Global VP, suggested the company might start with items such as a recently-launched pair of headphones and its popular external battery pack, the latter of which sold 15 million units in 2014. The company has no immediate plans for bringing its handsets to the U.S., he added.\n\n\"We might try things in small volumes and see how it goes,\" Barra told Mashable. The former Google VP, who managed Android development before joining Xiaomi in 2013, said the Chinese company might also use social media polls to see which products might sell well stateside. \"We'll actually gain a lot of experience from selling these products here because we'll get a lot of feedback that will actually be globally relevant for us.\"\n\nThat may be true, but rolling out in the U.S. initially with several accessories instead of its cash cow is a pretty safe way for Xiaomi to better understand the U.S. market and decide the best distribution channels without betting the farm. Is launching Mi.com in America enough? How much of an in-store presence should Xiaomi have, if any?\n\nXiaomi's experimental U.S. launch also affords the company a testbed for marketing. While Xiaomi has fast become the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, second only to Apple and Samsung, Xiaomi remains virtually unknown to mainstream America.\n\nThe smartphone maker must also shake a reputation for emulating Apple's hardware and software design, albeit at much lower prices. Its new, flagship smartphone, the Mi Note, technically trumps Apple's latest smartphones spec-for-spec but bears a pretty close resemblance to the iPhone 6 Plus. In fact, the Note's most differentiating feature may be price: at $329 without a carrier contract, the Mi Note costs less than half of an unlocked iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe company's challenge in the U.S market isn't just around building a U.S. presence but setting itself apart from Apple, as well as the hundreds of affordable Android devices up for grabs. If Xiaomi actually finds a way to accomplish all those things, it may realize its ambitious goal of having a true global presence.\n\n\"We have world class products available at awesome prices, so why not bring them here?\" Barra said. \"We needed to build momentum and a team with international skills to be able to do something like this.

What we don't know is when they plan on releasing the darn thing. Last year the Samsung Galaxy S5 was officially announced on February 24th, launching globally on April 11th, 2014.\n\nWhile one could assume Samsung would repeat what they did last year and launch the phone about a month after it's been unveiled, if HTC's same-day announcement/launch for the One M8 taught us anything, it's that competition is fierce and being first out the gate could give Samsung that edge they need to reclaim the crown.\n\nToday, the folks at PhoneArena got a hold of a leaked internal document from an alleged Samsung employee, potentially revealing launch dates for both the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge by way of black out dates (dates employees aren't allowed to take days off). According to the doc, March 22nd - March 30th are cited as mandatory work days, as well as April 19th - April 27th. If we were gambling men, we'd be willing to bet that first date is referring to the Galaxy S6, while the more difficult to produce Galaxy S6 Edge (and its curved display) will be available in late April.\n\nOf course, nothing here is concrete and although the leak looks legit enough, the dates could be tentative. If these dates do pan out, Samsung will have effectively pulled off an announcement/launch ratio the likes very few OEMs have managed to pull off.

That doesn't mean a U.S. launch of its phones has been ruled out, however.\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [smartphones and tablets] to market is significant,\" said Hugo Barra, the one-time Google executive who is now vice president for international markets at Xiaomi in Beijing. Barra, who was speaking to reporters in San Francisco, noted the various certifications required to sell products in each country, the need to strike deals with carriers and organize customer support.\n\n\"It's an incredible amount of work and we have to move at the right pace,\" he said. \"We're accelerating our entry by bringing simpler products.\"\n\nWhile Barra wouldn't commit to if or when Xiaomi will launch hardware, it appears to be on the company's mind. Thursday's event was held to introduce reporters to company executives and give them a chance to see Xiaomi handsets, many probably for the first time. The company also handed out samples of its MiNote 2 smartphone to some reporters and said it was keen to hear what they thought of the phone.\n\nIn China, the company has become a favorite among local users by continually seeking suggestions and improvements for its version of the Android operating system. Users vote on what features are added and every Friday at 5 p.m. local time, an update is published. This week marks the 225th weekly update.\n\nThe features include the functional, such as software detection of spam calls (a big problem in China), the useful, like shortcuts to popular items on the McDonald's China online phone ordering system, and frivolous ones such as cartoon skins for the phone's user interface.\n\nThe company also makes its own hardware. It releases a new phone roughly once a year, emphasizing quality and low price -- a formula that enabled it to beat Samsung to take the biggest share of the Chinese market in late 2014.\n\nThe company's overseas ambitions have so far been confined to Asian nations where price-conscious consumers buy phones outright rather than through carrier subsidies, and the road hasn't always been smooth.\n\nIn India, Xiaomi is embroiled in a patent dispute with Ericsson over wireless technology. On Thursday when asked if patent concerns were delaying a U.S. market entry, co-founder and President Bin Lin spoke of the number of patents it holds but didn't directly answer the question.\n\nThe company attributes a lot of its success to the support from its users, who it calls \"fans.\" Indeed, millions follow or support the company on social media and its message board buzzes with feedback and suggestions, but it remains to be seen if that formula can be translated to success in the U.S.\n\nMartyn Williams covers mobile telecoms, Silicon Valley and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

Hugo Barra, the company's vice president of international, showed off dozens of features Xiaomi has created for its phones, like a \"face beautification\" option that edits facial features to make people appear prettier in their selfies.\n\nXiaomi was valued in a recent fundraising at $46 billion, but Lin said there are no plans for an initial public offering in the next \"three to five years.\"\n\nFounded just five years ago, Xiaomi was the world's fifth-largest smartphone maker in the fourth quarter, with 4.4% global market share according to IDC estimates. It undercuts rivals like Samsung by selling its phones at cost.\n\nThe company said in January it had sold 61 million smartphones in 2014, up 227% from 2013, generating sales of 74.3 billion yuan ($11.9 billion), up 135% from 2013.\n\nThe company now has over 100 million people using its MiUi operating system, a customized version of Google 's Android, said Barra at the event.\n\nAs competition intensifies among makers of Android smartphones, Xiaomi is trying to distinguish itself.\n\n\"We are not a handset company,\" said Lin. \"We are an Internet company.\"", "Most people in the U.S. have never heard of Xiaomi. The five-year-old company is the number one smartphone manufacturer in China and the third largest in the world, trailing only Samsung and Apple.\n\nNow the Beijing-based company wants people in the U.S. to know all about its tablets, phones, and customized Android operating system, MIUI.\n\nThe only catch is, there are no plans to actually sell these things in the U.S. anytime soon. There is a tangle of IP, patent and carrier issues that Xiaomi would have to overcome to sell mobile devices in the U.S.\n\nInstead, it's launching a limited version of its popular e-commerce store, Mi.com, in the states later this year. It won't sell the phones or tablets, only a selection of smaller branded products like headphones, air purifiers, smart home devices, and the oddly popular Mi Bunnies (plush bunnies wearing adorable outfits), of which it's sold 1.97 million.\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [iPhones and tables] to market is significant,\" said Xiaomi vice president Hugo Barra, who was previously a vice president at Google. \"So we're accelerating our entry, in a sense, by bringing in simpler products.\"\n\nDuring a press event in San Francisco on Thursday, Xiaomi president Lin Bin and Barra went over the company's various hardware products, mobile operating system features and meme-heavy marketing approach in excruciating detail.\n\n\"A lot of their success in China is because they have very tightly integrated and localized features in their operating system,\" said Ben Bajarian, an analyst at Creative Strategies.\n\nIn selfie-loving China, that means the front camera estimates age and gender and applies automatic \"beautification\" filters. There are anti-spam call tools, and pre-written greetings for local holidays and festivals. Notifications are strictly controlled to keep users from being overwhelmed.\n\n\"We curate the hell out of this ecosystem to make sure people have more peaceful lives,\" said Barra.\n\nLast year, Xiaomi sold 61 million phones and increased its revenue 135%. It sells mobile devices in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and recently expanded into India. Its MUIU operating system could easily appeal to customers in the United States who fall somewhere in the middle of the Android/iOS spectrum.\n\n\"It's essentially them attempting to test this market,\" said Bajarin.\n\nIn China, Xiaomi relies heavily on social media and a loyal fanbase to do a lot of its marketing. There are regular meet-up events where people perform songs about Xiaomi. Some \"fans\" (the companies preferred euphemism for users) shave the logo into their hair, others Photoshop images of the company's eight founders into famous movie posters.\n\nXiaomi doesn't yet have that kind of enthusiastic, organic user base in the U.S. That's why, at least for now, it's focusing on making more Americans aware of its brand, not winning them over as users.\n\nRecommended", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online.

If you missed it, part 1 focuses on single card 1080p benchmarks, performance, and temps. Get a primer on the GTX 960 by referring back to that. In this installment we'll analyze how the 2GB, 128-bit GTX 960 handles 1440p (2560 x 1440) gaming in single card and 2-way SLI configurations. We'll also continue the showdown between Nvidia's latest \"sweet spot\" graphics card and the comparatively priced Radeon 285 from AMD.\n\nNote: This review marks a permanent transition from my original Intel Intel Core i7-4770K test bench to the newer X99 platform. As such, I'm gradually redoing all prior benchmarks of existing GPUs, which are normally used for direct performance comparisons, charts, etc. The bad news is that the results today will only include the GTX 960 and Radeon 285 as tested on my new system. The upside is that, for the foreseeable future, there will be absolutely zero concern that the CPU will bottleneck performance even at 4K resolutions.\n\nNvidia GTX 960 in 2-way SLI (Photo: Jason Evangelho)\n\nNew Test System Specifications:\n\nIntel Core i7-5960x 16GB G.Skill Ripjaws DDR4 2400MHz RAM ASUS X99-Deluxe motherboard Samsung EVO 840 1TB SSD Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 (ASUS Strix) x2 AMD Radeon 285 (ASUS Strix) x2 Windows 8.1\n\nThe cards being evaluated both belong to the ASUS Strix line, and both are factory overclocked above reference levels. What this means is that an apples-to-apples comparison of both cards is impossible, as the GeForce GTX version can't even be underclocked to reach those reference levels. For our 1440p testing I've simply left clock speeds untouched from their factory levels, though it's worth noting again that the GTX 960 has an insane amount of overclocking potential -- up to 22%.\n\n1440p Single GPU Gaming Benchmarks\n\nOnly recently has gaming at 1440p become a viable, affordable upgrade to 1080p, with the prices of display tech and graphics card hardware alike inspiring adoption at the enthusiast level. When Nvidia's GTX 660 -- even their GTX 760 -- launched, I don't remember them handling 1440p demands with such grace, and the 760 launched at $249 compared to the 960's street price of about $209.\n\n1440p is pushing 1.7 times more pixels than 1080p, so you won't see the consistent 60fps or better performance that was on display in Part 1. That said, I didn't dial back the graphics settings, and the framerates you're seeing below are from fairly demanding games at High to Ultra, with taxing options like Anti-Aliasing and Tessellation activated. These just aren't settings you're used to seeing at playable framerates with a $200 card, but the Radeon 285 and 960 are both up to the task.\n\nGTX 960 vs Radeon 285 at 1440p (Open image in new tab for larger look)\n\nAcross these 7 games, a mixture of titles optimized for either AMD or Nvidia hardware, the GTX 960 averages 48fps, whereas the Radeon 285 averages 47.8fps. There are strange discrepancies like Alien: Isolation and Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, but from a top down view they offer almost dead even performance.\n\nThat performance holds true when looking at 3DMark's Fire Strike Extreme benchmark, with the GTX 960 scoring 3551, and the Radeon 285 a nearly identical 3516.\n\n1440p Two-Way SLI/CrossFire Gaming Benchmarks\n\nJust one appealing factor of these \"sweet spot\" graphics cards is that, provided you have an adequately sized case, power supply, and supporting motherboard, you can upgrade your initial $200 investment by adding another identical graphics card to the mix. Traditionally, this has been a compelling option.\n\nI remember pitting two $269 MSI 760s -- the predecessor to this 960 -- against a $1000 Nvidia Titan and staring at my spreadsheet, awestruck, as that SLI setup consistently outperformed the Titan Titan and 980 at multiple resolutions. Sure, it's going to consume marginally more power and expel a lot of waste heat, but it's going to cost less which is often the primary concern for PC gamers.\n\nAs I mentioned above, due to some technical difficulties (namely, my motherboard frying) I don't have a full spectrum of benchmarks to show you across multiple GPUs, so for now let's directly compare two GTX 960s against two Radeon 285s.\n\nAgain we see the cards trading blows, but ultimately settling for a photo finish. Across these seven games, dual GTX 960s turn in an average framerate of 80.8fps. The dual Radeon 285 setup? 83.2fps, barely edging out its competitor.\n\nGTX 960 (2-way SLI) vs Radeon 285 (x2 CrossFire)\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "SAN FRANCISCO -- Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low.

A South Korean court found that she violated aviation law when she ordered a crew member off a Dec. 5 flight before it took off from New York, forcing the Korean Air plane to return to the gate. Cho, then head of cabin service at the airline, was angered at being offered macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a dish, and she physically confronted the crew in the first-class cabin.\n\nQ: WHO IS CHO HYUN-AH?\n\nA: Cho, 40, is the eldest of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho's three children. After graduating from Hotel Management School at Cornell University, Cho in 1999 joined Korean Air, which was founded by her grandfather. She enjoyed fast-track promotion and became an executive in 2006 at the age of 32. Her paternal grandfather is a member of the first generation of entrepreneurs who helped build the economy from the ashes of Korean War. She is married to a prominent plastic surgeon, who performed his nips and tucks in Gangnam, a tony district of Seoul, and has twin sons.\n\nQ: HOW SERIOUS WERE THE CHARGES?\n\nA: The most serious of the charges was Cho's violation of aviation security law, which prohibits forcing an aircraft to deviate from its planned route. The maximum penalty on that charge was 10 years in prison. Prosecutors called for a total of three years in prison for all the charges, which included assaulting a flight attendant, hindering a government investigation and obstructing flight personnel. The only charge Cho was cleared of was hindering the government's probe.\n\nQ: WHAT CAME OUT IN COURT?\n\nA: Cho and her family ran Korean Air by instilling fear. No criticism was allowed against their prickly management. Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant forced off the plane by Cho, told judges that she treated employees \"like feudal slaves.\" Kim Do-hee, the flight attendant who served macadamia nuts in a bag to Cho, testified that she saw Cho's power at the airline as \"unimaginably big.\" When Cho became furious, she was like a \"beast looking for prey\" and an \"angry tiger,\" according to the testimony of the two flight attendants.\n\nQ: WHY WAS SOUTH KOREA INFURIATED?\n\nA: The incident touched a nerve in South Korea, where the economy is dominated by family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol. Public opinion has turned against the founding families who have tended to treat their sprawling businesses, which employ millions of people, like personal empires. Their crimes, including tax evasion and embezzling company funds, have usually been punished with suspended prison sentences, and they later are wiped from the slate through presidential pardon. The first and second generations of these families were credited with helping to transform South Korea into a developed nation. But the third generation is regarded as pampered and entitled, and the public is less tolerant of their excesses.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE SOUTH KOREANS SAYING ABOUT THE SENTENCE?\n\nA: Jo Young-sang, 24: \"Personally, I think the one-year sentence was a bit short. Recently, issues regarding such behaviours are the talk of the town. I think there will be no improvement in the service industry working environment if conglomerates continue to treat people like this.\"\n\nTeacher Chang Sabine: \"To me, the nut rage incident looked like a rich kid in an elementary school looking down on poor or weak kids. I think she should be doing community service to become mentally matured.\"\n\nQ: WHAT ARE OTHER CHAEBOL CRIMES?\n\nA: Tax evasion, breach of trust and embezzlement are the most frequent chaebol family crimes. Among the chaebol bosses convicted for white collar crimes are Cho's father, Cho Yang-ho, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, Hyundai Motor chairman Chung Mong-koo, Hanwha chairman Kim Seung-youn, SK chairman Chey Tae-won and CJ Group chairman Lee Jay-hyun. Of them, only Chey has been in prison. Bosses at Samsung, Hyundai Motor, Korean Air and Hanhwa received suspended prison terms. In 2007, Hanwha's Kim was found guilty of beating bar workers who scuffled with his then-22-year-old son. Kim's bodyguards took the victims to a construction site near Seoul, where the tycoon kicked and punched them.", "More than 4.6 million digital wearables shipped worldwide last year, according to a report on the young market published Wednesday by analytics firm Canalys. More than 720,000 devices powered by Google's Android Wear wearable operating system were shipped in 2014, with the Motorola Moto 360 smartwatch the clear favorite. The team at Canalys measured shipments of \"smart wearable bands,\" multi-purpose devices designed to be worn on the body, act as accessories to other devices and can run third-party applications.\n\nAfter a few middling releases in 2013, last year saw a broader market with offerings from companies ranging from tech behemoths like Samsung, which essentially released an entire line of smartwatches, and LG to crowd-funded upstarts like Pebble, which has shipped 1 million units since its 2013 launch. Even though the Moto 360 led the Android Wear devices, Samsung is still spearheading the entire market.\n\n\"Samsung has launched six devices in just 14 months on different platforms and still leads the smart band market,\" said Canalys vice president and principal analyst, Chris Jones, in a statement. \"But it has struggled to keep consumers engaged and must work hard to attract developers while it focuses on Tizen for its wearables.\" Tizen is an operating system for digital devices. Samsung's current hold on the market is expected to evaporate, however, when Apple Watch hits store shelves sometime in the coming months. Canalys believes Apple's offering will be the product to kick wearables into the mainstream, much like the company did for tablets when the iPad was released in 2010.\n\n\"Apple made the right decisions with its WatchKit software development kit to maximize battery life for the platform, and the Apple Watch will offer leading energy efficiency,\" claimed Canalys analyst Daniel Matte in a release. \"Android Wear will need to improve significantly in the future, and we believe it will do so.\"", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online.

Analysis revealed that the actual files had been stored locally on the user's Plex media server, but the ads did not pop up on other devices like tablets and smartphones, when accessing the same server.\n\nHowever, Plex took off the blame blanket by claiming that the company had nothing to do with the issue, meaning that the software was the root cause. But Plex offered help by providing the solution, which is to click \"disagree with the Yahoo Privacy Notice,\" an option located deep inside Samsung's Smart Hub options.\n\nOn the same day, many Australian owners of Samsung smart TVs complained of Pepsi ads being shown without consent into their Foxtel (Australian cable TV) programs. The problem only arose on Samsung's smart TVs; no other devices or platforms were affected.\n\nSoon after the frenzy, Samsung Australia released a statement on the issue, claiming the Pepsi ad was the result of an \"error that occurred as part of a recent software update that was not intended for the Australian market.\"\n\n\"We can confirm that the issue has now been rectified and that there are currently no plans to introduce this type of advertising in Australia in the near future,\" the statement said.\n\nSo that means that the company just might be considering to insert ads using this method too, in some markets. This is fueled by the fact that similar ads had started popping up on Samsung's smart TVs in January this year.\n\nThis news reached us shortly after it was discovered that Samsung's smart TV terms and conditions policy has a rather unconventional and sort of immoral rule: anything you say in front of your TV might be relayed to a third party.\n\nHowever, Samsung had quickly buried this under the dust, claiming the TV only sends data to third parties when a user requests a voice command search. But then again, if your TV can display ads on its own it can clearly deliver ad-related data to a third party.", "Watch what you say in your living room. Samsung's smart TV could be listening. And sharing.\n\nVoice recognition technology in the South Korean company's Internet connected TVs can capture and transmit nearby conversations.\n\nThe potential for TVs to eavesdrop is revealed in Samsung's smart TV privacy policy available on its website.\n\n\"Please be aware that if your spoken works include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition,\" the policy said.\n\nFor the voice command feature to work, third party software translates speech into text and sends the command back to the TV.\n\nUsers can give commands to the TV's built-in microphone such as \"find me an action movie,\" which causes the TV to search as instructed. As the TV collects voice commands, it also transmits other information as its individual ID.\n\nSamsung said data collection is aimed at improving TV performance but users can disable it.\n\nIt is not the first time that smart TVs sparked privacy concerns. In 2013, a user revealed that LG Electronics smart TV was sending information about his viewing habits back to the company without consent and without encrypting data.\n\nLG has also experimented with displaying targeted ads on its smart TVs, which requires collecting and utilizing user data, such as their location, age and gender.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

A South Korean court found that she violated aviation law when she ordered a crew member off a Dec. 5 flight before it took off from New York, forcing the Korean Air plane to return to the gate. Cho, then head of cabin service at the airline, was angered at being offered macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a dish, and she physically confronted the crew in the first-class cabin.\n\nQ: WHO IS CHO HYUN-AH?\n\nA: Cho, 40, is the eldest of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho's three children. After graduating from Hotel Management School at Cornell University, Cho in 1999 joined Korean Air, which was founded by her grandfather. She enjoyed fast-track promotion and became an executive in 2006 at the age of 32. Her paternal grandfather is a member of the first generation of entrepreneurs who helped build the economy from the ashes of Korean War. She is married to a prominent plastic surgeon, who performed his nips and tucks in Gangnam, a tony district of Seoul, and has twin sons.\n\nQ: HOW SERIOUS WERE THE CHARGES?\n\nA: The most serious of the charges was Cho's violation of aviation security law, which prohibits forcing an aircraft to deviate from its planned route. The maximum penalty on that charge was 10 years in prison. Prosecutors called for a total of three years in prison for all the charges, which included assaulting a flight attendant, hindering a government investigation and obstructing flight personnel. The only charge Cho was cleared of was hindering the government's probe.\n\nQ: WHAT CAME OUT IN COURT?\n\nA: Cho and her family ran Korean Air by instilling fear. No criticism was allowed against their prickly management. Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant forced off the plane by Cho, told judges that she treated employees \"like feudal slaves.\" Kim Do-hee, the flight attendant who served macadamia nuts in a bag to Cho, testified that she saw Cho's power at the airline as \"unimaginably big.\" When Cho became furious, she was like a \"beast looking for prey\" and an \"angry tiger,\" according to the testimony of the two flight attendants.\n\nQ: WHY WAS SOUTH KOREA INFURIATED?\n\nA: The incident touched a nerve in South Korea, where the economy is dominated by family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol. Public opinion has turned against the founding families who have tended to treat their sprawling businesses, which employ millions of people, like personal empires. Their crimes, including tax evasion and embezzling company funds, have usually been punished with suspended prison sentences, and they later are wiped from the slate through presidential pardon. The first and second generations of these families were credited with helping to transform South Korea into a developed nation. But the third generation is regarded as pampered and entitled, and the public is less tolerant of their excesses.\n\nQ: WHAT ARE SOUTH KOREANS SAYING ABOUT THE SENTENCE?\n\nA: Jo Young-sang, 24: \"Personally, I think the one-year sentence was a bit short. Recently, issues regarding such behaviors are the talk of the town. I think there will be no improvement in the service industry working environment if conglomerates continue to treat people like this.\"\n\nTeacher Chang Sabine: \"To me, the nut rage incident looked like a rich kid in an elementary school looking down on poor or weak kids. I think she should be doing community service to become mentally matured.\"\n\nQ: WHAT ARE OTHER CHAEBOL CRIMES?\n\nA: Tax evasion, breach of trust and embezzlement are the most frequent chaebol family crimes. Among the chaebol bosses convicted for white collar crimes are Cho's father, Cho Yang-ho, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, Hyundai Motor chairman Chung Mong-koo, Hanwha chairman Kim Seung-youn, SK chairman Chey Tae-won and CJ Group chairman Lee Jay-hyun.

A South Korean court found that she violated aviation law when she ordered a crew member off a Dec. 5 flight before it took off from New York, forcing the Korean Air plane to return to the gate. Cho, then head of cabin service at the airline, was angered at being offered macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a dish, and she physically confronted the crew in the first-class cabin.\n\nQ: WHO IS CHO HYUN-AH?\n\nA: Cho, 40, is the eldest of Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho's three children. After graduating from Hotel Management School at Cornell University, Cho in 1999 joined Korean Air, which was founded by her grandfather. She enjoyed fast-track promotion and became an executive in 2006 at the age of 32. Her paternal grandfather is a member of the first generation of entrepreneurs who helped build the economy from the ashes of Korean War. She is married to a prominent plastic surgeon, who performed his nips and tucks in Gangnam, a tony district of Seoul, and has twin sons.\n\nQ: HOW SERIOUS WERE THE CHARGES?\n\nA: The most serious of the charges was Cho's violation of aviation security law, which prohibits forcing an aircraft to deviate from its planned route. The maximum penalty on that charge was 10 years in prison. Prosecutors called for a total of three years in prison for all the charges, which included assaulting a flight attendant, hindering a government investigation and obstructing flight personnel. The only charge Cho was cleared of was hindering the government's probe.\n\nQ: WHAT CAME OUT IN COURT?\n\nA: Cho and her family ran Korean Air by instilling fear. No criticism was allowed against their prickly management. Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant forced off the plane by Cho, told judges that she treated employees \"like feudal slaves.\" Kim Do-hee, the flight attendant who served macadamia nuts in a bag to Cho, testified that she saw Cho's power at the airline as \"unimaginably big.\" When Cho became furious, she was like a \"beast looking for prey\" and an \"angry tiger,\" according to the testimony of the two flight attendants.\n\nQ: WHY WAS SOUTH KOREA INFURIATED?\n\nA: The incident touched a nerve in South Korea, where the economy is dominated by family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol. Public opinion has turned against the founding families who have tended to treat their sprawling businesses, which employ millions of people, like personal empires. Their crimes, including tax evasion and embezzling company funds, have usually been punished with suspended prison sentences, and they later are wiped from the slate through presidential pardon. The first and second generations of these families were credited with helping to transform South Korea into a developed nation.

In its latest version, dubbed Lollipop, which has just started to roll out to older phones and tablets, the look and feel of Android and its primary apps get a major overhaul.\n\nGoogle calls the new look in Android 5.0 \"Material Design.\" It's marked by brighter colors, a \"flatter\" but layered look to applications and icons, and greater emphasis on clear and legible text.\n\nThe new design borrows ideas from the flat look that Apple introduced to its mobile operating system in iOS 7 and the interface Microsoft designed for its Windows Phone software. Android remains distinct from both, but it now appears to be in the same family.\n\nFor example, when you turn on Lollipop's new \"battery saver\" mode, the notification bar at the top of the screen and the taskbar at bottom turn a bright orange. The look is reminiscent of how the notification bar turns green in iOS when you are on a call or blue when you turn on its personal hotspot feature.\n\nSimilarly, many of the Google-designed apps in Lollipop have a unique color in their menu bars that serves to distinguish them from other apps. While Gmail's accent color is red, the one for the contacts app is blue.\n\nThe net result is an operating system that feels less like something designed by engineers for engineers and more like something that is lively, fun and accessible to non-techies.\n\nGoogle made some other design changes in Lollipop. One is to how Android displays open applications when you want to switch between them. In previous versions, when you pressed the \"overview\" button to see which applications you had running, Android would display a vertical list of thumbnail images of those programs. With Lollipop, Android displays them like a carousel, with the app windows stacked one on top of another. I prefer the new look, because it allows you to see more of the open apps at once.\n\nGoogle has also revamped the quick settings feature in Android. It's still available in the notifications area, but it's now accessible by swiping down twice from the top of the screen. It also includes some new settings, such as the ability to turn on a smartphone's hotspot feature or to turn on a device's flash to use it as a flashlight.\n\nTo be sure, Google did more in Lollipop than revamp Android's look. The updated software also includes lots of new features.\n\nAmong them are a greater amount of options and controls for notifications. Android users can now respond to alerts that display on their lock screen. They can turn on a privacy feature that allows notifications to be displayed on the lock screen, but blocks their content, such as the actual message in a text message. And they can turn on a mode that will only display alerts from particular people and apps.\n\nOne of the cool new features of Android is that it gives users more options in how to share their devices with others.\n\nAndroid tablets have been able to support multiple user accounts for a while now. With Lollipop, Android smartphones gain the same ability, allowing consumers to access their own contacts and other data on a friend or family member's phone. Lollipop also adds allows users to create guest accounts on both smartphones and tablets that can access any apps but none of the personal data on them.\n\nOf note for parents, the new software has a related feature that allows users to \"pin\" a particular app to the screen so that a child, say, can't use any other apps or see anything else on the device. That might be helpful if your kid wants to play a game on your phone, but you don't want them to see your email or reconfigure your homescreen.\n\nThese types of features -- support for multiple users and the ability to easily restrict access to younger users -- are ones that I've long wished Apple would build into iOS.\n\nGoogle has also enhanced the security in Android. In Lollipop, encryption is turned on by default; previously, it was hard to know that you could use it to protect your data, because to turn it on, you had to find it deep within the system's settings. While Android's ability for apps to work together fairly seamlessly was a selling point over iOS until recently, it's also been a vulnerability, potentially allowing malware to gain access to important functions on the device.\n\nIn Lollipop, Google limits the access particular programs have to the underlying functions; your apps should still be able to work together, but they should pose a lot less of a threat to functioning of your phone.\n\nAs with any new version of Android, the big questions for users are when they will be able to get the new software and the degree to which phone manufacturers will customize it. Although Lollipop has started to become available to certain Android devices, there are lots that still can't get it. When I tried several days ago to download it to two Android smartphones I've been testing -- Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge and Sharp's Aquos Crystal -- it wasn't available.\n\nMeanwhile, few electronics manufacturers offer an unadulterated Android experience. Unless you have one of Google's Nexus devices, you may not see many of the cool new interface features in Lollipop.\n\nOverall, Lollipop is a sweet new update. With both good looks and cool features, it's well worth downloading if you can get it.", "The first Fonepad premiered in 2013, nearly a year after the game-changing Nexus 7, which Asus made for Google. The Taiwanese got another contract to work on an upgrade and they did well to keep the momentum. Padfones, Fonepads, Memo Pads and Zenfones were soon to join the Transformers in a lineup that's entirely indifferent to phones but offers an impressive variety of phablets and tablets.\n\nThe downside is it can get confusing. The original was simply called the Asus Fonepad. The Fonepad 7 succeeded it, followed by the Fonepad 7 (2104). At that point, Asus ran out of fresh naming ideas and the next generation has the model number in the official brand name. As a result, we're reviewing something a Fonepad 7 FE375CXG.\n\nAsus Fonepad 7 FE375CXG press images\n\nOK, a quick what's what in the Asus portfolio. Transformers are 10\" convertible tablets with a detachable keyboard.\n\nZenfones are tablets and Padfones hybrids: a phone and a docking station with a tablet-sized screen and battery.\n\nAnd finally, the compact tablets. These come in two flavors: Memo Pads are the household version of the Nexus, compact tablets with no voice call support. The Fonepads are the ones you can make network calls on.\n\nOne of the latest additions to the series, the Fonepad 7 FE375CXG is a dual-SIM compact tablet with expandable memory, front and rear cameras and stereo speakers. It's powered by an Intel chip - these are getting more powerful with each generation and yet manage to stay affordable. The one inside the Fonepad 7 is 22nm 64-bit chipset.\n\nThe Fonepad 7 FE375CXG appears bulky but it's not much thicker or heavier than most of its natural rivals. If you're after a tablet you can make calls on, Samsung's Galaxy Tabs are perhaps the most likely alternative. But if it has to have dual-SIM support, the competition is nearly non-existent.\n\nAsus Fonepad 7 FE375CXG live pictures\n\nThe Fonepad series are meant for the developing markets but should be easy to get via local retailers or official Asus distributors in Europe. Affordable, reasonably powered and capable of making calls on two SIM cards, the latest generation Fonepad 7 can get a lot of people interested.", "According to a new rumor, Samsung is already busy working on developing successors to the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 (pictured to the left) and Galaxy Tab S 10.5 tablets that it launched last year. The main standout feature for the existing Galaxy Tab S models is the fact that they both employ Super AMOLED touchscreens, something that had previously been missing from the mobile world for a few years.\n\nThe upcoming tablets will obviously keep the AMOLED technology of their predecessors' displays. The new models will be SM-T710 and SM-T810 (the originals are SM-T700 and SM-T800, respectively).\n\nWhile no other details about the new devices are known at this time, it's safe to assume that they won't get some earth-shattering hardware upgrades. We might see them ship with a new chipset, perhaps Samsung's Exynos 7420 which is expected to make its debut in the Galaxy S6 on March 1.\n\nThat may help the new Tab S generation perform better than the original tablets. We apparently shouldn't expect to see the new Tab S line unveiled at MWC alongside the Galaxy S6, since work on them isn't that advanced yet. They will be announced later, perhaps towards the middle of the year.", "Lola Masha's toothy smile makes her more beautiful. But beyond the fine face is the dogged and fiercely independent business leader. This graduate of Chemical Engineering is the country leader and manager of OLX, one of Nigeria's thriving online business platforms. The mother-of- one honed her business and administrative skills in various companies like Google and Bank PHB. She later moved into consultancy till early 2014 when OLX spotted her and got her on board to lead its firm in Nigeria. And together with her team, Mrs. Marsha was poised to push online marketing outfit. She spoke with Vera Wisdom-Bassey on issues that border on the prospect of online business, life as a business leader and other matters.\n\nExcerpt...\n\nW\n\nhy did you delve into online business instead of being a chemical engineer that you studied in school?\n\nI tell people not to be too focused on things they should be doing. Rather they should just do what they enjoy, and know that there is no learning that is transferable. I've also been into consultancy and I have even worked in banking. The key thing is to do your best, to move the business forward.\n\nSo, what is OLX all about?\n\nOLX stands for an On Line Exchange. So far, the journey has been so good. I have been at OLX for a year, and the business has grown tremendously in terms of number of users. And we look forward to even establishing and cementing our vision of being number one online transacter.\n\nThe key thing that stands us out is that we are creating a business environment, where individuals can use our online platform to convert items like furniture, toys, electronics to cash. There are lots of stories that have really touched our hearts. There's this story of a guy who got a visa to travel outside the country, but do not have the money for the flight ticket. But he was able to raise money by selling some household items through our website. He sold his used car, I-pad and some other items before he secured enough money to purchase a ticket.\n\nHow do you manage this brand in the face of the fierce competition from other online business platforms in the country today?\n\nThe important thing is the method, need and service that you provide. What OLX provides is a platform for individuals to trade. Trade has existed since the beginning of time, where users buy and sell among each other, what OLX is doing is giving you the online platform and website that allows you to do that. Other website only sell brand new items, but OLX is one of the websites where people can sell used items like car, utensils, etc.\n\nWhat does it take to market items on an online business platform like OLX?\n\nIs a very simple process, all you have to do is to take pictures of the items you want to sell, list the price and description of those items, then you post it. Our teams at OLX will reveal those items to see if it meets our quality before it goes online for sale. OLX does not fix the price, it is the seller or owner of the item that fixes the price the item would be sold online.\n\nHow would you rate the prospects of online business in Nigeria?\n\nThe potentials of the online world are tremendous. I have no doubt about it. We have seen several countries grow in the last few years. If you look at some countries outside Nigeria, you'll realise that they have recorded immense growth in their economy, because their populace tap into the internet. I see that trend happening in Nigeria as well, because we are partnering to increase internet penetration.\n\nThere are many advantages to doing business online. Nigeria's huge population implies access to a huge customer base. Also, online businesses allow one to fulfil your needs and wants wherever you are and whenever you want to. The boundaries are truly limitless as long as innovation and customer satisfaction are the guiding values.\n\nE-commerce is capable of changing people's lives for the better in Nigeria. Not only are online companies employing large numbers of people, e-commerce also allows people to make an honest living where previously there have been few options.\n\nAs infrastructure get better and the population becomes savvier, e-commerce is going to play a huge role in growing the economy and giving the average man more access to wealth.\n\nHow would you advise individuals that aspire to tap into online businesses?\n\nThe key thing is having clarity on the exact business module of what you're trying to achieve. Ensure you don't get distracted, but focus on the business module. Endeavour to test and try it out before you set up your online business. Then constantly try to evolve the business, with the idea, and make sure it works.\n\nBut do you think Nigeria is right for this internet market?\n\nAbsolutely, I think it's much easier to be successful doing businesses online rather than off line. It requires less structure and less capital to get your business going. All you need is your connector, a laptop and some lectures on how to use the website. Off line business requires, maybe a shop and hiring people to assist build up a business.\n\nThen continuously learn how to use the twitter, find ways to grow your expertise, how to effectively use new tools in technology. And then get started, and once you do, keep at it and keep finding ways to manage it and grow it.\n\nHow do you manage your time, as a mother, career person and wife?\n\nThe key thing is to provide staff members with an empowering environment where they can work freely. Then delegating some duties and making sure every staffer does his/her job well. We normally have a very brainy and stormy session, where we address our common challenges to ensure we promote the right culture within OLX. And to make it where other people would aspire to come and work.\n\nAlso, I have a very supportive and understanding husband. In addition, the business allows me to properly balance my career and family. So, if I need to leave early for any family emergency the work allows me to do that. We encourage and want to provide a working environment that supports women and men to balance their family lives in the work places.\n\n23 yrs boy started importation with N10,450.

Must be joking", "The State Bank of Vietnam's HCMC branch has provided more than VND40 trillion (US$1.87 billion) for banks in the city to meet the cash withdrawal demand of local companies and residents during the Lunar New Year holiday (Tet).\n\nNguyen Hoang Minh, deputy director of the branch, said the huge amount of money is for companies to withdraw for their production plans and wage and bonus payments as well as for the spending needs of individuals during the biggest annual holiday in the country.\n\nMinh told the Daily that liquidity of the HCMC-based banks is ample and that they have prepared contingency plans to respond to a sudden rise in cash withdrawals ahead of Tet, which begins on February 19.\n\nThe central bank has told local banks to guarantee sufficient cash supplies for all their automated teller machines (ATMs) in the city, Minh said. However, he suggested enterprises not transfer Tet bonuses to their employees' banking accounts in the last minute to prevent possible massive withdrawals.\n\nIn the past days, workers have queued up in long lines in front of ATMs at export processing zones (EPZs) and industrial parks (IPs) on the city's outskirts to withdraw cash.\n\nLe Huynh Ha, head of the ATM service department of the HCMC branch of the Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (Vietcombank), said the demand for cash withdrawals in recent days has doubled on normal days and may triple in the days to come. So, people will have to wait long to get cash.\n\nHowever, Ha said cash withdrawal pressure at ATMs will be lower this year than last year as many companies at IPs and EPZs have stopped operations for the Tet break.\n\nHa said banks cannot install more ATMs in the city because the number of active machines is enough for the daily demand on normal days as it is expensive to install new machines.\n\nA source from the central bank's Banking Supervision and Inspection Agency told the Daily that the agency has sent out eight inspection teams to check banks' management of their ATM operations but have detected no problems so far. But it is tough to check all the 3,700 ATMs throughout the city.\n\nIn some cases, the agency is informed of ATMs out of cash but when it dispatches inspectors to these machines, banks have taken one step ahead to refill them with cash already.\n\nDecree 96/2014/ND-CP with effect from last year regulates banks will be fined VND10-15 million if any of their ATMs runs out of cash. But no banks have been fined so far.\n\nOV help sought to boost farm exports\n\nVietnam needs help from overseas Vietnamese (OV) entrepreneurs to export more rice, fruit and seafood meeting international standards, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat said.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with OV business people in HCMC on Monday, Phat said the country could produce international-standard agricultural items but had long exported mainly semi-processed products at low prices due to difficulties in finding markets.\n\nPhat said Vietnam's annual rice output has jumped by one million tons and the volumes of tra fish, thanh long (dragon fruit) and other farm produce have risen in recent years.\n\n\"Farmers can increase their yields if they find good markets. So we expect you to help export agricultural products to more markets,\" Phat said.\n\nVietnamese-Canadian Dinh Kim Nguyet said Vietnamese agricultural product exporters would have many opportunities to tap into this North American market and earn more profit if they meet food safety criteria.\n\nNguyet said a mango and a hand of bananas cost some C$30 and C$40 respectively, which are much higher than in Vietnam.\n\nVu Thi Mai, a Vietnamese entrepreneur in Russia, said Russian consumers prefer tropical fruit including from Vietnam, but enterprises find it hard to earn profit when selling to Russia due to high transport cost. The main reason is that Vietnamese fruit must be transported by air with an average charge of around US$6 per kilogram.\n\nMai proposed Vietnam improve post-harvest technology to lengthen the storage of fruit for export to the markets far from Vietnam.\n\nPhat said the ministry is working with Japanese companies for post-harvest technology transfer to keep fruit and vegetables fresh longer.\n\n\"We have been aware of post-harvest shortcomings for years and expect that these will be addressed soon,\" Phat said.\n\nThe minister pledged simple administrative procedures and favorable conditions for investors in the agricultural sector.\n\nMore time sought for Uber partners to complete procedures\n\nUber has requested the Ministry of Transport to give its partners more time to complete procedures for the car-sharing service in Vietnam in accordance with the current regulations.\n\nThe company made the request nearly two weeks after the HCMC Department of Transport announced that it would inspect nine partners of Uber in the coming weeks.\n\nUber explained its transport partners needed time to complete relevant procedures, including registering for the Uber signboard which requires one to three days. Therefore, the company proposed the ministry allow its partners which are completing procedures to continue providing the service.\n\nThe contracts signed between Uber drivers and passengers are a must as clarified in the Government's Decree 86 and the drivers should show the original copies of the contracts or their scanned copies when they are asked by competent agencies. However, Uber said a paper-based contract is unnecessary because it is struck online between the driver and the passenger.\n\nOn February 5, HCMC vice chairman Hua Ngoc Thuan told relevant agencies to inspect and fine individuals and companies failing to meet requirements for the car-sharing service in the city.\n\nInspectors of the HCMC Department of Transport checked Uber taxi drivers from November 28 last year to January 7 this year, and fined 19 cases a total of over VND79 million (US$3,702).\n\nAs of January 16, competent agencies had detected 17 more violators and imposed fines of VND91.3 million as they failed to meet criteria for transport license, signboard, contract and GPS device, among others.\n\nEximbank gets approval for mPOS service\n\nThe Vietnam Export Import Commercial Bank (Eximbank) has been allowed by the State Bank of Vietnam to provide mobile points of sale (mPOS) service and issue electronic receipts for customers of this service.\n\nThe central bank told Eximbank to follow regulations on payment and backup services for bank cards and meet conditions for the mPOS device under the central bank's rules on technical and security requirements for card payment devices.\n\nIn addition, Eximbank must keep its clients' personal information confidential and take measures to prevent and deal with risks as per prevailing regulations.\n\nThe bank has to clarify rights and responsibilities of the parties concerned in transactions as well as solve customers' complaints, if any.\n\nApart from Eximbank, other banks like VietinBank, TPBank and Sacombank have been cleared to provide the mPOS service.\n\nTextile firms face high turnover\n\nLunar New Year (Tet) celebrations may again prove disruptive to the textile industry as companies have previously found it difficult to get employees back to work after the holiday.\n\nWhile having no problem securing contracts from customers, some companies couldn't muster enough manpower to deliver.\n\nSome had gone so far as to hold onto part of workers' year bonus to force them to return. Textile industry unions have since put an end to the practice, however, saying that companies must pay workers full year bonus before Tet.\n\nTet season also brings with it a surge in demand for temporary workers to meet demanding end-of-year orders. The pay for such temporary jobs can be significantly higher, tempting quite a few workers to leave their regular jobs to make quick money.\n\nAfter Tet is also a time when workers look for new beginnings and better jobs elsewhere. In recent years, competition amongst textile companies to attract and keep more of their labour force has increased.\n\nDirector General of the Viet Nam Textile Group, Le Tien Truong, said in 2015 the textile industry will require more than 3 million workers. Without a sound strategy to maintain a low turn-over rate, Vietnamese textile companies will have a hard time finding enough labour to fulfill their contracts.\n\nCompanies must pay more attention to establishing labour policies that improve workers' benefits such as better compensation practices, better working environments and supporting a robust social life outside of work, said the Truong.\n\nBui Thi Thu, deputy general director of the Phong Phu Corporation, a company that had 100 per cent of their workers return after previous Tet holidays, said the company hosted sports and cultural events on a regular basis as part of a strategy to retain its labour force.\n\nPhong Phu Corporation even started a housing project for their workers. Workers can either purchase apartments for a discounted price or may rent one from the company at a reduced rate.\n\nMonths before this year's Tet, the Thang Loi Textile Corporation started planning how to transport the company's 1,200 workers to their distant hometowns and back for the holiday.\n\nFor workers who chose not to go home for Tet, the company has planned new-year events and activities to keep the holiday spirit.\n\nGarment 10 Corporation, one of the largest textile companies in Viet Nam with more 10,000 workers in the industry, has started looking for new solutions to the industry's poor turn-over rate.\n\nDeputy Director General of Garment 10, Than Duc Viet, said that besides improving workers' income and living conditions, the company is accepting that turnover is inevitable and looking to reduce the required training time for new employees.\n\nViet said with new training methods, it can take as little at one to three months to produce a skilled textile worker. Such measures were taken, he said, to insulate the company's production capacity from major shifts in the labour market.\n\nState budget suffered deficit in January due to holiday allocation\n\nWith expenditures outweighing revenue for the January State budget, the month recorded a deficit of around VND13.3 trillion (US$625 million), reported Vietstock, an onnline financial newspaper.\n\nA Finance Ministry report cited a few reasons for the deficit, one being the ministry's early allocation of funds to keep Government institutions and organisations running through the holiday season.\n\nAdditionally, the Government distributed pensions and other benefits for February early so as to arrive with its beneficiaries in time for the Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday.\n\nIn January, the State budget raked in VND81.3 trillion ($3.82 billion), up 9.2 per cent over the revenue recorded last January.\n\nDomestic sources of revenue accounted for VND62.1 trillion ($2.87 billion) of the intake, equal to 9.7 per cent of the yearly domestic revenue. The figure was higher than the target of average 8.3 per cent per month set by the Government.\n\nJanuary revenues collected from production and business saw increases from the levels of the same period last year, registering an 18 per cent rise in the State sector; a 7.2 per cent hike in the sector with foreign investment and a 6.8 per cent climb in the non-State industrial and commercial sector.\n\nThe unexpected increase in January's revenue has been attributed to a series of positive economic developments seen in late 2014 and early 2015, according to the report.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2014 registered a growth in GDP by 6.96 per cent, and so far 2015 has also shown some promising macroeconomic growth.\n\nCompared to January of last year, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rose by 17.5 per cent, and retail and service revenues increased by 13 per cent. Both numbers are testament to reports of a healthy national economy.\n\nBesides the pre-Tet expenditures, the VND94.6 trillion ($4.44 billion) spent in January went primarily to socio-economic development projects, national defence and security, as well as State administration and debt servicing.\n\nJW Marriott wins International Hotel Awards\n\nThe JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi is today celebrating after being named, 'Best Hotel and Best Convention Hotel in Vietnam' at the International Hotel Awards - the hospitality industry's most prestigious awards.\n\nThe luxurious 5-star accommodation joined other high profile Vietnamese hotels such as the Vinpearl Luxury Hotel Danang, at a glittering ceremony in London to receive the highly acclaimed accolade.\n\nThe 2015 UK Hotel Awards, often referred to as the Oscars of hotel awards, aim to recognise excellence in the hotel and hospitality industry worldwide to promote an international standard.\n\nAttaining one of these coveted awards is irrefutable evidence that both the JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi and the Vinpearl Luxury Hotel Danang are capable of competing against exceedingly strong contenders within the highly competitive international hospitality arena.\n\n\"These award wins are attributed to the managers and associates of JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi. If there is one area that I am most proud of it is our team, our managers and associates,\" said Bob Fabiano, general manager of JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi.\n\nFabiano added that it is their skill and dedication to our guests and fellow associates that allows JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi to be recognised as a leading preferred hotel in Vietnam and Asia.\n\nIndian enterprises seek investment opportunities in Quang Binh\n\nThe Quang Binh People's Committee and the Indian Association of MCHI CREDAI Navi Mumbai said that they would jointly organise a conference titled \"Quang Binh's great potential and business opportunities for Indian enterprises from Mumbai\" next June.\n\nThe announcement came after a meeting between the Quang Binh authorities and representatives from MCHI CREDAI Navi Mumbai led by Satish Sablhok. At least 50 enterprises from India are expected to attend the event.\n\nQuang Binh authorities took the occasion to introduce the province's potential, advantages, mechanisms, and practical preferential and support policies to Indian investors.\n\nThe province also recommended high-performing sectors or projects to Indian investors, such as the Bac Bao Ninh urban area; the Bao Ninh eco-tourism park; the Bao Ninh high-end resort; the Quang Ninh hi-tech electronics park; the Hon La 2 industrial park; and the Le Thuy seaport industrial park.\n\nNguyen Xuan Quang, Standing Vice Chairman of the Quang Binh People's Committee, said that the province will work to provide favourable conditions to attract investors from India.\n\nSupermarket sales surge as Tet nears\n\nSupermarkets in HCM City report a sharp increase in sales in recent days and expect a further rise a few days ahead of Tet (Lunar New Year), which falls on February 19 this year.\n\nCo.opmart, for instance, said sales was up by three to four times compared to normal days, especially of confectionery, beverages, cosmetics, and dried food.\n\nDemand for priced-stabilised items like rice, sugar, cooking oil, and eggs and discounted products and processed foods is 60% higher than the supermarket had planned for.\n\nIt expects sales to rise further from now through the New Year, especially of fresh food such as pork, beef, poultry meat, fruits and vegetables, pork pies, glutinous rice cakes, and pickled vegetables.\n\nVo Hoang Anh, marketing director of Saigon Co.op, which owns the supermarket, said Co.opmart, Co.opXtra, and Co.opFood stores have stocked large quantities of fruits like watermelon, custard apple, dragon fruit, Hoa Loc mango, and pomelo to meet demand.\n\nThe fruits are cheaper than market prices, he said, adding that their quality is also carefully controlled to ensure there are no chemical residues.\n\nHo Quoc Nguyen, director of public relations at Big C, said the number of shoppers at the French supermarket chain was up three-fold last week.\n\nIn the run-up to Tet, especially during weekend and just before the New Year, the number of shoppers would surely increase further, he said, adding that sales this year would be 15% higher than last year.\n\nThree weeks ahead of Tet, gift baskets, confectionery, jams, beers, beverages, household utensils, and decorative items are among the most popular items. In the next few days buyers would focus on fresh items like fruits and vegetables, livestock and poultry meat, and seafood, he said.\n\nThe supermarket has abundant stocks of fresh food, fruits, vegetables, and other items, he said.\n\nYesterday, it began selling unusual fruits for display during Tet - such as square watermelons, gold bar-shaped watermelons, red pineapples, and wine gourd pomelos. Lotte Mart, sales is up 40% now and is expected to rise to 60% in the coming days, according to Tran Pham Phuc Nguyen, marketing director of the Korean-owned supermarket.\n\nFruits, vegetables, watermelons, mangoes, glutinous rice cakes, fresh flowers, confectionery, and jams are most in demand, it said, adding that Tet gift baskets also sold very well, with over 1,500 baskets snapped up so far.\n\nNguyen said the prices of goods have not increased for Tet, and the supermarket also has promotions to enable shoppers to save more.\n\nAs part of a promotion programme in the run-up to the Lunar New Year, Co.opmart chain is selling watermelons, scallops, Da Lat potatoes, white cabbages, onions, sausages, biscuits, and detergents at VND5,000 to VND30,000 lower than market prices until February 18.\n\nIt is also slashing prices by up to 50% on 4,500 products until the last day of this lunar year.\n\nBig C too is offering discounts of 5-45% on more than 2,000 products until February 18.\n\nBesides, shoppers buying goods worth more than VND500,000 (US$23.4) will enter its lucky draw.\n\nSimilarity, Lotte Mart is offering attractive discounts on thousands of items until February 18.\n\nTo meet the Tet rush, many supermarkets have extended their opening hours as well as increased the number of cashiers to ensure convenience and safety during the country's grandest festival.\n\nSamsung begins evaluating suppliers\n\nSamsung Electronics has started meeting with potential Vietnamese suppliers in the Hanoi and surrounding region and is running through the checklists evaluating their qualifications.\n\nSamsung's purchasing manager, Jang Hoyoung said the company is currently meeting with roughly 20 suppliers that have returned completed application forms.\n\nEarlier in September 2014, Samsung organised a seminar in Hanoi to meet with potential suppliers Hoyoung said, adding that the company plans to hold another one before June in hopes of negotiating final contracts and jumpstarting manufacturing as soon as practical.\n\nBinh Duong companies report strong performances\n\nBusinesses in the Thuan An and Di An townships of the southern province of Binh Duong reported quick recovery following the incidence in May 2014 during a visit by provincial officials on February 11.\n\nGolf club head maker Vision International Co. Ltd, located in the VSIP 1 Industrial Park in Thuan An, earned 40 million USD in revenue last year, its General Director Sir Jimmy told Vice Chairman of the provincial People's committee Tran Thanh Liem.\n\nHe said thanks to assistance from local authorities, the firm was able to resume and expand its operations after disruptions from worker disturbances protesting China's placement of an oil rig in Vietnamese waters in mid-May of last year.\n\nThe Taiwanese company has raised workers' wages in line with the State's policy and granted higher Lunar New Year bonus than last year, the executive said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dong Hung Industrial Joint Stock Company in the Tan Dong Hiep A Industrial Park was also able to rapidly stabilise its activities following protest disruption, General Director Ha Duy Hung reported.\n\nThe firm manufactured 10.73 million pairs of footwear in 2014, a 22.1 percent annual increase, and earned over 1.71 trillion VND (80 million USD) in revenue. The company employed 10,000 workers with an average monthly salary of 7.25 million VND (345 USD), a yearly increase of 12 percent, he noted.\n\nVice Chairman Liem commended the enterprises' efforts in developing production and improving employees' livelihood, which has helped boost Binh Duong's economic growth.\n\nHe assured them that local authorities will work to create favourable conditions for their operations.\n\nBinh Duong, which is located in the southern key economic region, attracted the fourth largest FDI amount in 2014 with 19.98 billion USD, following HCM City, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, and Dong Nai, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment's Foreign Investment Agency.-\n\nHa Nam's trade villages busy for Tet\n\nTrade villages in the northern province of Ha Nam are bustling with activity for the upcoming Lunar New Year (Tet) festival.\n\nThe most famous of the craft villages numbering hundreds are Dam village and Phu Van flower village in Phu Ly city, and Dai Hoang village in Ly Nhan district.\n\nDai Hoang is an ancient village in the Hoa Cau commune of Ly Nhan district. It is known for its famous poached dish served in clay pots, which is highly sought-after during Tet.\n\nThe braised fish, which has \"solid meat but soft bones\", is a village specialty.\n\nAccording to villagers, the fish must be cooked in earthenware pots from central Nghe An or Thanh Hoa province to make the dish correctly. The juice added to the pot must be made from ground freshwater crab following a recipe passed down through generations.\n\nSpecifications are even made about the cooking fire; the wood should be sourced from longan trees to ensure the unique flavour resulting from a half day of simmering.\n\nThe key is to mix the ingredients and adjust the fire just right to allow the fish to simmer for 14 to 16 hours. Experienced cooks can tell how much water is left in the pot just by listening to the sound of it boiling and whether it's salty enough just by smelling it.\n\nThe dish has brought fame to the village, becoming very popular across Vietnam. Today, many of the villagers are involved in this trade, selling their product in domestic and international markets.\n\nIn last days of the lunar year, people in Dam village in Phu Ly city are feverishly cooking Chung Cake - a typical savoury cake for the Lunar New Year festival - to meet domestic consumption and export during the largest holiday of the year.\n\nDam is famous for its traditional Chung Cake, made from sticky rice, green beans, and pork. The trade turns the village into a popular destination for connoisseurs.\n\nHoang Van Hien, a villager, said Dam village's Chung makers only use Hai Hau sticky rice and high-quality green beans for the cake, which is then boiled in rainwater.\n\nLocals said the village boils cakes every day from the 15th until the 30th day of the last lunar month. Thousands of cakes are brought to the market each day.\n\nAs in other craft villages, the famous Phu Van flower village has an exciting atmosphere as Tet nears.\n\nTraders from different localities nationwide are flocking to the village to find flowers for Tet, while locals busy themselves caring for the flowers.\n\nPhu Van is the flower hub for Ha Nam and the neighbouring provinces of Nam Dinh, Ninh Binh, and Thai Binh.\n\nThe village is also well-known for its kumquat trees, valued at millions of VND.\n\nAlmost all trade villages in Ha Nam have vibrant atmospheres in anticipation of the New Year. The boost in business contributes to generating stable jobs for a large number of local labourers and improving local income.\n\nBa Ria-Vung Tau pepper cultivation goes green\n\nTrees producing the quintessential pepper spice cultivated in Ba Ria-Vung Tau have improved both in quality and yield, as announced at a workshop held in the southern province on February 11.\n\nThe positive result stemmed from a development project focusing on a sustainable pepper supply chain, jointly organised by the provincial Department for Agriculture and Rural Development and the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation and funded by Olam Vietnam Ltd., the leading exporter of agriculture products, including pepper in Vietnam.\n\nThe project, implemented from 2013-2015, aims to assist 100 producers to meet the Sustainable Agriculture Standards; to establish direct links between Olam and producers; and to set a solid foundation for future market expansion.\n\nAt the workshop, Head of the provincial Rural Development Sub-Division Nguyen Anh Quoc pointed to a number of measures to expand green farming in the future, such as promoting the trademark of local pepper, broadening relevant training courses across the province, and boosting the performance of the provincial pepper association.\n\nAccording to Quoc, pepper plantations in Ba Ria-Vung Tau currently cover 9,047 hectares, producing 2 tonnes per hectare annually. By 2020, the province targets to limit plantations to 8,300 hectares, but improve yields and bring them up to 2.3 tonnes per hectare annually.\n\nAdministrative units from the local agriculture sector warned farmers not to expand their plantations outside officially planned areas, he added.\n\nRitutapan Neog, Deputy General Manager at Olam International, said the company has made sustainable cultivation methods available for more than 104 farms in the province to date, 98 of which meet criteria to receive the Rainforest Alliance certification designed to generate ecological, social and economic benefits.\n\nAccording to the SNV, the global market price of pepper has been on the rise over the past few years due to an increase in global demand of the product and a reduction of pepper.\n\nVietnamese pepper accounts for around 30 percent and 50 percent of the world's total production and exports, respectively.-\n\nVASEP: seafood exports to RoK expected to soar\n\nThere will be a lot of opportunities for Vietnam to export its seafood products to the Republic of Korea once the free trade agreement between the two countries is signed in 2015, according to the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP).\n\nThe agreement stipulates that Vietnam will enjoy numerous preferential treatments, including tariff reductions for agricultural, seafood, apparel, and mechanical engineering products.\n\nThis is the first time the RoK has opened its market to \"highly sensitive\" products, including shrimp, fish, cuttlefish and octopus from overseas.\n\nThe RoK is the fifth biggest importer of Vietnamese shrimp, behind the US, Japan, the European Union, and China.\n\nShrimp exports to the country brought Vietnam 317.8 million USD in 2014, a 41.3 percent increase from 2013.\n\nThe RoK has become one of the three top destinations for Vietnamese cuttlefish and octopus with a substantial 26.5 percent growth in 2014, especially with export revenue in the second quarter soaring by 58 percent from the same period in 2013.\n\nVietnamese enterprises now consider the RoK a stable market for Vietnamese seafood products.\n\nThe expanding number of craft villages nationwide has increased environmental pollution, and addressing the issue requires strong communal engagement.\n\nA majority 70% of the country's craft villages are concentrated in the north, with the highest density in the Red River Delta region which suffers from substantial pollution concerns.\n\nLow environmental knowledge and bad management lie at the root of the issue. Local officials in charge of monitoring pollution are poorly informed, leading to apathy and rampant violations. Although all localities have a loose agenda for sustainable growth in craft villages by 2020, the non-specific and unenforced plans are unlikely to take effect.\n\nBased on research of the pressing issue, the Institute of Human Geography considers mobilizing public involvement and support to be the most promising initiative.\n\nAccordingly, the centre suggests establishing relevant legal frameworks and mobilization mechanisms for human and financial resources from the communities, outlining detailed sustainable models suitable for each village, and intensifying the implementation of green campaigns.\n\nVietnam is home to nearly 3,000 craft villages, including 240 traditional villages. The market generates jobs for 11 million people.''\n\nHCM City ATMs run out of money\n\nOffice workers were unable to withdraw cash from ATMs following payment and Tet bonuses over the weekend.\n\nNguyen Thi Ngoc, an office worker in HCM City's District 3, said her local ATM had run out of money, so she had to use an ATM in District 10.\n\nShe said that ATMs often ran out of money over the weekend when banks were closed, leading to questions about whether banks should be punished for the problem.\n\nNguyen Dinh Quy, director of Eximbank's Centre for ATM Cards, said that demand for cash had increased after workers received their salaries and bonuses ahead of the Tet holiday.\n\nHe said that his bank planned to double the amount of cash available at each ATM from VND900 million ($42,850) to VND1.8 billion ($85,700).\n\nDang Cong Hoan, director of Techcombank's Centre for Cards and Individual Finance Services, said the bank and its branches would arrange for staff to be available during Tet to help clients with their problems.\n\nIn recent years, the Government and the State Bank of Viet Nam have encouraged people to use cards for payments. Commercial banks have also issued promotions and preferential policies for clients who use cards for purchases and services.\n\nAccording to the Department of Payment under the State Bank of Viet Nam, during the fourth quarter of last year, ATM transactions reached VND311 trillion ($14.8 billion) and POS transactions hit VND41.3 trillion ($1.96 billion), an increase of 6.2 and 17.9 per cent over the previous quarter. However, 80 per cent of ATM transactions were cash withdrawals.\n\nThere are now nearly 80 million bank accounts and 16,000 ATMs in the country, but ATMs will be overloaded if just 10 per cent of users withdraw cash at the same time.\n\nDeputy Governor of the State Bank of Viet Nam Dao Minh Tu said that commercial banks would be fined VND10-15 million ($476-714) if their ATMs did not have sufficient funds over the New Year.\n\nHowever, customers should remain patient as each ATM could only hold a fixed amount of cash, he said.\n\nState economic groups need 'vitality'\n\nVietnamese economic groups must develop brands at regional levels and act as a growth driver for the economy, said experts from the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM).\n\nThey added that restructuring of State-owned enterprises should focus on key economic sectors.\n\nBui Van Dung, head of the Enterprises' Reform and Development Department, said at a press conference early this week that the development of economic groups must possess a new \"vitality\".\n\nDung stressed that market dominance of economic groups must be placed under better control.\n\nThe department brought up three scenarios for the development of Vietnamese economic groups, in terms of two growth indicators: average revenue growth rate and average labour growth rate.\n\nIn all the three scenarios, the growth rate for average revenue is projected to reach its peak during the 2018 to 2019 period.\n\nAverage revenue is forecast to jump 15.79 per cent, 14.23 per cent and 12.68 per cent during 2014 to 2020 period, for the best, medium and worst development scenarios, respectively.\n\nRegarding labour growth, labour cuts will occur during the 2014 to 2016 period, but gradually improve after that.\n\nDung said the medium scenario would have the greatest feasibility and will apply to both State-owned and private economic groups, given the economy's competitiveness and existing instabilities.\n\nHowever, there will be differences in the State and private sectors, Dung said, pointing out that the operation of SOEs have remained dominant due to the modest number of private economic groups.\n\nData showed that total charter capital for the biggest private economic groups is only equivalent to 15.5 per cent of the eight biggest State-owned economic groups.\n\nState-owned economic groups have been revealed to hold dominant shares in many sectors, such as fertiliser production, coal exploitation, electricity generation and insurance.\n\nHowever, experts said the private sector has better operational efficiency and financial safety.\n\nThe return on equity (ROE) for the 20 biggest private economic groups was 8.45 per cent in 2012 and 12.72 per cent in 2013, in comparison with 5.28 and 7.3 per cent for State-owned firms, respectively.\n\nAccording to Nguyen Dinh Cung, there is little opportunity for State-owned economic groups to develop further if they remain closed to outside capital sources.\n\nCung added that State-owned economic groups should attract outside stakeholders to lower risks and costs.\n\nExperts added that economic groups and the domestic market, must develop brands of an international standard to boost development\n\nInt'l investments top $1.7b in 2014\n\nVietnamese businesses invested more than US$1.78 billion abroad last year, according to the Planning and Investment Ministry's Foreign Investment Agency (FIA).\n\nOf this figure, more than $1 billion came from 109 newly-licensed projects, while the remainder came from 22 operating projects, which ramped up their levels of capital, the FIA said, describing Viet Nam's investments abroad last year as a positive development, even as the domestic economy is still encountering several challenges.\n\nDuring the reviewed period, the investments were focused on 28 countries and territories.\n\nAmong them, Tanzania was the leading investment destination for Vietnamese investors, in terms of registered capital and accounted for 34 per cent of Viet Nam's total overseas investment capital. It was followed by Cambodia at 31.1 per cent and Burundi at 16.2 per cent.\n\nWith 23 projects, Cambodia had the largest number, accounting for 21 per cent of Viet Nam's total overseas investment projects. Singapore is next with 16 projects or 14.7 per cent, while Laos and the United States ranked third and fourth with 13 projects or 12 per cent and 12 projects or 11 per cent, respectively.\n\nAmong the largest projects are two telecommunications network projects, being invested in by Viettel in Tanzania and Burundi, which involve a combined capital of $525.2 million; a An Dong Mia Co's rubber plantation project in Cambodia, capitalised at $80.4 million and three others in Cambodia with capital totalling $190 million.\n\nAs of the end of last year, Vietnamese foreign investment topped $19.78 billion and approximately $6 billion or 30.6 per cent of the total capital has been disbursed.\n\nA maximum disbursement capital of $2.9 billion was invested in the oil and gas sector, followed by over $660 million in agriculture, forestry and the fishing industry; $500 million in the hydroelectric sector; $450.6 million in the ICT industry, as well as $230 million in the finance, banking and insurance areas.\n\nThe agency has forecast that Vietnamese businesses will invest an additional $1.5 to 2 billion abroad this year.\n\nSeafood exporters expect benefits from FTA\n\nThe signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between Viet Nam and South Korea will help Vietnamese seafood companies export their products to South Korea, according to the Viet Nam Association for Seafood Export and Processing (VASEP).\n\nUnder the FTA, South Korea will reduce taxes and offer additional opportunities for industrial and agricultural products exported from Viet Nam including fruits, textile and garment products and mechanical products. South Korea will also import Viet Nam's fishery products including shrimp, fish, squid and octopus.\n\nVietnamese seafood producers have many advantages due to their experiences in processing and exporting fishery products to Japan as well as South Korea, according to VASEP, which also said that Vietnamese consumers had similar tastes as South Koreans when it came to these products.\n\nIn 2015, Viet Nam foresees problems in exporting fishery products to the US and Japan, so the FTA with South Korea is especially critical.\n\nSouth Korea is now the fourth-largest importer of Vietnamese seafood and consumes the fifth-largest quantity of Vietnamese shrimp after the US, Japan, EU and China. Viet Nam surpassed China to become the top shrimp supplier for South Korea after its shrimp exports to South Korea reached US$317.8 million in 2014, an increase of 41.3 per cent over 2013.\n\nSouth Korea was also one of the three largest markets for Vietnamese squid and octopus in 2014, with exports increasing 26.5 per cent over the previous year. Viet Nam's squid and octopus exports in 2014 decreased by only 1.3 per cent on the year in January and rose by 3 to 58 per cent in the next 11 months. Notably in the second quarter last year, squid and octopus exports increased by 45 to 58 per cent over the same period in 2013.\n\nSouth Korea is now a stable market for Viet Nam's fishery sector, especially as its own fishery business is experiencing a short halt, according to the association.\n\nBanks urged to cut interest rates\n\nIt is necessary to further cut interest rates on long- and medium-term loans to enable companies to expand and invest in equipment and technology, the HCM City People's Committee has said.\n\nIts vice chairwoman, Nguyen Thi Hong, said at a recent meeting with local bankers that banks' interest rates are always the focus of the corporate sector's attention especially as they made plans to step up investment and modernise technologies and equipment.\n\nAccording to the HCM City Enterprises Association, the current interest rates on medium- and long-term loans given to most small and medium-sized businesses in the city are 12-14 per cent.\n\nThese are much higher than in other countries in the region. For instance, in Thailand now they are only 5-6 per cent.\n\nIn HCM City, interest rates for priority sectors are around 7 per cent for short-term loans, 8-10 per cent for medium-term loans and 9.5-11 per cent for long-term loans.\n\nAnalysts said that such rates make it very difficult for domestic firms to compete with their overseas peers, whose products have recently flooded the country thanks to the very low import tariffs as part of free trade agreements.\n\nInflation this year is forecast to be pretty low at just 3-4 per cent, creating favourable conditions for the banking sector to slash interest rates.\n\nOn January 27 the State Bank of Viet Nam announced its monetary policy for this year through a directive, instructing lenders to stabilise interest rates and further cut them for medium- and long-term loans by 1-1.5 per cent.\n\nThe directive also includes some policies to help the financial market mobilise funds for investment.\n\nBanks should provide businesses credit for development of production and trading.\n\nEconomist Le Xuan Nghia said however that it would be difficult for banks to further cut interest rates since huge quantities of government bonds are being issued.\n\nIn fact, if the Government issues bonds at this rate, the interest rates would rise again if inflation exceeds 5 per cent, he warned. --\n\nHyosung Vietnam to expand business\n\nFibre producer Hyosung Vietnam Limited Company will spend another US$ 600 million to expand its business in the southern province of Dong Nai.\n\nThe company's CEO Sun Hyung Yoo told Dong Nai newspaper on Wednesday that in preparation for the expansion, the firm has signed a lease agreement with the Viet Nam Urban and Industrial Zone Development Investment Corporation (IDICO) to rent another 22.6ha in the Nhon Trach 5 industrial zone, increasing the total area of the company's operations to 90.6ha in the province.\n\nHyosung Vietnam is a subsidiary of the Korean firm Hyosung Corp.\n\nIt produces fibres of all kinds, and has been operating in Dong Nai for more than seven years, with a total registered investment of $995 million, according to the province's People's Committee.\n\nThe company says that 90 per cent of its products are exported. In 2014, the firm earned more than $1 billion in revenue, and became an important stronghold of the Hyosung Corporation in the South Korea.", "Samsung Smart TV may \"listen\" in on viewers. (Photo Courtesy of iStock)\n\nPALO ALTO, CA - Between the lawsuits filed this week in the hack of the nation's second largest health insurer, Anthem, Inc., and the White House Cyber Summit at Stanford today, cybersecurity dominated the conversation this week in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe public, however, also is facing concerns about privacy invasions from a source they might never suspect: their own televisions.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. came under fire this week after it was reported that the company's new Smart TVs could \"listen\" to viewers' private conversations.\n\nThe Smart TVs feature a voice recognition system that allows users to give verbal commands to the television, which customers and analysts worry could potentially be used to record private conversations and even share the information with a third party.\n\nThe system, designed for improved \"ease of use\" is activated either by issuing specific commands such as \"change the channel\" or \"increase volume\" into a microphone on the remote control, or by clicking the activation button. Users, however, still worry that the system could pick up sounds other than those intended for the television.\n\nPublic outrage on social media caused Samsung to address the worries directly on the company's blog.\n\nSamsung's policy cautions customers to \"please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\"\n\nA February 10 post on the company's blog entitled \"Samsung Smart TVs Do Not Monitor Living Room Conversations,\" stated that the voice recognition program could only pick up certain predetermined commands such as \"increase the volume\" or \"change the command.\"\n\nSamsung further attempted to reassure customers that all data was encrypted. The company updated its privacy policy to state that Samsung will only collect interactive voice commands when users make a \"specific search request,\" which may be transmitted to the third-party service provider Nuance Communications, Inc. The company assured customers that their information would only be used to evaluate and improve Voice Recognition features.\n\nThe company's efforts, however, failed to silence critics.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins, for example, tweeted a side-by-side photo comparing Samsung's privacy policy to George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. His remarks have been retweeted more than 20,000 times in fewer than five days.\n\nParker Higgin's tweet has been favorited 9,000 times and retweeted more than 20,000 times since February 8. (Alex Hicks/Peninsula Press)\n\nThe controversy even pushed U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) to question the company's policies. In a letter February 11 letter to North America Chief Executive Officer Gregory, Franken wrote: \"I am concerned that Samsung currently does not provide consumers with the information needed to understand how their voice data may be used by third parties.\"\n\nSen. Franken sent a similar letter on February 10 to LG Corp.'s U.S. President William Cho. LG is one of a number of companies whose smart televisions also feature voice recognition technology. Franken claimed that the company's privacy policy was unclear as to whether they shared data with a third party. The policy urges users to \"\"be aware that if your spoken word includes personal or other sensitive information, such information will be among the Voice Information captured through your use of voice recognition features.\"\n\nLG did not respond to a request for comment. But Samsung representatives say there is no cause for concern.\n\n\"Samsung does not retain voice data or sell it to third parties,\" a Samsung spokesman told ABC News. \"If a consumer consents and uses the voice recognition feature, voice data is provided to a third party during a requested voice command search. At that time, the voice data is sent to a server, which searches for the requested content then returns the desired content to the TV.\"\n\nSome technology analysts back up Samsung's claims. For instance Forbes technology contributor John Archer said in a February 12 article:\n\n\"It's hugely important to stress...that Samsung TVs don't even start listening to you at all unless you fire their listening abilities up by using a keyword or, on some models, pressing a mic button on the control. So they're not constantly sat [sic] there listening to every word you say.\"\n\nStill, in a climate of cybersecurity alert, companies like Samsung will likely have to work to regain customers' trust.\n\n\"I feel a bit annoyed that...it wasn't made clear to me in advance of buying the TV,\" said Smart TV owner Peter Kent in an interview with the BBC. \"It makes me think twice.\"\n\nSpeakers at today's White House Cyber Summit held at Stanford University say they are equally committed to ensuring users' privacy.\n\n\"If we don't do everything we can to protect privacy, we risk more than money,\" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. \"We risk our way of life.\"", "Forget UV sensors and heart rate monitors on your gadgets, what about something that can do much, much, more? Researchers at Columbia University recently created a device that could cost as low as $34 but can accurately test for syphilis and HIV, providing results to the user within just 15 minutes. Something so simple and private could help save lives.\n\nThe attachment, 10 years in the making, is large and far from svelte, but it can easily pop into an iPhone's headphone jack and analyze a blood sample quickly. A user will have to prick his or her self first, and then insert that blood test into the device, The Washington Post said.\n\nThen, the iPhone's processor and special software can determine whether or not a user is infected with syphilis or HIV. \"The new device essentially replicates the HIV test considered a gold standard for laboratory testing, as well as the same kind of syphilis tests you might get in a standard laboratory,\" The Washington Post explained. The device made its debut in a new paper published in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe health gadget was created by Columbia Univeristy associate professor of biomedical engineering Samuel Sia and his team, and Sia hopes that it might one day be available for consumers to purchase, especially since the whole set-up costs around $34 to build (plus a small fee, under $2, for the tabs to insert into the device for analysis).\n\n\"If you can start to bring core health services to the smartphone beyond just measuring the heart rate -- like blood tests -- then you're going to start seeing a pretty fundamental shift in the health care system,\" he said. There's currently no time frame for a public launch, but considering Apple, Google, Samsung and other smartphone makers are all competing to build out new health hubs on their devices, it seems plausible we'll see this sooner than later.", "The Samsung's hype train is officially rolling. In anticipation of their March 1st event in Barcelona, Samsung has begun teasing what will be a major focal point of their upcoming flagship's camera: its low light shooting capabilities.\n\nUsing the hashtag #TheNextGalaxy, Samsung uploaded a video to Twitter which doesn't show much, just a very dimly lit corridor and the taglines \"Great vision,\" \"A unique view,\" and finally, \"I am #TheNextGalaxy.\" If the dark hallway in the video is any indication, the upcoming Galaxy S6 will likely make low light shooting a priority (something the Galaxy S5 struggled with).\n\nIf you needed any further clues Samsung was talking about low light shooting, a few hours later they uploaded a photo to their Twitter account -- which has changed its name to TheNextGalaxy -- with the tag \"Find clarity in darkness.\" Remember, the Galaxy S6's camera is rumored to feature OIS, something that should drastically improve low light shooting (the longer the camera's shutter is open, the more small movements can blur the image).\n\nSmartphone cameras have always struggled when it comes to shooting in anything less than adequate lighting, something HTC tried to address with the \"UltraPixel\" camera in their One line. Because smartphone camera sensors are so tiny, OEMs are faced to think up new ways at tackling this solution. OIS is just one of them. We'll keep you updated with more as it unfolds.", "When new smartphones are announced these days, the camera quality and specs are usually front and center. If you're wondering why manufacturers focus so much on mobile photography, check out the chart above: taking photos is the most used feature of smartphones alongside text messaging.\n\nThe chart was shared recently in a slideshow created by Samsung marketing. It's based on data from a Pew Research Center survey done of smartphone users in 2011.\n\nThe study found that 92% of smartphone users use their phones to take pictures. 80% of users go on to send their photos elsewhere after they're snapped.\n\nSmartphone photography is more popular than Internet browsing, emailing, app downloading, and gaming.\n\nHere's a second interesting chart created by Samsung:\n\nAccording to a Comtech study done in 2014, the quality of a smartphone's camera is the third most important consideration for phone buyers, trailing only 4G/LTE capability and reliability/durability.\n\nConsumers as a whole are very serious about using their smartphones as an everyday pocket camera.", "Earlier this week, we learned that Samsung televisions are eavesdropping on their owners. If you have one of their Internet-connected smart TVs, you can turn on a voice command feature that saves you the trouble of finding the remote, pushing buttons and scrolling through menus. But making that feature work requires the television to listen to everything you say. And what you say isn't just processed by the television; it may be forwarded over the Internet for remote processing. It's literally Orwellian.\n\nThis discovery surprised people, but it shouldn't have. The things around us are increasingly computerized, and increasingly connected to the Internet. And most of them are listening.\n\nOur smartphones and computers, of course, listen to us when we're making audio and video calls. But the microphones are always there, and there are ways a hacker, government, or clever company can turn those microphones on without our knowledge. Sometimes we turn them on ourselves. If we have an iPhone, the voice-processing system Siri listens to us, but only when we push the iPhone's button. Like Samsung, iPhones with the \"Hey Siri\" feature enabled listen all the time. So do Android devices with the \"OK Google\" feature enabled, and so does an Amazon voice-activated system called Echo. Facebook has the ability to turn your smartphone's microphone on when you're using the app.\n\nEven if you don't speak, our computers are paying attention. Gmail \"listens\" to everything you write, and shows you advertising based on it. It might feel as if you're never alone. Facebook does the same with everything you write on that platform, and even listens to the things you type but don't post. Skype doesn't listen -- we think -- but as Der Spiegel notes, data from the service \"has been accessible to the NSA's snoops\" since 2011.\n\nSo the NSA certainly listens. It listens directly, and it listens to all these companies listening to you. So do other countries like Russia and China, which we really don't want listening so closely to their citizens.\n\nIt's not just the devices that listen; most of this data is transmitted over the Internet. Samsung sends it to what was referred to as a \"third party\" in its policy statement. It later revealed that third party to be a company you've never heard of -- Nuance -- that turns the voice into text for it. Samsung promises that the data is erased immediately. Most of the other companies that are listening promise no such thing and, in fact, save your data for a long time. Governments, of course, save it, too.\n\nThis data is a treasure trove for criminals, as we are learning again and again as tens and hundreds of millions of customer records are repeatedly stolen. Last week, it was reported that hackers had accessed the personal records of some 80 million Anthem Health customers and others. Last year, it was Home Depot, JP Morgan, Sony and many others. Do we think Nuance's security is better than any of these companies? I sure don't.\n\nAt some level, we're consenting to all this listening. A single sentence in Samsung's 1,500-word privacy policy, the one most of us don't read, stated: \"Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\" Other services could easily come with a similar warning: Be aware that your e-mail provider knows what you're saying to your colleagues and friends and be aware that your cell phone knows where you sleep and whom you're sleeping with -- assuming that you both have smartphones, that is.\n\nThe Internet of Things is full of listeners. Newer cars contain computers that record speed, steering wheel position, pedal pressure, even tire pressure --- and insurance companies want to listen. And, of course, your cell phone records your precise location at all times you have it on -- and possibly even when you turn it off. If you have a smart thermostat, it records your house's temperature, humidity, ambient light and any nearby movement. Any fitness tracker you're wearing records your movements and some vital signs; so do many computerized medical devices. Add security cameras and recorders, drones and other surveillance airplanes, and we're being watched, tracked, measured and listened to almost all the time.\n\nIt's the age of ubiquitous surveillance, fueled by both Internet companies and governments. And because it's largely happening in the background, we're not really aware of it.\n\nThis has to change. We need to regulate the listening: both what is being collected and how it's being used. But that won't happen until we know the full extent of surveillance: who's listening and what they're doing with it. Samsung buried its listening details in its privacy policy -- they have since amended it to be clearer -- and we're only having this discussion because a Daily Beast reporter stumbled upon it. We need more explicit conversation about the value of being able to speak freely in our living rooms without our televisions listening, or having e-mail conversations without Google or the government listening. Privacy is a prerequisite for free expression, and losing that would be an enormous blow to our society.", "In just four years, Chinese tech company Xiaomi has become the third biggest smart phone maker in the world.\n\nMention the company's name stateside, though, and you'll likely get a blank look in return. Xiaomi's phones are well-known across Asia, but the company hasn't made any moves to enter American or European markets - until now.\n\nXiaomi is starting (very) small. Over the next few months it will begin selling accessories such as headphones and smart wristbands in the US, according to a Reuters report.\n\nXiaomi president Lin Bin and vice president Hugo Barra, formerly the head of Android at Google, gave a presentation to reporters in San Francisco on Thursday, but didn't mention whether the company has plans to sell its Mi smart phones and tablets in American stores. Xiaomi will take its first step outside of Asia later this year when it begins selling Mi devices in Brazil, South America's largest economy.\n\nXiaomi almost certainly wants to test the waters in the US before deciding whether to sell its devices there. Mobile companies such as AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint have more control over the US phone market than Asian telecom companies have over their markets. The system of carrier subsidies could make it difficult for Xiaomi to sell smart phones as cheaply as it would like. (In China, the company's flagship Mi Note phone retails for $370, which is about half the cost of a comparable iPhone 6 Plus off contract.)\n\nThe elephant in the room here is Apple. Xiaomi has drawn criticism for allegedly lifting design elements from Apple products, including the construction of the iPad Mini and the iPhone. Even the Android-based MiUI operating system found on Xiaomi's products looks a lot like iOS. Apple has an immense amount of influence over the US phone market. If Xiaomi were to introduce its devices in the US, it would be directly competing with Apple, and would perhaps open itself up to more direct criticism that elements of its company and its products are borrowed from Cupertino.\n\nThat said, Xiaomi has been sending a clear message since last year: our products stand on their own merits. The company's latest designs are more unique. Founder Lei Jun has eased back on the Steve Jobs jeans-and-black-shirt look for presentations. And Xiaomi has focused on engaging directly with customers through the Mi Forum, a company-sponsored network with 40 million users. \"We're friends with our fans,\" Mr. Lin told reporters on Thursday.\n\nIf Xiaomi decides to sell its devices in the US, it'll be going toe-to-toe with Apple for the first time. But by expanding its geographic scope slowly, Xiaomi is giving customers a chance to become familiar with its brand first. And if the company does decide to come stateside (and figures out a way to continue selling Mi phones and tablets at a fraction of what customers are used to) it could be a powerful competitor to Apple and Samsung.", "The NBA is getting into the virtual-reality game -- although only a small number of hoops fans will be able to get in on the action, for now.\n\nThe league said Friday it will shoot the 64th NBA All-Star Game, as well as the weekend's three-point and slam-dunk contests, in 360-degree video. The footage is to be available via Samsung Electronics' Milk VR experience shortly.\n\nIn addition, during the 16th annual NBA All-Star Technology Summit in New York, the league is featuring a virtual-reality showroom with highlights captured by VR technology startup NextVR from a Miami Heat-Cleveland Cavaliers game in October 2014 shot in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n\"With basketball enthusiasts all over the world, it's paramount that we explore new ways to bring fans even closer to the game,\" said Jeff Marsilio, NBA VP of global media distribution. \"We're very excited about the possibilities and look forward to rolling out the content to our fans.\"\n\nOnly a limited number of people will be able to watch the VR video.

Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has rocketed to the top of the Chinese market by inviting customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, a former Google executive and now a top official at Xiaomi.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access.\n\nThe phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280.\n\n\"It may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" says Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nThe formula is working so well that Xiaomi often draws comparisons to Apple, whose 2007 release of the iPhone triggered a cultural revolution. While the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders.\n\nXiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung Electronics at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS.\n\nBut another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, Bin added, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China.\n\nBesides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also sells a stuffed bunny that serves as Xiaomi's mascot. About 2 million of the bunnies have been bought so far, according to Xiaomi.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company faces big hurdles to entering the US market, where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiamo has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies.\n\nExecutives took pains to stress an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed on its own, to run on top of the Android operating system that Google makes available for other device- makers to use.\n\nWhen asked if such accusations could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the US, for fear of patent lawsuits, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The lofty appraisal came less than five years after Xiaomi's inception.\n\nThe company's eight founders include: CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin Lin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\nBarra defected from his previous job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion into markets outside China.", "Earlier this month, RadioShack filed for bankruptcy after 94 years in business, and announced it would sell possibly half of its stores while closing the rest of its 4,000 stores in the U.S. Saying goodbye to this iconic brand isn't easy, especially for those of us trying to keep our companies fresh and attractive. However, there's a silver lining: we can learn from RadioShack's mistakes.\n\nThe company, once known as the world's largest electronics chain, set out years ago to make a name for itself as the go-to brick-and-mortar for electronic gadgets. In its prime, it was a household name, the one-stop shop for technology needs. But at one point, it just stopped evolving, and became a punchline.\n\nRadioShack remained stuck in the '80s and '90s as cooler, cheaper options like Best Buy and Amazon took center stage. The store failed to keep up with fast and furious technological advances, and didn't adapt to consumers' ever-changing needs.\n\nLack of Innovation\n\nWhen Amazon was founded in 1994, the competitive landscape changed forever. It was the dawn of the Internet age, and the website slowly became a worldwide giant as it innovated.\n\nFirst, the site began expanding its inventory to not only sell books, but also everything from electronics, to DVDs, to clothing, to even groceries. Then it jumped into the e-book reader market with the Kindle, which led to the Kindle Fire a few years later, a fine opponent to the iPad.\n\nMeanwhile, Best Buy was taking the necessary steps to remain a valuable option in the face of a competitor like Amazon. After struggling for a few years trying to get its groove back, the retailer changed its business model, implemented a matching prices policy and introduced the concept of stores within stores, partnering with leading brands like Samsung and Apple.\n\nBut as others changed, RadioShack's showroom remained the same grey, outdated display of technology. The stores didn't even have enough variety in their inventory to fall prey to \"showrooming,\" where customers visit a store to evaluate a product but opt to purchase at a cheaper online retailer, usually Amazon.\n\nFalse Starts\n\nRadioShack may not have been innovative, but they fought against the current to stay afloat. The company tried to update its business model, moving towards mobile tech. In fact, by 2013, 52 percent of the company's sales were from mobile devices.\n\nThey also tried to rebrand and refresh the old image. Last year, one of the most memorable Super Bowl commercials was RadioShack's own, \"The '80s Called: They Want Their Store Back.\" The hilarious spot recruited some of the most memorable '80s stars and signaled a turn for the better in the company. Even the stock market responded well to it, with stocks rising 7 percent the next morning.\n\nBut in its efforts to compete, RadioShack lost sight of who they were. Technology changed rapidly, but their gadgets did not, and many of them were rendered obsolete as smartphones came into the picture with apps that easily replaced them. They didn't focus on the right things, and that led to fruitless attempts to become relevant once again.\n\nThe Right Focus\n\nWhat should have the company focused on? For starters, their staff. When employees are clear about who they are and their objectives, it can serve as a fantastic opportunity to further your company's goals and have ambassadors for your brand. But instead, the Internet is filled today with more than its fair share of RadioShack horror stories, which tell about low morale and overworked retail employees who are clueless about company culture.\n\nThere was a huge missed opportunity to innovate in other areas, as well. While RadioShack might have not been your first choice when shopping for a new laptop, for example, it could have been the perfect place to learn how to use that laptop, whether it was via an app, in-store classes, or online tutorials. Company leadership knew the ship was sinking, but had no idea how to help the stores evolve. Their energy was spent trying to compete, when RadioShack could have created a new concept instead.\n\nThe inability to evolve led RadioShack to extinction. Other companies have an opportunity to learn from its mistakes. In the end, what matters is that consumers find your products or services useful and relevant. If they move on, and you are unable to, your fate is sealed.", "The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S6 is definitely a handset we're looking forward to, not just for its new design and new Exynos chipset, but for its camera as well. There has been some talk about the Galaxy S6's camera and how it will be an \"intelligent\" camera, and sure enough Samsung has begun to tease us about it.\n\nSamsung Mobile has recently posted a teaser video on its Twitter page with the caption that reads, \"I am #TheNextGalaxy. Be inspired by my vision at #Unpacked.\" We're not sure what that means, but it is obvious from the image and the wording that Samsung is indeed teasing us about the handset's camera.\n\nJust in case you missed our earlier coverage, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is rumored to feature a 20MP rear-facing camera and a 5MP front-facing camera, both sensors of which are said to have been made by Samsung themselves.

Now, wireless connections on everyday home products are creating new safety concerns for homeowners. The I-Team's investigation reveals digital back doors that could be leaving your family vulnerable to attack.\n\nChicago-based security researcher Matt Jakubowski took us on a tour of internet-connected home devices with big security vulnerabilities. For our demonstration, he's hacked these popular smart devices from inside his own home.\n\n\"This is a thermostat that is hackable,\" Jakubowski said.\n\nThe attack begins on this thermostat. With a few keystrokes he installs his own logo on the equipment, but a real attacker wouldn't leave a trace.\n\n\"Now we're going to be able to gain access to this and so an attacker would maybe take it back to the store without changing that logo and return it, make it look like it's never been opened. The store will just put it right back on the shelf ready for the next person to buy, then they're going to install it in their home and not even know that they had a back door installed,\" Jakubowski said.\n\nExperts say inserting a backdoor on a device that you then buy for your home is just one way hackers could get inside your network. Weak security on home wireless networks is another targeted entry point.\n\n\"It's the network you need to protect, and that access in,\" said Jeremy Hajek, a professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nHajek cracked a common home router with brute force by using a hacking program to try every possible password combination until it spit out the network key - and he was in.\n\n\"Once you can get the network key, basically you can then, it's as if you were in the person's house, you were another device, because you're on their network,\" Hajek said.\n\nBack at the hacked house, the attack continues.\n\n\"Get in through the thermostat, get access to that network, find this device sitting there and then control the lights,\" Jakubowski said.\n\nAfter taking control of these smart lightbulbs from a smart device hub, we head outside and hack this WiFi security camera.\n\n\"We're able to view the camera and if this were located somewhere else in the house, we could see if anyone was in the house. For this we have it in the garage, and we know that no one is in the house, so if we wanted to, we could start opening the garage right now. Just with a click, it connects to the device and the door opens,\" Jakubowski said.\n\nThe WiFi garage door opener is now compromised.\n\nABC7's Chuck Goudie: \"From this point, you're essentially into the house.\"\n\nJakubowski: \"Now we're inside the house.\"\n\nGoudie: \"Could you turn off a security system through this as well?\"\n\nJakubowski: \"Yeah, we could turn off the camera now, make sure that they don't get any alerts that something happened, go in, do whatever we wanted to do, walk out, turn everything back on, and it's like nothing even happened.\"\n\nGoudie: \"Would there be a record of this on their security devices?\"\n\nJakubowski: \"Not the way I'm doing it.\"\n\nOur expert says the garage door opener was the most secure device on the network, and even so, it was vulnerable to attack.\n\nJust like the security camera we hacked in the garage, unsecured webcams are easily compromised and the videos are often linked online. The I-Team uncovered glimpses you might not expect, from inside a home to businesses - even catching a yoga class on a tennis court.\n\n\"The camera we used was just for the garage, but it could be installed anywhere. It could be installed in your child's room, watching your child at night, maybe your baby and see it was sleeping, it could potentially open up a world for attackers to view,\" Jakubowski said.\n\nManufacturers of the smart devices hacked by our expert say security is top priority for their companies and recommend always keeping the software of smart products up to date while using strong network passwords. The manufacturer of the hacked smart lights controller says their software has been updated to prevent this type of hack. The thermostat's manufacturer said our expert's access required contact with the device -- and to their knowledge, no device has ever been hacked remotely. The smart garage door manufacturer says they are actively investigating the vulnerability our expert uncovered.\n\nFULL COMPANY STATEMENTS\n\nNest Thermostat: \"All hardware devices - from laptops to smartphones - are susceptible to jailbreaking, this is not a unique problem.

It was dubbed the \"Superman phone\" by the likes of CNET and deemed one of the \"most disruptive innovations\" at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show by a Forbes contributor.\n\n\"Isn't that cool? Out of Utah we're competing against Apple and Motorola and HTC and Samsung head to head with a better phone than they've ever built,\" Sayers said. \"I'm pumped, if you can't tell.\"\n\nThe variety of exclusive features it offers is what sets the V\u02db apart from other smartphones, according to Sayers. Its new gaming and movie beaming technology, which allows users to wirelessly transmit HD video to nearby screens, is one of the phone's most praised assets.\n\nThe smartphone is made out of Kevlar and has optical image stabilization on its rear 21-megapixel and front 13-megapixel cameras, a special antenna that boosts reception by up to a full bar and protection that makes it waterproof for 30 minutes under 3 feet of water, among other features. Sayers said there are a total of 17 exclusive features on the phone.", "Okay sure, here you go, but hang on: don't we have one of those new Samsung smart TVs?

And we doubt it's got anything to do with washing the storefront windows.\n\nA second blackout period is also given between April 19th and April 27th. It's possible this could be the launch of the curved Galaxy S Edge smartphone, although Phone Arena's source predicts it will in fact be a new Note tablet, and that the Galaxy S Edge will launch alongside the S6. We'll just have to wait and see.\n\nPhone Arena also believes that it's likely that Korean gadgeteers will be first to be able to buy the phone(s), with the U.S and other markets possibly getting it a few weeks after.

Our two main gripes however, have been build quality and software bloat.\n\nThe former looks well on its way to being fixed, with the Galaxy Note 4, A3, A5 and A7 all featuring metal, not to mention numerous leaks consistently supporting an all-metal premium Galaxy S6. And now it looks like the software bloat is also on its way to being mended.\n\nSamsung tends to cram everything it can into its TouchWiz Android software, and while many functions like Multi Window are genuinely useful, there's a lot there that can happily be stripped out without being missed. Often, it can tend to run a little slow, even on speedy hardware.\n\nAccording to Sam Mobile however, the Galaxy S6 will land without the pre-installed Samsung apps we're used to seeing. Whether this includes the likes of staples like S Voice and S Health remains to be seen, but it's certainly welcome news for Android purists.\n\nThe S6 will also reportedly arrive with Microsoft apps including OneNote and Office, with speedy performance to boot. TouchWiz on the Galaxy S6 is said to be \"amazingly fast when compared to Android Lollipop on the Galaxy Note 4\", which sounds very promising.\n\nWe should be wrapping our hands around the Galaxy S6 on Sunday 1 March at its launch in Barcelona, so stay tuned for the full lowdown.", "After having released a free version of OneNote 2013 last year for personal use last year, Microsoft is now adding more features at no charge. With the change, five features previously reserved for the paid version are now available to users of the free edition of OneNote. These features make your digital notes richer with added content options and more secure.\n\nFor added security, users can now password protect select sections of their notebooks. Password protection allows users to protect private or sensitive information in their notebooks.\n\nThe page history feature allows you track changes and go back to prior versions of a page.\n\nThose who want to add more depth to their notes can now embed files directly into the notebook. If you're referencing a specific Word document or Excel spreadsheet, you can insert Office files into OneNote.\n\nAdditionally, the free version now allows you to take audio and video clips while you're inking or typing in OneNote.\n\nTo better manage your files, OneNote allows you to search for words in video or audio recording. If you're recording an hour-long board meeting or class lecture and want to jump to keywords, this feature could be a welcome time saver.\n\nDigital inking\n\nAs digital pens are gaining momentum in the tablet space, OneNote's expanding free feature set could make it a more attractive option when compared to competing note-taking services like Evernote and Samsung's S Note application on the Galaxy Note series. While Evernote's strength rests in its simple UI and its focus on saving web clippings, OneNote feels like a more organized notebook.\n\nAlthough OneNote is available on a number of different platforms, including Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS, the experience is most complete on Windows with access to more features. Making these features free could help Microsoft drive up enterprise demand for Windows tablets against competition from Apple's iPad and the Android-powered Galaxy Note.\n\nMicrosoft may also be making a bigger bet on the pen. Most recently, the company is rumored to be in talks to acquire N-Trig, the company that makes the technology behind the Surface Pen for Microsoft's $799 (\u00a3519 or AU$1029) Surface Pro 3 tablet.

He needs to do things and say things that no other president would ever have to do, simply because a majority of his voters consume news online. Last week, Obama did a bunch of interviews with online publications, one of them was with BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith (which you can read the transcript here.)\n\nAlong with the interview, BuzzFeed did a little teaser video showing Obama doing some funny sketches, even cursing his own name in frustration (\"Thanks, Obama\"). And yes, he brandishes a selfie stick. After this video aired, opponents (read: Fox News) were quick to denounce the segment as dumb, \"Tone Deaf\" and a waste of time.\n\nBut I've always seen Obama's appearance on BuzzFeed or talk shows, whether late night or online, as particularly genius. Yes, he's hawking his own platforms and legislation, but at least he's smart enough to realise how people consume news now. It's about going viral, making fun of Zach Galifinakis, and yes, sometimes using a selfie stick.\n\nAnd if people have a problem they're just going to have to get used to it, because I can almost guarantee you whoever wins in 2016 is destined to do an entire interview for the Oculus Rift or something.

It comes down to market share and what consumers will buy into.\"\n\n[Related: Partners: Apple Watch's Release Will Boost Smartwatch Market]\n\nAccording to market research firm IDC, the five-year-old company has faced staggering growth levels with its 16.6 million shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014, growing 178.6 percent from the previous year's fourth quarter of 5.9 million global shipments.\n\nXiaomi emerged as a Chinese smartphone vendor, with devices like the Redmi 1s 4G and Mi4, known for its low price-point devices and popular flash sales. The company has ventured beyond China to probe other markets this past year, recently releasing its Redmi Note 4G in India.\n\nVarious partners had mixed ideas about which smartphone vendors would feel the most pressure if Xiaomi released its Mi mobile devices in the U.S. market in the future.\n\nJordan stated that the Chinese company had the same consumer strategies as Apple, and would put increased pressure on the Cupertino, Calif.-based vendor's market share.\n\n\"Xiaomi phones are very consumer-focused, and does what Apple does at a cheaper price,\" he said. \"This means Apple will have to be more aggressive. Apple's done a good job, but many people in America are looking for the best bang for the buck. And, in that case, having more inexpensive products might be more important.\"\n\nBut other partners think the future potential move could eat into the consumer base for Samsung's less expensive smartphones.\n\n\"It seems like a really interesting entry into the U.S. market,\" said Michael Oh, founder of Tech Superpowers, a Boston-based Apple reseller. \"I think, by and large, if Xiaomi succeeds in the U.S., it will hurt Samsung and Android, more so than Apple ... unless Xiaomi is able to provide some radically different value propositions, I doubt that they'll do anything more than Android has.\"\n\nAnalyst Jack Narcotta, devices analyst at Hampton, N.H.-based market research firm Technology Business Research, said that Xiaomi's entrance into the American market is \"a low-risk move into a big market.\"\n\n\"It's a smart move that will help Xiaomi test the U.S. market,\" he said. \"Their biggest obstacle right now is that they have no brand awareness, so this is a good opportunity for them to test out consumer consideration. They have a steep hill to climb, and Xiaomi needs to ask how they will bring more value to the market.\"\n\nAccording to IDC, Xiaomi was the fifth-place global smartphone vendor in the fourth quarter of 2014, taking 4.42 percent of market share. The company emerged on the radar screen due to its rapid growth and solid demand in China, and its steady release of new devices, like the Mi4 LTE.\n\nDespite Xiaomi's rapidly flourishing success in China, Narcotta warned that the company faces a plethora of challenges as it makes headway in the U.S. market.\n\n\"Because Xiaomi has no brand awareness at this point, they're facing a very strong and entrenched incumbent competition in the U.S. market,\" he said. \"They're not just competing with brands in mobile, but also with companies selling wearables and batteries. That's going to be a wrinkle for them at this time.\"\n\nXiaomi's president Lin Bin said that the company will launch the wearables and headset devices in coming months. According to Reuters, the company said it will also further expand into countries like Brazil.", "NEW YORK -- Just as I was warming up to choosing a Microsoft Office 365 subscription over making a one-time software purchase, Microsoft started giving away a lot of subscription benefits for free. The company now offers Word, Excel and others at no cost on most mobile devices.\n\nIt's a smart move by Microsoft, but it makes me wonder whether you really need a subscription, which starts at $70 a year.\n\nThe subscription will appeal to people who use Office apps on traditional Windows or Mac computers or Windows tablets, such as the Surface Pro 3. Those who primarily use iOS and Android mobile devices can probably stick with free apps. What's right for you comes down to whether you need a PC or can get things done with just your smartphone or tablet. Here's what to consider.\n\nMicrosoft's newly released Office apps for iPhones, iPads and Android tablets are quite good. Microsoft offers Word for text documents, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, Outlook for email and OneNote for organization -- all for free. (Access for databases and Publisher for desktop publishing aren't available yet.)\n\nI'm writing this review on Word using an iPad and Android tablets from Samsung and Google -- the latter with a wireless keyboard. I've edited documents on an iPhone and am pleased it has the same features that are available on the iPad, though with some menu changes to account for the smaller screen.\n\nI'm still not totally used to the mobile apps, especially for cutting and pasting text in Word and inserting cells in Excel spreadsheets. There are also missing features, such as green underlines of potential grammatical mistakes. But the apps include most of what I use on PCs. You do have to sign in with a Microsoft account, but you can create one for free.\n\nOn Apple devices, a subscription would unlock about two dozen features, such as inserting section breaks and tracking changes between drafts. (Some power users might need these, but I don't.) There are fewer features available for Android phones and tablets, whether free or for pay. Microsoft says the Android apps will catch up, as well as the version for Windows phones.\n\nNote: If you have a Windows tablet, you must pay for Office unless you're running a lightweight operating system called RT.\n\nCan't live with just a smartphone or tablet? You can buy Office for personal computers and Windows tablets the traditional way, by paying for the software just once. For $140, you get Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Comparatively, an Office 365 subscription costs $70 a year for one user, so by year three the subscription is costing you more. You're guaranteed the latest version of Office, which comes out every three years, but the one-time fee is still cheaper.\n\n-- For iOS and Android mobile devices, you get extra features you can't get any other way.\n\n-- Most Windows tablets, including the Surface Pro, require a one-time purchase or subscription, even for basic features. The subscription also gives you three apps you don't get with the $140 one-time purchase: Outlook, Access and Publisher. (You can buy all seven Office apps for a one-time fee of $400, but the subscription is cheaper.)\n\n-- For PCs, a $70 one-user annual subscription lets you use all seven Office apps on multiple PCs and tablets by signing in and out. The $140 one-time purchase limits you to one device and four of the seven apps.\n\n-- The subscription is a great deal for multiple users or multiple PCs. For $100 a year, rather than $70, you can install the software suite on up to five Mac or Windows PCs, so you don't have to keep signing in and out. That can be five PCs you have, or five individuals in a household. You can switch up the PCs as often as you like. (A subscription also allots you an additional five tablets and five phones, but Microsoft doesn't really enforce that limit.)\n\n-- If you have a lot of files to store, a subscription gives you 1 terabyte of online storage through OneDrive, compared with just the 15 gigabytes you get with a free account. You also get 60 minutes a month of Skype calls to anyone. Typically, free Skype calls are limited to other Skype users.\n\nThe days of keeping your digital life on a single machine are long gone, and the subscription makes it easy to manage multiple PCs. But people tend to have multiple mobile devices, not PCs. Microsoft's giveaway of iOS and Android apps eliminates a major need for a subscription.\n\nThen again, Microsoft has little choice when it's competing with cheap and free apps that recognize the Office file format. The company would rather people stick with Office, even for free, in hopes they will buy premium features later. There are signs that's working: Excluding business customers, Office subscribers grew 30 percent to 9.2 million in the last three months of 2014 -- the same period Microsoft released its latest iPhone and iPad apps and made core features free.", "Traditionally, the best word to describe Google's Android operating system has been \"utilitarian.\" The engineers behind the world's leading mobile platform have long emphasized features over aesthetics.\n\nBut that may be starting to change. In its latest version, dubbed Lollipop, which has just started to roll out to older phones and tablets, the look and feel of Android and its primary apps get a major overhaul.\n\nGoogle calls the new look in Android 5.0 \"Material Design.\" It's marked by brighter colors, a \"flatter\" but layered look to applications and icons, and greater emphasis on clear and legible text.\n\nThe new design borrows ideas from the flat look that Apple introduced to its mobile operating system in iOS 7 and the interface Microsoft designed for its Windows Phone software. Android remains distinct from both, but it now appears to be in the same family.\n\nFor example, when you turn on Lollipop's new \"battery saver\" mode, the notification bar at the top of the screen and the taskbar at bottom turn a bright orange. The look is reminiscent of how the notification bar turns green in iOS when you are on a call or blue when you turn on its personal hotspot feature.\n\nSimilarly, many of the Google-designed apps in Lollipop have a unique color in their menu bars that serves to distinguish them from other apps. While Gmail's accent color is red, the one for the contacts app is blue.\n\nThe net result is an operating system that feels less like something designed by engineers for engineers and more like something that is lively, fun and accessible to non-techies.\n\nGoogle made some other design changes in Lollipop. One is to how Android displays open applications when you want to switch between them. In previous versions, when you pressed the \"overview\" button to see which applications you had running, Android would display a vertical list of thumbnail images of those programs. With Lollipop, Android displays them like a carousel, with the app windows stacked one on top of another. I prefer the new look, because it allows you to see more of the open apps at once.\n\nGoogle has also revamped the quick settings feature in Android. It's still available in the notifications area, but it's now accessible by swiping down twice from the top of the screen. It also includes some new settings, such as the ability to turn on a smartphone's hotspot feature or to turn on a device's flash to use it as a flashlight.\n\nTo be sure, Google did more in Lollipop than revamp Android's look. The updated software also includes lots of new features.\n\nAmong them are a greater amount of options and controls for notifications. Android users can now respond to alerts that display on their lock screen. They can turn on a privacy feature that allows notifications to be displayed on the lock screen, but blocks their content, such as the actual message in a text message. And they can turn on a mode that will only display alerts from particular people and apps.\n\nOne of the cool new features of Android is that it gives users more options in how to share their devices with others.\n\nAndroid tablets have been able to support multiple user accounts for a while now. With Lollipop, Android smartphones gain the same ability, allowing consumers to access their own contacts and other data on a friend or family member's phone. Lollipop also adds allows users to create guest accounts on both smartphones and tablets that can access any apps but none of the personal data on them.\n\nOf note for parents, the new software has a related feature that allows users to \"pin\" a particular app to the screen so that a child, say, can't use any other apps or see anything else on the device. That might be helpful if your kid wants to play a game on your phone, but you don't want them to see your email or reconfigure your homescreen.\n\nThese types of features -- support for multiple users and the ability to easily restrict access to younger users -- are ones that I've long wished Apple would build into iOS.\n\nGoogle has also enhanced the security in Android. In Lollipop, encryption is turned on by default; previously, it was hard to know that you could use it to protect your data, because to turn it on, you had to find it deep within the system's settings. While Android's ability for apps to work together fairly seamlessly was a selling point over iOS until recently, it's also been a vulnerability, potentially allowing malware to gain access to important functions on the device.\n\nIn Lollipop, Google limits the access particular programs have to the underlying functions; your apps should still be able to work together, but they should pose a lot less of a threat to functioning of your phone.\n\nAs with any new version of Android, the big questions for users are when they will be able to get the new software and the degree to which phone manufacturers will customize it. Although Lollipop has started to become available to certain Android devices, there are lots that still can't get it. When I tried several days ago to download it to two Android smartphones I've been testing -- Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge and Sharp's Aquos Crystal -- it wasn't available.\n\nMeanwhile, few electronics manufacturers offer an unadulterated Android experience. Unless you have one of Google's Nexus devices, you may not see many of the cool new interface features in Lollipop.\n\nOverall, Lollipop is a sweet new update. With both good looks and cool features, it's well worth downloading if you can get it.", "Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Ice Cream Sandwich and Kit-Kat are all of Android's operating systems. Although it's been a while since the Lollipop was unveiled, a lot of handsets are still yet to have it. We're starting to see it trickle down to more handsets, but it's down to the individual manufacturers to bring it to their own devices. In fact only 1.6% of Android devices are running on Android 5.0. An apple a day might keep the doctor away, but there's no denying we all need a little sugar in our lives every once in awhile.\n\nUnwrapping Lollipop\n\nGoogle states, \"Lollipop is designed to be flexible, to work on all your devices and to be customized for you the way you see fit.\" In other words, the operating system's responsive design will remain consistent across all screens (smartphones, tablets, TVs and even Android Wear) while offering Android users advanced settings that lets them decide when they want their device to display notifications and allow incoming calls. Best of all, Lollipop has a built-in battery saver feature that can extend the life of a device up to 90 minutes, boasts the Android website.\n\nSweet Features, Sweeter Security\n\nThese upgrades to Android's operating system are fine and dandy, but what do they really mean for us as mobile users? Two words: tighter security. Like the iPhone 6, Androids will now be encrypted, which is great news for those worried about their privacy. Encryption stores your phone's data in an unreadable format, which makes it harder to hack. According to The Guardian, the FBI isn't thrilled about the idea of encrypted devices because it makes criminal investigations more difficult. But, they were the ones that led us to believe encrypted data would protect us from hackers in the first place.\n\nIn addition to greater protection from hackers, you also can share your device with a guest user mode or multiple user accounts. If you've ever wanted to share your device with someone without them having access to your stuff (and who hasn't?), Android's got you covered. Android Smart Lock is yet another layer of security that pairs your phone or tablet with a trusted device like your wearable tech or your car. You can unlock your device via Bluetooth simply by getting near your vehicle, states Tom's Hardware, an online tech publication.\n\nHow to Get Your Sugar Fix\n\nLollipop is free and is starting to become readily available on handsets this week. However, keep in mind that some devices might take longer to receive the newest Android OS.\n\nNexus devices will be the first to receive the update, with the Nexus 6 coming with the update pre-installed. The Nexus 5 will receive the update shortly, but it hasn't launched just yet. Luckily for Samsung S5 users, you can update your phone to Android 5.0 right now. Samsung is starting to roll out the update for the Galaxy Note 4 as well. As for other models, HTC One M8 & LG G3 are ready to be updated, with other models catching up in the very near future.\n\nOnce you receive the notification to install Lollipop, it's a good idea to first back up your data including your contacts and photos. If you don't get an automatic notification asking you to upgrade your device, begin the update manually by going to Settings > About Phone > Software Update and select \"Software update check.\" You'll soon be on your way to a better, more powerful Android.", "Samsung is set to ring in the changes with its Galaxy S6 handset and abandon its much criticised practise of filling the handset with unwanted 'bloatware,' it has been claimed.\n\nSamsung's next generation Galaxy handset is set to come in two versions - one with a curved screen that covers both its sides, and be revealed on March 1st.\n\nNow it is claimed the software will also see a radical change.\n\n'There are some really interesting things Samsung is doing if our info is correct, and perhaps the biggest change the S6 will bring is the removal of all pre-installed Samsung apps, or at least that's how our insider put it.'\n\nThe Korean firm has been heavily criticised in the past for only offering half the storage its customers pay for and although this has been improved with the S5, it is still a problem.\n\nMailOnline revealed that on a 16GB Samsung S5, users get approximately 10GB of space for their own personal files, photos and apps.\n\nHowever, the Galaxy S6 will come with apps like Microsoft OneNote, OneDrive, Office Mobile (with a free Office 365 subscription), and Skype, according to Sammobile.\n\nBoth new S6 phones will have all-metal bodies and 5.1inch screens, it has been claimed.\n\n'Samsung Electronics Co. plans to release two new versions of its top-tier Galaxy smartphone next month, including a model with a display covering three sides, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter,' Bloomberg said.\n\nThe 'special edition' version will have the curved technology, according to Sammobile.\n\nThe Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple.\n\nThe handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March.\n\n'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed developing a Galaxy S6 with two-edge displays, one on each side, reports our source,' said the Sammobile site.\n\nThe curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge.\n\nHowever, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode\n\n'You will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them,' explained Sammobile.\n\n'So, calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area.'\n\nSamsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device.\n\nThe screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it.\n\nThe Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts.\n\nThe curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example.\n\nBecause the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages.\n\nPrevious leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F -- the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6 -- will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera.\n\nEarlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year.\n\nInstead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better.\n\nThe South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply.\n\nThe strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi.\n\nHe said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third.\n\nLast month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit.\n\nThe smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year.\n\nCompared to a record-high of \u00a36 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved \u00a32.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September.\n\nThese figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model.\n\nThe South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models.\n\nBut the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business.\n\nIn response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers.\n\nExecutives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart.\n\n'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts.\n\nIn a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions.\n\nThe company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.\n\nThe earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of \u00a33 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider.\n\nThe decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED.\n\n'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said.\n\nThe company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'.\n\nIn emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals.\n\n'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said.\n\nThe company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.", "The marquee events of NBA All-Star Weekend are going virtual.\n\nThe three-point contest and slam dunk event and its practice session at Barclays Center on Saturday night, as well as the 64th NBA All-Star Game on Sunday from Madison Square Garden will be shot in the virtual reality format, with highlights depicting immersive, 360-degree views soon to be available through Samsung's Milk VR.\n\nFans with the Samsung Gear VR Innovator Edition headset powered by Oculus, and a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will be able to access the marque hoops content for free by downloading the Milk VR app and navigating to the NBA section for streams or downloads.\n\nIn January, the league announced it would become the first U.S. professional sports league to bring virtual reality experiences to the public. The NBA, which announced last month that it would become the first U.S. pro sports league to present virtual experiences to the public, plans to deliver new experiences on Samsung's Milk VR, introduced at last month's Consumer Electronic Show, throughout the balance of the 2014-15 campaign.\n\nIn addition to sports, the service offers downloads in the highest quality available (4K x 2K) and adaptive streaming options across music, action and lifestyle, with new content appearing daily.\n\nThe NBA and its technology teammates gave attendees of the league's All-Star Technology Summit a chance to sample a courtside, virtual reality presentation of an October preseason game between the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers in Rio de Janiero, as part of its Global Games initiative. Last month, that series of contests yielded the first-ever U.S. pro league contest in 4K. Neulion streamed the presentation of BT Sports ultra-high production of the Milwaukee Bucks-New York Knicks contest from London's O2 arena at NBA headquarters in Manhattan.\n\nAs to Samsung's Milk VR, the service offers downloads in the highest quality available (4K x 2K) and adaptive streaming options across sports, music, action and lifestyle, with new content appearing daily.\n\n\"With basketball enthusiasts all over the world, it's paramount that we explore new ways to bring fans even closer to the game,\" said Jeff Marsilio, NBA vice president of global media distribution. \"Virtual reality delivers amazing vantage points like the NBA All-Star Game from a courtside seat or Sprite Slam Dunk from the baseline. We're very excited about the possibilities and look forward to rolling out the content to our fans.\"", "There was a time when Oculus Rift was the only virtual reality headset that mattered. Then Sony weighed in with Project Morpheus, and for a while there was a bit of a rivalry going on.\n\nLately it seems everyone is trying their hand at virtual reality, though, from Google and LG to toy maker Mattel - and, most recently, Panasonic.\n\nThe Japanese company this week showed off its own VR headset, which is more similar to the Rift and Morpheus than Google Cardboard or Gear VR - it sports its own OLED display instead of interfacing with a smartphone.\n\nHowever in form it looks more similar to Gear VR than the Rift, with a front-heavy design that hooks onto users' ears like a pair of glasses.\n\nSee you in 2020\n\nThe screen outputs at up to 75 frames per second with 90-degree viewing angles, but for now it's just a prototype and that will likely improve.\n\nPanasonic showed off the headset alongside an omnidirectional camera, similar to Samsung's Project Beyond, that it reportedly hopes to utilize during the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nHopefully we learn more about it before then, though.\n\nThe PS4 keeps getting better with age\n\nVia Slashgear/image via Nikkei", "NEW YORK -- Just as I was warming up to choosing a Microsoft Office 365 subscription over making a one-time software purchase, Microsoft started giving away a lot of subscription benefits for free. The company now offers Word, Excel and others at no cost on most mobile devices.\n\nIt's a smart move by Microsoft, but it makes me wonder whether you really need a subscription, which starts at $70 a year.\n\nThe subscription will appeal to people who use Office apps on traditional Windows or Mac computers or Windows tablets, such as the Surface Pro 3. Those who primarily use iOS and Android mobile devices can probably stick with free apps. What's right for you comes down to whether you need a PC or can get things done with just your smartphone or tablet. Here's what to consider.\n\nMicrosoft's newly released Office apps for iPhones, iPads and Android tablets are quite good. Microsoft offers Word for text documents, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, Outlook for email and OneNote for organization -- all for free. (Access for databases and Publisher for desktop publishing aren't available yet.)\n\nI'm writing this review on Word using an iPad and Android tablets from Samsung and Google -- the latter with a wireless keyboard. I've edited documents on an iPhone and am pleased it has the same features that are available on the iPad, though with some menu changes to account for the smaller screen.\n\nI'm still not totally used to the mobile apps, especially for cutting and pasting text in Word and inserting cells in Excel spreadsheets. There are also missing features, such as green underlines of potential grammatical mistakes. But the apps include most of what I use on PCs. You do have to sign in with a Microsoft account, but you can create one for free.\n\nOn Apple devices, a subscription would unlock about two dozen features, such as inserting section breaks and tracking changes between drafts. (Some power users might need these, but I don't.) There are fewer features available for Android phones and tablets, whether free or for pay. Microsoft says the Android apps will catch up, as well as the version for Windows phones.\n\nNote: If you have a Windows tablet, you must pay for Office unless you're running a lightweight operating system called RT.\n\nCan't live with just a smartphone or tablet? You can buy Office for personal computers and Windows tablets the traditional way, by paying for the software just once. For $140, you get Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Comparatively, an Office 365 subscription costs $70 a year for one user, so by year three the subscription is costing you more. You're guaranteed the latest version of Office, which comes out every three years, but the one-time fee is still cheaper.\n\n-- For iOS and Android mobile devices, you get extra features you can't get any other way.\n\n-- Most Windows tablets, including the Surface Pro, require a one-time purchase or subscription, even for basic features. The subscription also gives you three apps you don't get with the $140 one-time purchase: Outlook, Access and Publisher. (You can buy all seven Office apps for a one-time fee of $400, but the subscription is cheaper.)\n\n-- For PCs, a $70 one-user annual subscription lets you use all seven Office apps on multiple PCs and tablets by signing in and out. The $140 one-time purchase limits you to one device and four of the seven apps.\n\n-- The subscription is a great deal for multiple users or multiple PCs. For $100 a year, rather than $70, you can install the software suite on up to five Mac or Windows PCs, so you don't have to keep signing in and out. That can be five PCs you have, or five individuals in a household. You can switch up the PCs as often as you like. (A subscription also allots you an additional five tablets and five phones, but Microsoft doesn't really enforce that limit.)\n\n-- If you have a lot of files to store, a subscription gives you 1 terabyte of online storage through OneDrive, compared with just the 15 gigabytes you get with a free account. You also get 60 minutes a month of Skype calls to anyone. Typically, free Skype calls are limited to other Skype users.\n\nThe days of keeping your digital life on a single machine are long gone, and the subscription makes it easy to manage multiple PCs. But people tend to have multiple mobile devices, not PCs. Microsoft's giveaway of iOS and Android apps eliminates a major need for a subscription.\n\nThen again, Microsoft has little choice when it's competing with cheap and free apps that recognize the Office file format. The company would rather people stick with Office, even for free, in hopes they will buy premium features later. There are signs that's working: Excluding business customers, Office subscribers grew 30 percent to 9.2 million in the last three months of 2014 -- the same period Microsoft released its latest iPhone and iPad apps and made core features free.", "Illustration file picture. (REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Files)\n\nDoes playing Pandora through your dashboard put you at risk of being driven off the highway by malicious hackers? It might, according to work by computer researchers and a survey published this week by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.\n\nThe survey comes during the same week President Obama sits down with Silicon Valley tech titans to discuss cyber security, an issue that gains in prominence as more devices become connected the Internet. One of the greatest cyber threats may be to automobiles as cars morph into rolling computers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMuch of the technology - scores of processors in most vehicles - is aimed at making cars safer, but this growing technical complexity also affords hackers an opportunity to digitally break into vehicles and wrest control of the vehicle from drivers. As Sen. Markey's office discovered, auto makers are not anxious to discuss issues of cyber security and privacy - several companies decided not to respond to the Tracking & Hacking questionnaire - but the issues are real.\n\nBack in 2011, a Nissan Leaf owner discovered that the car's onboard Carwings system could be used to pull down personal information remotely using an RSS feed without the driver's knowledge. Speed, location, and direction could be tracked. While the loophole was quickly plugged by Nissan, it was an unsettling discovery.\n\nDrivers are understandably sensitive to the issue of privacy and security. That same year, when GM tried to change the terms of how it uses information collected from OnStar, the safety and communications system, users became irate with the idea that their private information might be sold to other companies. It was such a contentious issue that the Supreme Court later cited it in a decision regarding expectations of privacy in the car.\n\nSince then, the technology in cars has advanced rapidly, including semi-autonomous features that automatically steer and brake a vehicle. The 2015 Corvette even has an optional system for recording video from the car. And voice recognition systems commonly send the driver's spoken instructions to servers on the Web to process, a practice that caused mild hysteria when Samsung admitted earlier this month that its TVs did the same thing.\n\nResearchers have repeatedly demonstrated how cars could be used to eavesdrop on drivers and passengers, as well as how to take over braking and steering. Two researchers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, have shown how to perform such hacks, and last summer they examined car computer systems and ranked models for security. Only one Audi model seemed to have been designed with security in mind.\n\nThe problem stems from what scientists call the attack surface, the various possible points of entry available to a hacker. Now the attack surface has broadened because of a multitude of electronic safety systems (like adaptive cruise control) and common wireless technologies - cellular data, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, for example - that enable remote access from anywhere in the world.\n\nDARPA, the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, recently demonstrated such a remote attack for the show \"60 Minutes.\" Scientists took control of a car from the reporter behind the wheel, jamming on the brakes and later driving it through a row of pylons.\n\n\"It's more like the kinds of vulnerabilities we've come to expect in our desktop software,\" John Launchbury, a program manager at DARPA told FoxNews.com. \"They get patched regularly as bugs are identified.\" But, he added, that's not the ideal approach for securing automotive systems.\n\n\"No one wants to have to regularly patch their cars,\" Lance Cottrell, chief scientist at cybersecurity firm Ntrepid, told FoxNews.com.\n\nAnd no one wants to wait until there's an accident or fatality to find a flaw.\n\nSome of the security problems can be quickly addressed. Not allowing automatic Bluetooth pairing would be a first step, albeit at a slight sacrifice in convenience. Researchers also say that automakers need to use standard encryption and security protocols. More difficult is the idea of preventing data from being sent to a car through its cellular connection since that's how navigation and other information is conveyed; it's also how some future software fixes could be transmitted.\n\nMore troubling is the way these systems are pieced together. The company that makes an electronic control unit for the braking system may not have access to the computer code for the rear view video camera or cellular data connection, for example. It's the integration of these multiple layers where vulnerabilities are found.\n\nFortunately, there's been no reported instance of a criminal duplicating the DARPA stunt. So the world of cyber hijacked cars taking us on wild rides or creating accidents is not yet upon us. Texting while driving and failing to wear a seat belt are more immediate threats. But it's also obvious that as automakers advance upon the future of autonomous cars they are going to have to take security and privacy concerns much more seriously.\n\nJohn R.

This time, however, he did an about face, but was not shy sharing his views (that Beyonce should have won the award) in media interviews backstage. As it turns out, Beck should thank him. Why? From all the media exposure of Kanye's rant, Beck's album sales shot up 1342 percent.\n\nBeck wins the trifecta\n\nLuckily for Beck, his album sales benefitted from the promotional trifecta - (1) winning a major award, (2) getting more media attention and exposure, and (3) receiving sympathy from an unwarranted and unfair attack from the \"Attila the Hun\" of the music business. Of course, Beck got a brand assist from Taylor Swift as a result of her parallel experience five years ago.\n\nApple gets an assist from Samsung\n\nWhile seemingly unrelated, Apple is getting a similar assist from Samsung, which announced the release of its Galaxy S6 smartphone on March 1st. By all accounts, Samsung has borrowed a lot more than the number \"6\" from Apple. As with Apple, it is making its new smartphone from aluminum and glass; it is launching Samsung Pay, which reportedly functions in a similar way to Apple Pay; and it is copying Apple's use of an authentication chip to prevent 3rd-parties from making unauthorized options.\n\nWhat disparaging and copying does for competitors\n\nWhat Samsung and Kanye don't seem to understand is that when you copy or disparage rivals, it typically helps them succeed. There are many reasons why this is the case.\n\nCopying\n\nCopying is the highest form of flattery, and when you copy the most valuable company in the world, the flattery only helps its bottom line. Apple has roughly 86% of the smartphone profits, and Apple is eating into the market share of its competitors. Pepsi followed Coca Cola, and has been trying to overtake the original for many years. The result? Pepsi slid from 2nd to 3rd place several years ago.\n\nDisparaging competitors\n\nEven before Kanye's rant, Samsung repeatedly disparaged Apple in its ads. What has this done for Apple? Its share of smartphone profits was pegged at 73% three years ago, and as described above, it is up to 86%. What about Beck? Sales of Beck's album shot up over 13-fold.\n\nWhy disparaging competitors rarely works for you and helps them\n\nWhat can businesses learn from these mistakes?\n\nDisparaging or copying competitors is not a good strategy because it will help them and hurt you. If you want to win, you have to find out what your target audience needs that it is not getting and satisfy those needs better than your competitors. While it is easy to say and harder to do, you have to do it if you want to come out on top. Best of luck.", "Samsung found itself in a bit of a rough patch in 2014, even with the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, but hopefully not because of the launch of the Galaxy S5, and as a result 2015 has been a big year to look forward to. Samsung is expected to announce some pretty impressive devices this year, starting with the Galaxy S6, which the manufacturer has already teased on its own for boasting an \"amazing camera.\"\n\nThe Galaxy S6 is coming, and for someone out there, quite a few people probably, it's going to be exactly what they've been waiting for. Maybe even since they bought a Galaxy S5 last year. The Galaxy S6 is going to be the perfect match for someone, and more than likely, no matter what it looks like or what it features, someone's going to buy it just because it's new.\n\nThere might even be someone out there that buys it just because it's a Samsung smartphone.\n\nSamsung has had to face a lot of yelling and hand-waving regarding the design of its devices and software over the years, and while it's been able to shake some of that off, even leading up to the Galaxy S6 announcement there are a lot of reports out there talking about how the unannounced device \"already\" looks like an iPhone 6. It's not even official yet, but we've already got a lot more people than we should saying Samsung's newest smartphone is going to look like Apple's newest smartphone.\n\nThat's why I'm really hoping that Samsung basically just throws in all of the edged displays it can at its newest smartphones. Word has it that Samsung is going to launch the \"traditional\" Galaxy S6 alongside the Galaxy S6 Edge, which could feature up to three edged displays! And while one edge wasn't all that exciting for the Galaxy Note Edge in 2014, this is something that Samsung is obviously very keen on, and so they're going to keep releasing phones that feature it. Eventually, the market will jump on board, probably, and then edged displays will be all the rage for whatever reason.\n\nI don't even really care about the functionality, or whatever functionality that a manufacturer thinks I'll get out of an edged screen. I just want it to look so different, so left field, that you know for a fact that that's what you're looking at out in the wild. When someone that owns the Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge goes outside, shows off their phone, people recognize and it say, \"That has to be a Samsung.\" Or even say the name of the phone. But that might be too crazy.\n\nI don't want Samsung to emulate any other manufacturer anymore. I want them to come out this year and show off their new smartphones that just look futuristic, or ridiculous, or both, and I want them to do what they always do: throw a bunch of technology into them so the spec hounds can freak out and throw their money at their computer screens.\n\nI'm actually really excited to see what the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge look like. Here's to hoping Samsung doesn't disappoint.", "A still from Wild -- The Experience, a short virtual-reality film.\n\nImagine sitting back in a chair, sliding a headset over your eyes and headphones over your ears. Suddenly, you're sitting on a rock in a sun-dappled clearing, surrounded by tall trees, alone with the noises of the forest. Alone, that is, until you turn your head and spot Reese Witherspoon walking toward you, looking like a haggard camper with a giant pack on her back.\n\nThis is what it's like to watch the opening bit of Wild -- The Experience, a short virtual-reality film made as a promotion for the Witherspoon-led movie Wild, which is based on Cheryl Strayed's book about her trek along the Pacific Crest Trail. Despite the clunky feeling of a headset on your face, for a few moments you feel transported to someone else's reality. You sense the calming stillness of nature and see it all around you -- a contrast with the weirdness of watching Witherspoon stopping to rest on your left without acknowledging your presence.\n\nThis is just one immersive experience that F\u00e9lix Lajeunesse and Paul Rapha\u00ebl are creating at Felix & Paul Studios, their Montreal-based film production company that focuses on live-action 3-D and virtual-reality films. Their studio and a few others are exploring ways to take virtual reality beyond video games. \"We like to think of virtual reality not as a medium to actually create horror stories and heavy adrenaline-driven emotions, but rather to use it as a way to enhance the human experience,\" Lajeunesse says.\n\nThe world of virtual-reality films is still small -- it's not much more than a collection of experiments, and to check any of them out you'll need a headset of some sort. But the continued development of headsets such as Oculus Rift, the Samsung-Oculus Gear VR, and Sony's Project Morpheus signal that immersive display technologies may finally be about to go mainstream.\n\nAnd as demand for virtual-reality devices heats up, Lajeunesse and Rapha\u00ebl believe a desire for new forms of cinematic experiences will come along with it. \"We believe it's going to grow into a new, totally distinct art form,\" Lajeunesse says. Hollywood seems intrigued: Wild-The Experience was commissioned by Fox Searchlight Pictures, which released Wild. Fox Searchlight did not respond to requests for comment, but Mike Dunn, president of 20th Century Fox's home entertainment business, has said he expects to start selling virtual-reality clips related to Fox movies this year.\n\nMaking VR movies is much different from making a regular movie -- for one thing, it's much harder to control where the viewer is focusing attention. And there are still many challenges to overcome in figuring out how to enable users to really explore a live-action virtual world the way you can an animated one or a virtual-reality game. Still, the early results hint at how entrancing the results can be, suggesting how virtual reality might be used for things like education and work collaboration as well as entertainment.\n\nLajeunesse and Rapha\u00ebl have backgrounds in traditional filmmaking, and so far they've focused their virtual-reality work exclusively on short, live-action pieces. Their first film, Strangers, with Montreal singer-songwriter Patrick Watson, seats you on an ottoman inside Watson's studio so you can hang out while he plays music. It debuted at SXSW in Austin, Texas, in 2014. Since then, the duo has made several more, including Herders, which brings you into the world of Mongolia's nomadic yak herders, and a scene from the Cirque du Soleil show Zarkana.\n\nTo make films that look and sound real, Lajeunesse and Rapha\u00ebl built a 360\u00b0, stereoscopic 3-D camera system and an audio system that can record sound from all around. They had to build their own postproduction software, too, and essentially edit while wearing a Gear VR headset, Lajeunesse says. In editing, they add in a virtual spot where the viewer is meant to be sitting while taking in the virtual world.\n\nThe Wild film is the first that Felix & Paul made as a reactive experience. That is, your behavior while watching the film (such as where you look) determines whether or not a second character appears: Strayed's mother (played by Laura Dern), who in this scene would be a figment of Strayed's imagination.\n\n\"We like that notion of reactivity because it also enhances the sense of presence,\" Lajeunesse says. Even the basics of VR filmmaking have been challenging. Early on, the most difficult task Felix & Paul faced was figuring out how to film scenes so that scale of the virtual world didn't seem off to some viewers. And the studio's films thus far haven't incorporated any computer-generated effects to give the viewer a body, so you feel a bit like a ghost while watching -- if you lift your real-world arm in front of your face, you won't see anything.\n\nThere's also the problem of standing up or even leaning over. While it's possible to make virtual-reality games and films with computer-generated 3-D models that keep track of a user's changing position and adjust to that shifting perspective, thus far this isn't the case with live-action films made for VR. Right now, for instance, you can turn around while watching a Felix & Paul piece, since it's filmed in 360 degrees, but if you get out of your chair while watching one, the whole universe will rise with you.\n\nDespite the issues, Jeremy Bailenson, an associate professor at Stanford and the founding director of the school's Virtual Human Interaction Lab, thinks virtual reality is an exciting medium for short live-action films. With such pieces, he says, \"you get to leverage what I call the paradox of virtual reality: the brain treats it as real, yet anything is possible.\"", "\u25b2 Walmart\n\nTarget? Buh-bye\n\nThe world's biggest retailer is wasting little time taking advantage of the spectacular failure of Target Canada. Walmart announced it will invest $340 million to expand in Canada, boasting that its plans will result in the creation of 5,000 jobs. Walmart will be completing another 29 supercentre stores, on top of the 11 that already opened in January. Most of the proposed projects are actually conversions of existing stores into the oppressively large supercentre format, complete with grocery departments.\"Our mission is to provide multiple access points for customers to save money,\" said company president and CEO Dirk Van den Berghe, in a rather benign assessment of Walmart's mission to squeeze suppliers and discourage unionization at all costs. Walmart's store count will total 396 when the expansion is completed next January. Though the company hasn't publicly expressed interest in any of the stores left behind by Target, analysts expect Walmart will pick up a few. With Target gone, Sears Canada struggling, and a mid-market apparel chain going belly up every week, Walmart's expansion plans virtually assure that Canada's desolate retail landscape will soon be dominated by blue-vested Walmart greeters proffering smiles and deals on toilet paper.

The complaints came from users in Australia, who reported that every 15 to 30 minutes an ad for Pepsi would take over their screens. \"It's as if there is a popup ad on the TV,\" wrote one user. There are worse harms that smart technology could inflict on humans, but intrusive ads are [Subscribe to Canadian Business now and get a bonus gift!] still pretty annoying. To its credit, Samsung responded quickly to fix the problem, and said the rogue Pepsi ad was due to a \"recent software update that was not intended for the Australian market.\" The snafu couldn't have come at a worse time for Samsung.

Simpson earned a bachelor's degree in marketing from Northeastern University.", "Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke before President Barack Obama at a cybersecurity summit at Stanford University on Friday, and he was able to slip a few major Apple Pay announcements into his talk reiterating his commitment to privacy.\n\nThere were two big Apple Pay developments from today's talk: First, Apple Pay will be \"available for many transactions with the federal government.\" Cook specifically cited paying for admission at national parks, but it's not hard to imagine Apple Pay support expanded to the gift shop at the Smithsonian, for instance, or for foreigners paying fees for visa applications. The federal government will begin to accept Apple Pay starting in September, but whether you will be able to use your iPhone to pay Uncle Sam on September 1st probably depends on how the government procures NFC-enabled point-of-sale systems, so it could take a while.\n\nThe second announcement is a much bigger deal: In a press release, the White House announced that it was was working with big financial networks to enable Apple Pay for federal payment cards -- specifically those for Social Security payments and veteran's benefits.\n\nSocial Security payments used to come through the mail, in the form of a check. But in 2013, a new policy went into effect requiring those receiving benefits to receive payments electronically. That leaves two choices: Signing up for direct deposit, or receiving a pre-paid debit card called DirectExpress that's automatically refilled, which is the option for those without a bank account. If Apple Pay were to work with DirectExpress debit cards, it would mean that pensioners could pay for their morning coffee at McDonalds with their iPhones.\n\nThe fact sheet also says the federal government would like to get Apple Pay working with GSA SmartPay cards, but unless you're a government employee expensing travel, you're unlikely to have one of those.\n\nAccording to the Social Security Administration, there are currently over 55 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits worth over $71 billion in aggregate per month. Clearly, it's a big market. And although not every dollar coming in to beneficiaries through Social Security will be spent through Apple Pay, even a small chunk of that is massive.\n\nCook and Obama's announcement reflects that Apple is willing to further integrate itself into our daily lives, even if it has to work with slow-moving institutions like the federal government to do it. At the end of his talk, Cook mentioned that he could see even official documentation, like passports, being accessible through smartphones:\n\n\"We can imagine a day in the not-so-distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past, your passport, your driver's license, and other important documents can be digitally stored in a way that's safe, secure, and easy to access,\" Cook said.\n\nOne big advantage the iPhone platform has over Android for government applications is that Apple controls and implements trusted execution environments in its own chips, which it calls its Secure Enclave and Secure Element. The Secure Enclave helps keep the user's fingerprint and other critical information separate from the main operating system, helping prevent it from being hacked or spoofed, is a big reason why Apple Pay has a higher degree of tokenization than Google Wallet. On Android devices, the secure element is implemented by chip companies like Qualcomm or ARM, as well as manufacturers like Samsung, meaning that Google simply has less control over applications -- like payments -- where security is the top priority.\n\nBy tacitly endorsing Apple Pay at a cybersecurity conference, the White House has given Apple its security seal of approval. Considering governments won't accept digital documents without first ensuring the software that powers them is secure, that's a big deal.\n\nImagine a hacker stealing your passport and spoofing it on his own device. That wouldn't just be annoying, that could be dangerous on a national security level. As we increasingly carry important credentials on our devices -- the state of Iowa is going to start issuing smartphone driver's licenses this year -- security becomes paramount. If Apple has the inside track on getting government approval for its smartphone security, as our wallets become part of our devices, then government applications could come to iPhone first, and Android second.", "The Samsung Galaxy S6 will soon offer a new option for smartphone shoppers that many users should wait for and all signs point to a metal design that many HTC One fans love on the HTC One M7, M8 and the rumored HTC One M9. Our Samsung Galaxy S6 vs HTC One M8 comparison will help set expectations for users who are thinking of upgrading from the HTC One M8 to the Galaxy S6 or who are trying to decide which of these they should buy.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 rumors are arriving faster than ever as we pull within two weeks of the Galaxy S6 announcement and the HTC One M8 is almost a year old, which means we know a lot about this device.\n\nWhile we don't know everything about the Samsung Galaxy S6 we have a very good idea of what to expect and thanks to the latest leaks we have a great Galaxy S6 concept that shows what it could look like.\n\nRead: Galaxy S6 Concept Brings Rumors to Life\n\nThe Galaxy S5 and HTC One M8 competed for the last year and on the same day that Samsung plans to announce the Galaxy S6 we expect to see HTC show off the HTC One M9. Many buyers will be looking at those two devices, but for users who are upgrading or comparing deals with the latest smartphones this is a look at what we know so far.\n\nAlthough some rumors pointed to a 5.5-inch Galaxy S6 it now looks like the device will be closer in size to the HTC One M8 that includes a 5-inch display. The HTC One M8 stood out in the Android market with a metal design, but it looks like the Galaxy S6 will deliver that major upgrade this year.\n\nWe can't know everything about the Galaxy S6, but thanks to several key leaks we have a good idea what Samsung will announce. Here is how the Galaxy S6 vs HTC One M8 comparison stacks up.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 announcement is on March 1st in Barcelona, Spain. This is at the start of Mobile World Congress 2015. There will be a live stream of the event for users to watch from home.\n\nWe expect a fast Galaxy S6 release after the event and recent reports delivered two potential ranges for a Galaxy S6 release date.\n\nCurrently rumors point to vacation blackouts from March 22-30 and April 19-27 for Samsung Mobile employees. And the same dates are blacked out for Samsung retail employees in a memo that tells workers, \"Exciting things are just around the corner!\"\n\nThere is a very good chance that the U.S. Galaxy S6 release date will take place during one of these time periods and that we will see Galaxy S6 pre-orders before the release.\n\nThe HTC One M8 release arrived in early 2014, right after the announcement.\n\nThe HTC One M8 refined the metal design from the first HTC One to deliver a phone that felt better in the hand and it came with HTC Advantage that covered one cracked screen replacement within six months at no additional cost.\n\nRead: HTC One M8 Review\n\nLeaks show a Samsung Galaxy S6 design that uses a metal frame and possibly a glass back like you can see in our Galaxy S6 renders. The video below shows off what the Galaxy S6 design might look like.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 dimensions in our concept are 143.30 x 70.81 x 6.91 mm, which are in line with rumors. The exact measurements may change. This is similar to the HTC One M8 dimensions of 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4 mm, but a little shorter overall.\n\nWe expect to see a new home button that delivers a fingerprint reader that users can press a finger on to unlock the phone, similar to how Touch ID works. The HTC One M8 does not include a fingerprint reader.\n\nHTC includes a Micro SD card on the One M8 and we expect to see Samsung continue to offer this. There is no user-replaceable battery on the HTC One M8 and we could see Samsung follow this trend as part of the upgraded design.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 display will likely deliver an upgraded 2K resolution with a 5.1-inch screen. The HTC One M8 offers a 5-inch 1080P display. This means the Galaxy S6 will deliver a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution with 575 pixels per inch compared to a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution with 441 pixels per inch on the HTC One M8. The Galaxy S6 display rumors come from multiple leaks including some on Samsung's own website.\n\nSamsung already demonstrated that they can make a great looking, power friendly 2K display with the Galaxy Note 4, so it isn't that much of a shock to see this upgrade. If the Galaxy S6 display is anything like the one in the Note 4, which received a lot of praise, you can expect an amazing way to use the phone.\n\nA 1080P display like on the HTC One M8 isn't bad, it's a pretty common resolution still, but the higher resolution screens can show more detail in photos and videos.\n\nAll signs also point to two Galaxy S6 models, including one with a curved edge that could be the Galaxy S6 Edge. Expect a higher price, and possible a slower release for this model. Read our Galaxy Note Edge impressions for a look at what the curved screen can do on a Samsung phone.\n\nYou can't judge a phone on specs alone, but when you look at the rumored Galaxy S6 specs next to ehe year-old HTC One m8 specs there are some clear upgrades.\n\nThe HTC One M8 lacks a fingerprint sensor and the camera did not live up to the hype. The front-facing speakers on the HTC One M8 deliver loud clear sound, that the competition has a hard time matching.\n\nWe expect a 16-20MP camera on the Samsung Galaxy S6 with Optical image stabilization. This should deliver better photos in low light. On the front, expect a 5MP sensor with support for a wide-angle selfie feature. Expect similar options to the Galaxy Note 4 camera app, shown below.\n\nThe HTC One M8 features two rear-facing cameras that use larger pixels and great photo editing software that let you blur the background, create a video of your recent photos and videos and perform other tasks, but the photos aren't as sharp as we would like.\n\nThe HTC One M8 runs Android 5.0.1 on several carriers and an update is on the way for many others. The Samsung Galaxy S6 will arrive with Android 5.0 Lollipop, possibly Android 5.0.1 or Android 5.0.2.\n\nThe video below shows the HTC Sense 6 software on the HTC One M8 including BlinkFeed and other HTC tweaks that change the look of Android slightly and adds features.\n\nWe don't know what the Galaxy S6 software will look like, but the rumors indicate Samsung will tone down the TouchWiz changes and the added apps that normally come with a Samsung device. We saw this trend from the Galaxy S5 to the Galaxy Note 4 and expect greater slimming of bloat for the Galaxy S6.\n\nYou can buy the HTC One M8 on all major U.S. carriers including Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T and US Cellular. The HTC One M8 is also available on pre-paid networks like Net10, GoPhone, and other smaller regional carriers. On a two year contract at a carrier store you can expect to pay $99 to $199 when you sign a new two-year contract. You can also buy the HTC One M8 on Amazon for $99 on most carriers. There are also $0 down options if you want to pay for the price of the phone ove the course of a year or longer without a service contract.\n\nYou can expect the U.S. Galaxy S6 carriers to include as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon and U.S. Cellular. DOn't count on pre-paid options right away or regional carriers. We are waiting for pricing information, but you can count on $199 to $249 on contract and an off contract price from $650 to $680. This would equal out to a $25 to $30 a month payment with many of the $0 down options.", "Most phone manufacturers like Samsung, HTC, and LG launch one flagship phone per year, whereas Sony prefers to update its smartphones biannually. But now, new rumors suggest the Xperia Z4 will be the only flagship phone to appear from Sony this year. Furthermore, passing Japanese certification authorities hints at an upcoming release date, plus rumors of more than one version of the Z4 emerge.\n\nAccording to a source that contacted Phone Arena, the Xperia Z4 will have slimmer top and bottom bezels, as well as more rounded corners. The phone is said to be a 5.5-inch phablet and have a mirrored front and rear, and will reportedly be available in white, black, and yellow.\n\nThere has been much speculation about the Z4's screen size. Early rumors hinted that the screen would be 5.5 inches, while another rumor suggested that the screen will be slightly smaller at 5.4 inches. However, the latest rumors claim that Sony will be sticking with the 5.2 inch screen. There is speculation that the screen will get a boost from 1080p resolution to 1440 x 2560.\n\nThe phone is expected to have a 2.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 octa core processor and 4GB of RAM. Storage will be set at 32GB, which can be expanded with a micro SD card.\n\nAs seen with the Xperia Z3, rumors suggest that the Z4 could come with another version specially designed for music enthusiasts. The device is dubbed as the Sony Xperia Z4 Music, following Sony Japan's leak of a render which shows the phone.\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z4 is expected to launch at the Mobile World Congress 2015, which will run from March 2 to 5. The phone is also rumored to have a product placement in the upcoming James Bond movie, \"Spectre,\" and that James Bond actor Daniel Craig and director Sam Mendes will have some input on the design.", "Samsung Galaxy Note 4 users have something to smile about these days. The much-awaited Android 5.0.1 Lollipop update on the phablet has started, reported first in Poland on Feb. 11, 2015, and then in South Korea on February 12, 2015, according to reports on Android Central and SamMobile.\n\nThe Android Central report noted that the update in Poland was made available to users over the air or OTA, and was not yet accessible via Samsung Kies. Users can check if the update is available by going to the software update page on Settings>About Phone. The SamMobile report on the hand described that South Korean users accessed the update via Kies and was initially being promoted by mobile carrier, SK Telecom. It also expects other mobile carriers to follow suit soon.\n\nThe SamMobile report also noted that the update is only available for the Galaxy Note 4 variant that carries the Samsung Exynos chip, and is not yet available for the Snapdragon variant. This seems to support Samsung's recent move to prioritize its home-grown chip, especially in their new smartphone and phablet models, after it decided to drop Snapdragon for its new flagship phones.\n\nThe update, according to Android Central, brings \"a brand new look and feel to the user experience,\" with a more \"improved performance\" and \"stronger battery life.\" A more detailed description in another report by Android Authority says the update also features \"new lock-screen notifications and heads-up notifications.\" Most reports also featured screen shots of the update.\n\nThe actual roll-out of updates followed two weeks after the online release of the Android Lollipop user manual for three variants of the Note 4 on the Samsung website last January 28, 2015.\n\nNo definite date has been set for when the update will be available to other users, such as those in North America.", "When it comes to smartphones, sometimes, bigger isn't always better. It's always good to be able to use just one hand to hold and navigate the phone, especially if you're a multitasker. This is why smaller versions of popular smartphones are always worth a second look, like the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact and the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini.\n\nWith the Xperia Z3 Compact, you get all the care and attention Sony gave to the Z3, just in a more petite package, while the Galaxy S4 Mini has some of the S4's standout features.\n\nHere, we compare the two devices.\n\nDesign:\n\nThe Xperia Z3 Compact has the same aesthetic as its predecessor, with the same glass front and back and Sony Xperia branding. The phone measures 5 x 2.56 x 0.34 inches and weighs 4.55 ounces. It's completely waterproof, and it can be submerged in up to 4.9 feet of water for 30 minutes. A camera shutter button on the edge of the phone allows you to take pictures underwater.\n\nThe Galaxy S4 Mini takes its design cues from the S4, with the same rounded edges, silver sides, and plastic backing in white or black. The phone measures 4.9 x 2.4 x 0.4 inches and weighs 3.8 ounces.\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe Xperia Z3 Compact has a 4.6-inch display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, while the Galaxy S4 Mini has a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels.\n\nThe Sony handset has the superior camera, which is a 20.7 megapixels shooter. The Samsung phone's main camera is at 8MP. For the ubiquitous selfie, the Sony phone also takes better pictures -- it has a 2.2MP front-facing shooter versus the Samsung's 1.9MP camera.\n\nThe Xperia Z3 Compact comes with 16GB internal memory, while the Galaxy S4 Mini comes with 8GB storage. However, both phones come with a microSD card slot, allowing you to expand the Sony phone's storage to 128GB and the Samsung phone's memory up to 64GB.\n\nPrice:\n\nOff contract, the Xperia Z3 Compact costs $488.99, while the Galaxy S4 Mini costs $218.", "The Internet giant says its video tutorial service isn't growing fast enough.\n\nGoogle announced Friday it is shuttering Helpouts because the 1-year old video tutorial service isn't growing as fast as the company wants.\n\n\"The Helpouts community includes some engaged and loyal contributors, but unfortunately, it hasn't grown at the pace we had expected,\" reads a blog post about the shutdown.\n\nGoogle launched Helpouts in November 2013 as a way for people with expertise to market their services through instructional videos that offered one-on-one help for viewers. Essentially a video chat between two parties, some tutorial sessions were free and some were paid. Sessions included guitar lessons, counseling, medical advice and cooking lessons.\n\nConsumers will no longer be able to take a Helpout after April 19. On April 20, users can download their Helpouts history using Google Takeout. This download option will be available until November 1.\n\nThe Internet giant was trying to capture a slice of the video tutorial marketplace. While the Google name may have lent some legitimacy to the content, the company was up against a slew of free tutorial videos available on its own video-sharing site YouTube. Google wasn't the only company experimenting with one-on-one video services. Amazon in September launched Mayday, a tech support feature for Kindles that connects a user to a customer service representative. The e-commerce giant has had more luck with the feature -- with lets users ask for any kind of technical help, including ordering a pizza online -- and often boasting about its customer reviews of the experience.\n\nGoogle created a similar experience for Samsung's Chromebook 2, which launched with a tech support service powered by Helpouts. It's unclear what will happen to that feature. Google didn't immediately return a request for comment.", "Nokia, on Monday, announced the launch of its first Android range of phones- the Nokia X, Nokia X + and Nokia Xl which substitute Microsoft software in place of the standard Google software.\"Today we announce the launch of a new family of phones that will help us target the lower range of the mobile market, said former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who is now Executive Vice President.\n\nWhile the Nokia X and Nokia X + are smaller phones, the Nokia XL comes with a 5 inch screen. While the Nokia X is 89 euros. The X + is priced at 99 euros and the XL is priced at 109 euros.\n\nThe phones come with a host of Nokia and Microsoft services - cloud, an App Store that connects both Android and other stores like Yandex.\n\nSony showcases phone with ultra-HD video recording\n\nSony is borrowing innovations from its audio and camcorder businesses and incorporating its new Xperia Z2 smartphone with noise-cancelling technology and ultra-high-definition video recording.\n\nNoise cancellation works with an in-ear headset sold separately for 60 euros ($82), while the Z2's built-in camera can capture video in so-called 4K resolution, an emerging standard that offers four times the details as current high-definition video.\n\nKazuo Hirai, president and CEO of Sony Corp., described Sony's new lineup as \"products that are built on the shoulders of 60 years of design, engineering and artistic excellence.\"\n\nMonday's announcement at the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain, comes just weeks after Sony said it was selling its Vaio personal computer operations and making its Bravia TV business a subsidiary company. Sony also plans to cut its global workforce by about 3 per cent, or 5,000 people, by the end of March 2015.\n\nSony, once an electronics powerhouse when its Walkman music players defined what portable gadgets should be, has had difficulty keeping up with Samsung and other rivals in various consumer electronics.\n\nPhones are no different. Despite favorable reviews, Sony phones haven't had much traction in an industry dominated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.\n\nWith the Z2, Sony is trying to innovate on hardware, while many of the groundbreaking features in rival devices have been in their software.\n\nThe Z2 sports the same 20.7 megapixel camera found in its predecessors, the Z1 and the Z1s. Most other smartphone cameras have 8 to 13 megapixels. The Z2 is waterproof, like the Z1 phones, and its screen is slightly larger, at 5.2 inches diagonally instead of 5 inches.\n\nAt Monday's announcement event, Sony also demonstrated a SmartBand fitness accessory that works with a Lifelog app on the phone to record your day. You see key moments on a timeline, including photos taken and messages sent and received. As your day progresses on the timeline, you see the number of steps and calories burned to that point.\n\nSony also announced a high-end tablet and a separate, mid-range smartphone.\n\nThe tablet is also called the Xperia Z2 and features a 10.1-inch screen, larger than most full -- size tablets. It is also waterproof. The Wi-Fi-only model weights 426 grams (0.94 pound), which is lighter than Apple's lightweight iPad Air, despite the Z2's larger size.\n\nSony's Xperia M2, meanwhile, is meant as a cheaper alternative to the Z2. Its camera isn't as powerful, at only 8 megapixels, and the screen is only 4.8 inches. Still, the camera is the same as what the iPhone offers, and it's larger than the iPhone's 4 inches.", "The NBA is set to capture all the main All-Star Weekend action in virtual reality.\n\nHighlight packages from each event will be available through Samsung's Milk VR\u2122 and will allow fans to view NBA action through a 360-degree immersive video experience.\n\n\"With basketball enthusiasts all over the world, it's paramount that we explore new ways to bring fans even closer to the game,\" said Jeff Marsilio, NBA Vice President of Global Media Distribution. \"Virtual reality delivers amazing vantage points like the NBA All-Star Game from a courtside seat or Sprite Slam Dunk from the baseline.

I have no doubt that she will do a fantastic job of educating, socializing and preparing her children for a future that will contribute to their success and the success of their community. She should receive a little provincial funding. Something similar, but very different is happening in some southern Alberta Mennonite communities. They are also educating their own kids. Not so much home schooling as it is community schooling. They should not receive provincial funding. Don't get me wrong. I think that, just like my friend on The Island, these Mennonites are free to teach the children within their community as they see fit. What's right, wrong, reading, math, science, Jesus, dinosaurs, or Santa. I love to see a community supporting itself. But it's a private community, so there shouldn't be public dollars attached.

How do you think competitors may respond to this?"]}, "BASF": {"2015-02-12": ["The lingering Eurozone crisis has brought with it a decline in the value of the euro vs. the U.S. dollar. With the economic situation in Europe still shaky, the European Central Bank (ECB) has initiated a strategy of quantitative easing to spur growth. At the same time, problems in Greece have not gone away, and the new Greek government is threatening to exit the euro currency. All of these things are likely to keep the euro low for some time to come, and as with most things, there will be winners and losers in the U.S. economy. (See also, Will The ECB's Quantitative Easing Sink The Euro?)\n\nImporters of European goods. Companies that use European parts as inputs will find their supply chains becoming more affordable. Transportation companies that purchase European cars and trucks will benefit by adding to their fleet at a reduced cost. Similarly, airlines that buy their planes from Airbus or other European aircraft manufacturers will do so at better-than-usual prices. This can help boost profit margins for these firms.\n\nU.S. consumers. American consumers will find that imported consumables, such as fine wines and cheeses from France and Italy, have become more affordable. German cars, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen, will all become less expensive at showrooms in the U.S.\n\nInvestors in European companies that do big business in the U.S. American investors are able to buy shares of foreign companies through ADRs which are listed on U.S. stock exchanges. European ADRs of companies that have a large presence in the U.S. may benefit by increasing sales here. Bayer, the German producer of over-the-counter drugs, reports that a 1% depreciation of the euro could increase company sales by \u20ac260 million. Airbus could see a $1 billion boost in profits for every 0.10 decline in the euro, and chemical manufacturer BASF forecasts an extra \u20ac50 million in earnings for every one cent the euro drops.\n\nTourists and travelers to Europe. When the euro is weak, it means the dollar must be strong relatively speaking. Tourists and business travelers will see their dollar go farther while abroad. U.S. companies who regularly send employees to Europe for business will also benefit from cheaper accommodations. Ex-pats who live in European cities but earn dollars will also see their cost of living go down.\n\nExporters to Europe. U.S. companies that export to Europe will lose out as their products become more expensive for European buyers. Companies such as beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), tobacco companies like Philip Morris (PM), fast food chains including McDonalds (MCD), and consumer electronics and appliance producers like Harman International (HAR) all rely on sales to European customers as a large portion of their annual revenues. These companies may see their profitability suffer as a result. Investors in domestic companies that have large exposure to the European market should be wary.\n\nThe U.S. tourism industry. Tourism may suffer as American destinations become more expensive for European citizens. While it is true that the industry has reported fewer European travelers visiting the U.S. each year for the past few years, tourists from other parts of the world such as Asia and South America have reduced the negative impact of fewer Europeans. Ex-pats from Europe living in America but earning euros will see their cost of living increase.\n\nThe weakening of the euro against the dollar has created both winners and losers in America, and there is potential that the euro value may continue to slide. While importers and consumers of European goods will benefit, U.S. exporters to Europe will lose out. U.S. travelers to Europe will find that their dollar goes further, but Europeans may avoid traveling to America as their euros will buy less.

The apple won't be at grocery stores yet, though this was its last major regulatory hurdle. The company is still waiting on the conclusion of a voluntary review by the FDA before the apple can enter the market place.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMost apples start browning when the flesh is exposed to air or damaged. But the Canadian company behind the Arctic Apple says its browning-free variety will mean less food waste, more uses for cut apples and the preservation of nutrients.\n\nOkanagan can now provide its trees to growers to ramp up production so the apple can make it to market and potentially get picked up for use by consumers, restaurant chains and grocery stores.\n\nThe apples could find their way into millions of Happy Meals and sit out on salad bars -- without having been sprayed with citric acid, which is how other apples are kept from browning now.\n\nSmall companies and universities have been hesitant to go through the USDA process for taking genetically engineered foods to market because approvals take so long -- and the products aren't making any money in the meantime. But the apple's approval could be a test case that could spur the industry on.\n\nThe biotechnology space is the domain of large companies, like Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer and Syngenta. For a small company that lacks lobbyists and political clout \"to actually break into this arena is challenging, and to be unnecessarily delayed is impediment enough that folks will say 'why would I go down that path.'\" said Jennifer Armen, Okanagan's marketing director.\n\nBut the approval of a genetically modified apple for mass consumption also stokes the debate about GMOs, which have spawned legislation and regulation throughout the country.\n\nBiotechnology has been used to enhance plants for more than 30 years, and millions of acres of government-approved GE corn, soybeans, cotton and canola are in production. However, genetically engineered produce like the Arctic Apple are uncommon, and the road it took to secure approval from USDA's Biotechnology Regulatory Service was even longer than usual.\n\nIt took nearly 36 months for BRS to grant Okanagan's petition for deregulation under the federal Plant Pest Act. That's nearly three times BRS' 13 to 15 month average.\n\nMichael Firko, BRS' deputy administrator, in November declined to comment on why the Arctic Apple was taking so long to garner his agency's seal of approval.\n\nBut the Arctic Apple isn't like most of the products that go through Firko's office.\n\nNearly all of BRS' approvals have been for one of six major crops: corn, soybeans, cotton, canola, alfalfa and sugar beets. And the genetic enhancements approved have been for pest or herbicide resistance. What's more, most other GMO applications submitted to USDA are from the same big six biotech companies -- Monsanto, Dow AgroSciences, Syngenta, DuPont Pioneer, Bayer Crop Sciences and BASF.\n\nOkanagan is a new player, and its apple is a novelty: It contains traits meant to help consumers, not farmers.\n\nFor any item, gaining regulatory approval isn't easy. The average time from initial discovery to commercial launch is 13.1 years, according to a 2011 study by CropLife International, with regulatory proceedings accounting for more than one-third of that time.\n\nThe process is also pricey. CropLife found the average cost of commercializing a biotech plant trait from 2008 to 2012 was $136 million. Of that, about $35 million was for regulatory testing and registration, $31 million for discovery and $70 million for development.\n\nAs time-consuming and expensive as it is for every biotech product, the challenge is nearly insurmountable for small, innovative enterprises like Okanagan, which has six employees and survives on venture capital, said Karen Batra, a spokeswoman for the Biotechnology Industry Organization.\n\nFirko is quick to dismiss such concerns. \"I think this is kind of a myth that has been created\" that commercializing a GE product is a rich man's game, he said, adding that BRS is \"happy to accept a petition from anyone.\"\n\nWhile BRS considered the Arctic Apple, the agency made a decision on eight of 11 other biotech products submitted after Okanagan -- the other three are still pending. But it is not BRS' job to encourage companies to develop biotech crops, just to regulate them, Firko added.\n\nOne of the few products pending longer than the Arctic Apple is ArborGen's freeze-resistant eucalyptus tree, submitted in January 2011. The tree is undergoing a stricter environmental review because it's the first GE tree to seek approval.\n\nWhen the South Carolina-based tree breeder first considered seeking regulatory approval in the late 2000s, the company expected an 18-month to two-year wait, said Les Pearson, director of regulatory affairs for the company.\n\n\"We assumed that over time the process would become more efficient,\" Pearson said. \"The 30-plus years of experience [of USDA] with the technology should be a factor in making the [regulatory] decision and somehow that has been missing.\"\n\nA tougher sell\n\nOnce approved, new GMO products face sales hurdles.\n\nThe big biotech players know that herbicide- and pest-resistant plants have proven profitable, and farmers, the primary customers for biotech crop companies, are quick to adopt the technology with its promise of lower chemical inputs and low or no tillage.\n\nA consumer-facing trait is a tougher sell, said Susan Knowlton, a DuPont Pioneer senior research manager. Biotech companies need to convince food makers that consumers will accept the products.\n\nIn the 1990s, customer pressure led McDonald's to stop using a potato modified to resist certain diseases in its french fries, and the fast food giant has been noncommittal on whether it will use a non-browning potato developed by spud-giant J.R. Simplot that gained USDA signoff late last year.\n\nFriends of the Earth urged McDonald's and baby food maker Gerber to reject the Arctic Apple, arguing that it is not being sufficiently tested for safety. Another advocacy group, Food & Water Watch, responded Friday to USDA's approval of the Arctic Apple with similar disdain.\n\n\"This GMO apple is simply unnecessary,\" the group said. \"... The USDA has let down U.S. apple growers and the public by wasting resources on this useless and risky food.\"\n\nDuPont's Plenish soybean is one of the few examples of a major biotech company commercializing a nutrition-based trait, but even that has been slow going. The soybean, approved by USDA in June 2010 after more than three years of review, is modified to produce oil that does not need to be hydrogenated to stay shelf stable, making it trans fat free. The oil is being tested by food companies whose interest was bolstered after FDA's announcement in 2013 that wants to phase out trans fats.\n\nKnowlton said at least one retail product has already started using its GMO soybean oil, though she could not disclose it due to a confidentiality agreement.\n\nLawmakers are also putting increased attention on GMO foods. On Thursday, bills that would require the labeling of genetically engineered ingredients in food were reintroduced in both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe expense, risk and regulatory delays are pushing small GMO technology companies to look more at overseas markets.\n\nWith no predictable regulatory approval process in the United States, ArborGen has developed a \"very strong interest in Brazil,\" Pearson said.\n\nBrazil's law governing GE plants was passed in 2005, and officials there are still working toward fully implementing the measure. But Brazilian authorities seem to be more open to biotechnology, Pearson said, issuing approvals for some products that have yet to be deregulated in the United States and expressing interest in working with biotech companies.\n\nIt's not just GE crop producers looking to Brazil. The country also has been more open to GE animals, approving the release of mosquitoes modified to prevent the spread of dengue fever and funding a project to develop goats whose milk can prevent childhood diarrhea.\n\nIn the United States, however, the FDA, which regulates genetically modified animals, has yet to allow any into the market. AquaBounty Technologies, a Waltham, Mass.-based company that has created a GE salmon that grows at twice the rate of conventional varieties, first started the process for regulatory approval in 2003.\n\nJames Murray, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, working on the goat, said the project moved to Brazil because \"the regulatory environment here has made it very difficult to even fund the work.\"\n\n\"If Brazil wants to fund the work and we have colleges there that want to do the work,\" then that's where biotech projects will go, Murray said.", "(Bloomberg) -- German stocks rose above 11,000 for the first time, buoyed by data that showed the economy accelerated at the end of last year.\n\nThe DAX Index climbed to as high as 11,013.85 and was up 52.28 points to 10,971.93 as of 10:39 a.m. in Frankfurt. The index rallied, lifting European stocks higher, after a report showed German gross domestic product surged 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Equity gains were led by BASF SE and by lenders Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG.\n\n\"11,000 has psychological importance,\" said John Plassard, vice president at Mirabaud Securities LLP in Geneva. \"This confirms the role of economic leader of Germany in the euro area. The domestic demand has allowed Germany to come out of a slowdown. If we break this level, we could go much higher.\"\n\nGerman equities have risen 12 percent this year, with the European Central Bank's pledge for quantitative easing helping the index outperform 23 other developed market peers. A lower euro, growing economy and optimism the crisis in Ukraine has stabilized is fueling investor's optimism.\n\nGrowth in Europe's biggest economy growth was driven by domestic demand, with exports and imports both rising strongly. That's helped companies including Daimler AG, which sees at least a 10 percent gain in 2015 profit. The stock's 21 percent year-to-date gain is among Germany's best.\n\nHeidelbergCement AG, the world's third-biggest cement maker, advanced 19 percent this year after reporting profit that was buoyed by residential construction in North America.\n\nPrivate consumption rose markedly in the fourth quarter, and investment developed positively, driven by a significant increase in construction output, Germany's Federal Statistics Office said.", "Germany's benchmark DAX-30 stock index has hit a record high, crashing through the 11,000-point barrier. The surge came on the back of fresh hope that a solution may be found for Greece's debt problem.\n\nHope for a eurozone agreement on how to deal with Greece's debt load and save the country from bankruptcy as well as some movement in the conflict over Ukraine saw Germany's DAX index rise by 0.5 percent within the first few minutes of trading on Friday.\n\nAbout an hour later, the benchmark index exceeded 11,000 points on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange for the first time, marking an interim gain of 0.8 percent.\n\nAmong the biggest winners in early trading were chemicals giant BASF and Deutsche Post, logging gains of around 1 percent each. But the picture was anything but heterogeneous, with shares of steel giant ThyssenKrupp plunging by 2.6 percent despite a positive outlook presented by the company earlier on Friday.\n\nCheap money a driving force\n\nA new record high of 11,013 points in the morning meant the DAX had surged by a staggering 17 percent since the beginning of the year.\n\nFriday's rise also came on the back of new statistical data saying that Germany's economy grew by 0.7 percent in the final quarter of 2014, indicating fresh momentum in Europe's powerhouse.\n\n\"Central banks have been flooding capital markets with cheap money,\" Orca Capital portfolio manager Ludwig Donnert told DPA news agency. \"There's no sound alternative to investing in stocks, making indices going from strength to strength.\""]}, "Apple": {"2015-02-12": ["SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low.

They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said.

But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.", "TAG Heuer is set to enter uncharted territory this year with plans for a smartwatch that will be its only timepiece developed outside Switzerland.\n\nThe brand and others based in the Alpine country will need to work with partners in Silicon Valley to produce such watches as Switzerland lacks the technological expertise to do so itself, according to Jean-Claude Biver, head of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA's timepiece unit.\n\n\"We're not in the communications industry, Switzerland is not, we don't have the technology,\" Biver, 65, said in an interview at his home near the lakeside city of Montreux last week. \"If you don't have it, you can't innovate.\"\n\nSynonymous with timekeeping for centuries, the nation's watch industry has traditionally used \"Swiss Made\" as a marketing tool to boost the bonafides of its products, arguing that the term goes hand-in-hand with quality, expertise and innovation. With the imminent introduction of the Apple Watch, the industry faces a challenge to those values.\n\nTAG Heuer, which boasts that \"Swiss Made is more than a label at TAG Heuer, it's a state of mind,\" is developing its own smartwatch to help stave off the impact of the American product, which poses the biggest threat for watches priced at less than $2,000, Biver said.\n\n'DIFFERENT CRAFTSMANSHIP'\n\nFor a smartwatch, \"we can't produce the engine, the chips, the applications, the hardware -- nobody can produce it in Switzerland,\" Biver said. \"The hardware and the software will come from Silicon Valley. But the watch case, the dial, the design, the idea, the crown, that part of the watch will, of course, be Swiss.\"\n\nFifty percent of a watch's movements need to be produced in the country in order to win the \"Swiss Made\" label at present. But the expertise is limited to mechanical know-how, Biver said.\n\nBiver has split TAG Heuer's research and development business into two departments to reflect the \"different craftsmanship.\" One department focuses on research and development with watchmakers and watch engineers, the other with engineers of technology. TAG Heuer will be able to reveal partnerships it has formed with other companies to create its smartwatch in the next six weeks, he said.\n\nIn addition to functionality expected of a smartwatch -- think GPS and health monitoring -- TAG Heuer's timepiece will have applications that are specific to its own brand to give it a unique selling point, he said, such as tie-ups with sports it sponsors.\n\nAPPLE WATCH\n\nBiver has led brands through transformation before. As CEO of Hublot, he led the introduction of \"The Big Bang,\" a chronograph that helped the brand to boost revenue under his tenure. Earlier, the executive turned around a moribund brand, Blancpain. He later sold it to Swatch Group AG, and was there tasked with restructuring the Omega label.\n\nThe Apple Watch is only one of the threats to the industry this year, following the Swiss National Bank's decision last week to end the minimum exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro. The subsequent surge in the franc means that timepieces that are made in Switzerland will be more expensive when exported outside of the country, as all but a fraction are.\n\nThe smartwatch market will probably reach about $10 billion in 2018 from as much as $1.8 billion in 2014, Citigroup, Inc. analysts forecast last year, with half of the market in the future coming from traditional watch wearers switching to the tech devices.\n\nOne person who plans on wearing the Apple Watch is likely Biver himself, he said.\n\n\"It's a fantastic product, an incredible achievement,\" he said. \"I'm not just living in the tradition and culture and the past, I also want to be connected to the future. The Apple Watch connects me to the future. My watch connects me to history, to eternity.\"", "A mobile strategy in Asia is essential, and getting the user experience right is just as important.\n\nIt had long been predicted, but 2014 was the year mobile Internet access finally overtook desktop for the first time on a global scale. Mobile marketing is hugely important wherever your business operates, but it can be absolutely vital in key Asian markets.\n\nIndia and China both reached their own mobile tipping points in 2012 and according to the ITU, the UN's agency for ICT statistics, Asia and the Pacific have the highest number of mobile broadband subscriptions, more than 750 million by 2014.\n\nResearch from the Google Consumer Barometer, meanwhile, found that Singapore (85 percent) and South Korea (80 percent) had the highest smartphone penetration rates.\n\nMany Asian markets also have significant numbers of consumers who accessed the Internet exclusively via their smartphones. Thirty-five percent of Malaysian consumers, 24 percent of Vietnamese, and 16 percent of Singaporeans only access the Internet using their phones.\n\nDespite this, it's clear that many businesses are still not optimizing their websites for mobile.\n\nJulian Persaud, managing director of Google Southeast Asia, says 88 percent of Singaporeans have experienced problems when accessing websites on their phones, \"so clearly there's a lot more work to be done. It's vital for every business to think mobile-first.\"\n\n\"This is a massive wake-up call to any business in Singapore without a mobile-optimized site or app. This is no longer a viable approach - you're effectively slamming your shop door in the face of your customers.\"\n\nWhether you're adapting your existing website to work better when accessed on a mobile device or designing a site exclusively for mobile, you should be aware that some things that work well on desktop might not be as effective on a smaller screen.\n\nOnly a third of mobile users make it past the first page of a site they visit, so it's important to place important information, calls to action, and clear navigation options as prominently as possible on the landing page.\n\nPage-loading time is another huge issue. Almost half of mobile users expect a website to load within two seconds and 40 percent are likely to abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nCutting down on large photo files and auto-loading sound and video files can help reduce loading-times, as well as making your display design easier to get right. It's worth remembering that Apple doesn't support Flash and, with the iPhone currently enjoying an upsurge in Asia, it might be best to avoid Flash altogether.\n\nSome designers still use a separate m. domain to direct mobile visitors to a just-for-mobile site, but in 2015 this is looking increasingly old-fashioned. There are still benefits, as this approach can allow you to create a desktop website that can incorporate elements that simply wouldn't work on mobile.\n\nFor most businesses, however, responsive design offers a simpler solution.\n\nResponsive websites automatically resize and adjust their display parameters so that they display correctly on a range of different devices. This can allow you to maintain a single domain for desktop and mobile, but stringent testing is important. It also means your design must be suitable for both desktop and mobile visitors in terms of navigation and content.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch is using this technique to target Asian customers, so it will be interesting to see how successful this approach becomes.\n\nThe way people navigate around a site they are visiting on mobile can differ considerably from the way they navigate around the same site on desktop.\n\nThe main input device in mobile is usually a finger, which is much less precise than a mouse cursor. Make navigation buttons clear and large enough to use. Avoid clustering small hot spots together as it can be easy to tap the wrong one and also steer clear of text links that can be even more difficult to use on a smaller screen.\n\nYou might also consider putting more information on a single page. Mobile users often don't like to scroll too far, but this can still be preferable than having to click through to different pages. If you build in an infinite scroll feature, which auto-loads more results or information as the viewer approaches the bottom of the page, it can be useful to include a static \"Return to top\" button.\n\nOne handy way for people to navigate your site is the inclusion of a \"Site search\" box. This can be particularly useful if, for example, you have a range of products that people might want to browse.\n\nAn auto-complete or suggestion feature can help cut down the amount of text that users actually have to type into the box - and getting the right translation partner to help with this can make all the difference.\n\nAgain, incorporate a \"Return\" or \"Back\" button that allows users to easily return to the landing page or to previous results. When you consider the rapid growth of mobile Internet use, it's clearly important to give your users the best experience you can when they visit your site.\n\nOptimizing for mobile can help you tap into the mobile revolution and increase your competitive edge.\n\nImage via Shutterstock.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online.

They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nBarra was joined Thursday by Bin Lin, Xiaomi's co-founder and president, at the company's first major press event in the United States.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Barra described the U.S. website as \"an experimental launch\" that will help the company raise awareness in the U.S., which in turn would help its profile in other countries. He said the company also is hoping to get the kind of feedback and ideas from U.S. consumers that the company gathers in China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and six other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The company plans to expand into Brazil later this year. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Lin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for about $13. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nXiaomi is just dipping its toes in the U.S. market by selling accessories for now, including headphones for about $80. Barra said it takes \"an incredible amount of work\" to bring more technologically complicated products, such as a smartphone, to a new market. He didn't say when that might happen.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying - or at least closely imitating - some designs from Apple or other companies. At the San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. They range from games and messaging features to services that let users search for a nearby doctor and make an appointment on their phone.\n\nWhen asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Lin implied that it's not a big factor for the company. But he said, \"all companies have had patent litigation.\" He said Xiaomi has filed for hundreds of patents in part to beef up its own defenses against such claims.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Lin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Instead, Xiaomi will sell its lesser-known ancillary products such as headphones and its Mi Band wearable fitness tracker.\n\nRelated stories CNET reviews Xiaomi's slick Mi Note Mi Note sells out in under three minutes Xiaomi, China's largest smartphone vendor\n\nAn online store signifies the first step towards its eagerly anticipated entry into the US market. While not a household name, Xiaomi has steadily built up its reputation among the tech savvy as \"the Apple of China\" with affordable and slick-designed devices packed with high-end components, all with price tags that are sometimes half that of its competitors' products. Further adding to the hype is its position as the world's most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $45 billion. But the Western markets represent a different beast -- one where consumers gravitate to the biggest names like Apple and Samsung.\n\nHugo Barra, a former Google executive who left the search company to join Xiaomi as vice president of international operations in 2013, said the company wants to be calculated and careful when bringing its flagship products to new markets. It's a now-recurring theme for the start-up that considers itself an Internet services company -- not just a handset maker.\n\n\"The amount of effort required to bring those products [phones and tablets] to market is significant. We just have to move at the right pace,\" Barra told the audience. \"So we're accelerating our entry in a sense by bringing simpler products.\" Barra cited factors like manufacturing, packaging, regulations and the software hurdles with a language gap for the slow arrival of Xiaomi phones in Western markets.\n\nGlass-clad Xiaomi Mi Note sparkles (pict...

The pace of that growth has many wondering when Xiaomi will expand to markets where Apple and Samsung have captured large percentages of the market. Xiaomi prefers to take its time.\n\nXiaomi's strategy of launching an online store echoes similar plays run by fellow Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Alcatel. While these companies supply cheaper smartphones to prepaid customers through their carrier relationships, they are attempting to push their higher end flagship smartphones directly to consumers through their own online presence.\n\nXiaomi, however, is moving even more gingerly, holding off on its marquee smartphone products for now.", "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Xiaomi [XTC.UL], China's largest smartphone company, will begin selling headphones, smart wristbands and other accessories online in the United States in coming months, taking its first tentative step onto Apple Inc's home turf without its signature Mi mobile devices.\n\nThe company also said it is close to securing a manufacturing partner in Brazil, which will help it skirt punishing tariffs on imported electronics when it begins sales in Latin America's largest economy in the first half of this year.\n\nXiaomi, a five-year-old upstart whose name means \"Little Rice,\" came out of nowhere to become China's fastest-selling mobile brand. It has been rapidly expanding its global footprint through direct, online sales.\n\nThe company was valued at $45 billion (29 billion pounds) in a December funding round that drew investors ranging from Singapore's sovereign wealth fund to a private capital firm backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd co-founder Jack Ma.\n\nIts Mi devices, which scored with Chinese users because of their low cost and the company's heavy reliance on user interaction and feedback, are now sold online across Asia, including most recently India.\n\nBrazil marks the company's first foray with smartphones outside of its home continent. Global operations vice president Hugo Barra said Xiaomi intends to begin selling its phones there in the first half of this year.\n\nThe company is in \"extremely advanced discussions\" with at least half a dozen manufacturing partners there, Barra, a former Google Inc executive, said without revealing names, which will help it side-step a roughly 60 percent tax on foreign electronics.\n\nThe industry is particularly curious about Xiaomi's potential to make a dent in the United States, which is the world's biggest mobile market in dollar terms but one where phone sales are controlled by telecoms carriers and where Apple holds sway.\n\nCo-founder and President Lin Bin told reporters on Thursday that Xiaomi will launch its first online sales site, Mi.com, in a few months, directly selling items from earphones to smart bands to American consumers.\n\nThe company is eschewing bigger-ticket items like phones and tablets for now partly because of the United States' carrier-sales and phone subsidy structure, which eliminates Xiaomi's cost advantage. More generally, Bin and Barra talked about the time and effort needed to tailor its MIUI Android-based operating systems for individual markets and obtain certification, among other things.\n\nXiaomi's main intention for now is to engage American consumers and try and build a community there the same way it has in China and India - through fan events, interaction with users on social media such as a dedicated Facebook page, and gradually coming to know both local preferences and building its brand.\n\nFor example, Barra told Reuters how Xiaomi might put its self-branded headphones in front of U.S. audiophiles and tweak the product depending on their detailed feedback.\n\n\"We're keen on being in the conversation in the U.S.,\" he told reporters.\n\n(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nChina s Xiaomi to start small in U.S., with earphones and bands - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "American companies have about $2 trillion in overseas accounts -- money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States.

However the more powerful hardware also meant that apps could become more complex and go beyond what we have seen since smartphones started to become mainstream.\n\nThe good news for those looking for more complex apps is that Apple has recently announced that they are now increasing the maximum app size from 2GB to 4GB, basically allowing developers to release apps that could be as big as 4GB in size. This will no doubt come in handy for more complex apps, such as graphics intensive games that might need to extra space, or to create games that have longer playtimes.\n\n\"The size limit of an app package submitted through iTunes Connect has increased from 2 GB to 4 GB, so you can include more media in your submission and provide a more complete, rich user experience upon installation.\" However Apple notes that this does not change the cellular network delivery size, which at the moment is limited to 100MB since we doubt anyone wants to blow through their data allowance with a single app, right?\n\nWe're not sure which developers will be taking advantage of these changes, but a couple of years ago Square Enix cited the app size limit of 2GB as one of the reasons why an iOS version is years away from being ported, although in Japan gamers can play the game on their phone thanks to the Dive In video game streaming service.", "Xiaomi, the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, is coming stateside, but not in the way pundits expected.\n\nThe company announced at a conference Thursday that its e-commerce website, Mi.com, could start selling products to U.S. customers in five months. Surprisingly, smartphones will not be among them -- at least, at first.\n\nInstead, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi's Global VP, suggested the company might start with items such as a recently-launched pair of headphones and its popular external battery pack, the latter of which sold 15 million units in 2014. The company has no immediate plans for bringing its handsets to the U.S., he added.\n\n\"We might try things in small volumes and see how it goes,\" Barra told Mashable. The former Google VP, who managed Android development before joining Xiaomi in 2013, said the Chinese company might also use social media polls to see which products might sell well stateside. \"We'll actually gain a lot of experience from selling these products here because we'll get a lot of feedback that will actually be globally relevant for us.\"\n\nThat may be true, but rolling out in the U.S. initially with several accessories instead of its cash cow is a pretty safe way for Xiaomi to better understand the U.S. market and decide the best distribution channels without betting the farm. Is launching Mi.com in America enough? How much of an in-store presence should Xiaomi have, if any?\n\nXiaomi's experimental U.S. launch also affords the company a testbed for marketing. While Xiaomi has fast become the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, second only to Apple and Samsung, Xiaomi remains virtually unknown to mainstream America.\n\nThe smartphone maker must also shake a reputation for emulating Apple's hardware and software design, albeit at much lower prices. Its new, flagship smartphone, the Mi Note, technically trumps Apple's latest smartphones spec-for-spec but bears a pretty close resemblance to the iPhone 6 Plus. In fact, the Note's most differentiating feature may be price: at $329 without a carrier contract, the Mi Note costs less than half of an unlocked iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe company's challenge in the U.S market isn't just around building a U.S. presence but setting itself apart from Apple, as well as the hundreds of affordable Android devices up for grabs. If Xiaomi actually finds a way to accomplish all those things, it may realize its ambitious goal of having a true global presence.\n\n\"We have world class products available at awesome prices, so why not bring them here?\" Barra said. \"We needed to build momentum and a team with international skills to be able to do something like this. We're not there yet, but we'll be there in a few months.\"", "Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story. (***)", "What if you could complain directly to Google about every little thing that bothered you about the Android operating system? And what if every time you complained, Google fixed a bug just for you?\n\nThe Chinese handset maker, Xiaomi, has built an empire of 100 million users worldwide on this exact premise. \"We're an Internet company,\" said Bin Lin, President of Xiaomi, at a press event on Thursday. \"We're not just interested in making handsets.\"\n\nWhile it's true that Xiaomi has been particularly successful selling directly to customers rather than through other retailers or carriers, that's not what Lin was referring to. He was boasting about the company's massive user base overseas, which has grown rapidly thanks to savvy social media tactics. \"They are not our customers, they are our fans,\" added Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who left in 2012 to serve as Vice President of Global Operations at Xiaomi.\n\nXiaomi has gone to great lengths to accommodate these \"fans.\" For instance, when the company launched its first ROM in 2010, there were only 100 users, but after it started making devices and its marketshare grew, Xiaomi honored those that had stuck with them from the beginning by printing their name in the MIUI boot loader.\n\nThen there was the time a fan requested that Xiaomi make it easier to turn on the flashlight from the Lock screen. He argued that his parents wouldn't have caught him coming home drunk if he wouldn't have made such a racket dropping his keys. A week later, the developers pushed out a software update that included that exact feature. \"Everything we do is with social as a platform,\" said Barra. \"Every market we enter has its differences, but at the core everyone is social, everyone is emotional, everyone loves to be spoken to -- to be marketed at.\"\n\nXiaomi's entrance into the U.S. mobile market will incorporate some of the tactics that have made it famous overseas. Although the company won't initially sell phones and tablets -- Barra said \"the amount of effort required to bring those products to market is significant\" -- it does plan to appeal to U.S. customers (sorry, fans) in a similar manner. Barra cited its recent success in India. \"When we entered India, we didn't know how things were going to turn out. India got it. They understood what we were coming to market with...We were bringing more than anyone had ever brought.\"\n\nUnlike India, the US already has \"more.\" It has Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG, Microsoft, and a whole array of manufacturers vying for marketshare. It also has carriers; most customers don't buy smartphones and tablets directly from the manufacturer when they can get the device subsidized from their cellular provider. There's incentive there that Xiaomi will have to compete with, not to mention a pattern that users have become accustomed to ever since mobile phones became a necessity.\n\nThere's also the question of how Xiaomi plans to market to the everyman -- users that aren't necessarily \"in the know,\" but who do a little research for their bi-annual phone upgrades. I asked Barra about this -- about how he'd get someone like my Mom onboard the Xiaomi train -- and he bluntly answered, \"You'll buy her one.\" Essentially, Xiaomi is banking on its existing \"fans\" to convert their friends and family members, too.\n\nUnfortunately, we won't get to see Xiaomi's plan in action for some time, since it's limited on what it can sell here in the U.S. But the company is very optimistic about its future stateside. \"Building a fan base [in the U.S.] is no different than how we built a fan base in India,\" said Lin. \"Driving marketshare and having a great experience...is really the most important goal for us.\"", "We didn't get to see a top-secret new tablet or hear plans to sell phones in the U.S, but that doesn't mean that Xiaomi's stop in Silicon Valley was without revelations.\n\nFirst, the company said it plans to start selling accessories in the U.S., even if it won't sell big ticket items here. Also, not only doesn't it plan an IPO this year, it doesn't have one on the road map any time soon.\n\nBut, there were other interesting tidbits scattered through the long presentation from Hugo Barra and Bin Lin, as well as the ensuing question-and-answer period.\n\nXiaomi may be the third-biggest phone maker in the world, but it thinks of itself as an Internet company. In part, that's because the company makes little to no money from its devices, but one day hopes to cash in on the huge community it has built by selling paid-for services. That effort is in its infancy through things like phone themes and other add-ons.\n\nGeographically, Lin says, the company is targeting places with big populations and a growing appetite for e-commerce. Brazil is already in the works and due to launch later this year. Russia is high on Lin's list, along with the Middle East, other parts of Latin America and other parts of Asia.\n\nIntellectual property concern, Lin conceded, is a factor, but a lesser one than those others, he said. He said that all phone makers have to deal with patent issues and Xiaomi is not alone in that area. There is widespread speculation that the company will avoid launching in the U.S., for example, to avoid litigation from Apple and others. However, Lin says it has more to do with the fact that carriers still subsidize a lot of the devices sold in the U.S. That make customers less likely to appreciate the value that Xiaomi can deliver, Lin said.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, the connected home is the next big frontier for Xiaomi. The company has a $3 module that device makers can use to turn their existing appliances into smart ones, and Xiaomi is also aggressively looking to invest in an partner with smart-home players. It has already invested in Misfit, among other companies. It also wants all of the smart devices to be controlled from a single Mi Home app.\n\n3. Xiaomi has come to praise Google, not bury it.\n\n\"We are a very strong supporter of Google,\" Barra said during the event, adding that contrary to popular believe, Xiaomi isn't looking to fork Google's Android platform at all. He said that what it has done with its operating system is similar to the customization attempted by other handset makers. He said the main difference is just the success it has had in adding features customers want. At the same time, he hastened to add that Xiaomi has been among the quickest handset makers to upgrade to new versions of Android. The current MiUI 6 is based on Kit Kat, with a Lollipop version in the works.\n\n4. Xiaomi updates its software quickly -- like really quickly.\n\nThe company updates its software every Friday, based in part on reaction from its customers. It spends Monday through Wednesday coding the incremental updates, tests them internally on Thursday and releases them on Friday. Saturday and Sunday are spent examining the real-world feedback and planning for the following week. The company has done so for the past 224 weeks and counting.\n\n5. Xiaomi has a very, very active community.\n\nThe company has 40 million active users on its forums. Yesterday, there were 169,000 posts -- and that was a slow day. Some days there are 500,000 new posts to its Chinese forums.\n\n6. Xiaomi does so care about patents. And it is filing for a lot of its own.\n\nThe company filed for 2,800 patents last year, including in places like the U.S., Japan and Korea. It plans to double its patent applications this year and next.\n\n\"IP litigation is going to be part of any company,\" Lin said. \"This is something we expect happens. We just don't know when.\"", "Most people in the U.S. have never heard of Xiaomi. The five-year-old company is the number five smartphone manufacturer in the world and says it sold 61 million smartphones last year.\n\nNow the Beijing-based company wants people in the U.S. to know all about its tablets, phones, and customized Android operating system, MIUI.\n\nThe only catch is, there are no plans to actually sell these things in the U.S. anytime soon. There is a tangle of IP, patent and carrier issues that Xiaomi would have to overcome to sell mobile devices in the U.S.\n\nInstead, it's launching a limited version of its popular e-commerce store, Mi.com, in the states later this year. It won't sell the phones or tablets, only a selection of smaller branded products like headphones, air purifiers, smart home devices, and the oddly popular Mi Bunnies (plush bunnies wearing adorable outfits), of which it's sold 1.97 million.\n\nRelated: This is the Apple of China\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [iPhones and tables] to market is significant,\" said Xiaomi vice president Hugo Barra, who was previously a vice president at Google (GOOG). \"So we're accelerating our entry, in a sense, by bringing in simpler products.\"\n\nDuring a press event in San Francisco on Thursday, Xiaomi president Lin Bin and Barra went over the company's various hardware products, mobile operating system features and meme-heavy marketing approach in excruciating detail.\n\n\"A lot of their success in China is because they have very tightly integrated and localized features in their operating system,\" said Ben Bajarian, an analyst at Creative Strategies.\n\nIn selfie-loving China, that means the front camera estimates age and gender and applies automatic \"beautification\" filters. There are anti-spam call tools, and pre-written greetings for local holidays and festivals. Notifications are strictly controlled to keep users from being overwhelmed.\n\n\"We curate the hell out of this ecosystem to make sure people have more peaceful lives,\" said Barra.\n\nRelated: Xiaomi's new phone wants to be an iPhone killer\n\nLast year, Xiaomi sold 61 million phones and increased its revenue 135%. It sells mobile devices in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and recently expanded into India. Its MUIU operating system could easily appeal to customers in the United States who fall somewhere in the middle of the Android/iOS spectrum.\n\n\"It's essentially them attempting to test this market,\" said Bajarin.\n\nIn China, Xiaomi relies heavily on social media and a loyal fanbase to do a lot of its marketing. There are regular meet-up events where people perform songs about Xiaomi. Some \"fans\" (the companies preferred euphemism for users) shave the logo into their hair, others Photoshop images of the company's eight founders into famous movie posters.\n\nXiaomi doesn't yet have that kind of enthusiastic, organic user base in the U.S. That's why, at least for now, it's focusing on making more Americans aware of its brand, not winning them over as users.", "American companies have about $2 trillion in overseas accounts -- money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States. But they're reluctant to do so, in part because of the way the U.S. tax system works.\n\nPresident Obama proposed some big changes in the tax code last month that would encourage U.S. companies to bring more money home. A lot of people in Washington agree with the goal. But there's sharp disagreement about how to accomplish it.\n\nLast month, the European Union issued a report about Amazon and the taxes it pays. The online retailer does a lot of business in Europe but its corporate tax rate is in the single digits, says Crawford Spence of the University of Warwick in England.\n\n\"Amazon has big operations in the U.K. but they pay very little tax here, because most of their tax is paid in Luxembourg,\" he says.\n\nAnd it's not alone. Big U.S. companies such as Starbucks and Apple have pared down their tax bill by funneling revenue into tax havens like Luxembourg and Ireland. Spence says it's totally legal.\n\n\"Currently the rules are very complicated, very convoluted, which suits companies very well, cause there are always loopholes,\" he says.\n\nThe rules proposed by Obama last month would change that. The president wants to lower the tax rate on overseas corporate revenue. But a 19 percent minimum tax would kick in if companies use too many loopholes and tax havens, says Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California law school.\n\n\"These kinds of games are exactly the reason why you need the minimum tax,\" he says. \"The minimum tax is the safeguard against these kinds of abuses.\"\n\nAnd the president has proposed something else. Under current law, U.S. companies can make all the money they want overseas and as long as they keep it there never pay a dime of U.S. taxes. That gives them a big incentive to keep profits overseas, and companies such as Apple have huge stashes of money sitting offshore.\n\nUnder the proposal companies would pay a 14 percent tax on that money, regardless of whether they bring it back home. Whether these proposals will go anywhere is unclear. Kleinbard is optimistic.\n\n\"The last serious Republican effort from a year ago had exactly the same concepts,\" he says. \"The numbers were lower, but that's what good faith negotiations are all about.\"\n\nIn other words, the president's proposals represent the kick-off of a lengthy round of bargaining with Congress. So far Republican leaders say they're open to negotiating. But Ken Kies of the Federal Policy Group says many business leaders don't like the White House proposals.\n\n\"A lot of multinationals think they would be put in a worse competitive situation than they are today because at least today they don't pay U.S. tax on that income until they actually bring it back to the United States whereas the president's proposal would impose an immediate 19 percent tax,\" he says.\n\nKies, former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, is skeptical that corporate tax reform can go anywhere in this political climate.\n\n\"It's hard to do tax reform under the best of circumstances and I wouldn't say these are the best of circumstances with a president who's in his last two years in office. It's really hard to do really big things,\" he says.\n\nKies says a lot of people in the business world want to see tax reform because they're tired of the uncertainty surrounding the issue. But they won't go along with it if they end up paying more. And there isn't enough time left to resolve the issues Obama has placed on the table.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online.

Data traffic on Chinese mobile devices jumped almost 50 percent last year but overall usage was modest by global standards, reflecting low consumption in rural areas that hasn't gone unnoticed by telecoms firms.\n\nAverage monthly data usage on all types of mobile devices, including smartphones, topped 200 megabytes (MB) per user for the first time in 2014, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said last week. That's equivalent to downloading 50 songs from the Internet and compares with a global monthly average of 819 MB per smartphone last year, Cisco figures show.\n\nChina Mobile, the country's biggest wireless carrier, is looking to expand its fourth-generation (4G) high-speed coverage in rural China after increasing its 4G subscribers to more than 90 million last year from zero a year earlier. Domestic smartphone makers, such as Coolpad, Lenovo and ZOPO, have rolled out sub-$100 4G handsets while Apple and Samsung Electronics fight for dominance in the premium segment.\n\nChina's three carriers, which includes China Telecom and China Unicom, are expected to market their services aggressively to rural China as online content and services rise and technology becomes more affordable. Immediate obstacles would be coverage and signal reliability.

Cheaper handsets may be key to igniting demand in India. Lenovo has launched a budget 4G smartphone, the A6000, priced at 6,999 rupees ($112). That's cheaper than Xiaomi's Redmi Note 4G.

Barra said it takes \"an incredible amount of work\" to bring more technologically complicated products, such as a smartphone, to a new market. He didn't say when that might happen.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At the San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. They range from games and messaging features to services that let users search for a nearby doctor and make an appointment on their phone.\n\nWhen asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Lin implied that it's not a big factor for the company. But he said, \"all companies have had patent litigation.\" He said Xiaomi has filed for hundreds of patents in part to beef up its own defenses against such claims.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Lin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.", "American companies have about $2 trillion in overseas accounts -- money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States.

Today the team behind Workflow is releasing version 1.1, which adds support for over 5o new actions in addition to including new features and updating some existing actions. Check out the latest from Workflow for iOS below:\n\nAs far as features go, Workflow 1.1 adds a list of new functionality. For instance, Workflow already allows you to drag and drop actions to create tasks on a grid for easily accessing, and the new version adds the ability to double tap a workflow to initiate it even quicker than before.\n\nThe new version also allows you to duplicate workflows so you can edit them to make your own versions without losing the original or having to create your own similar workflow from scratch.\n\nFor workflow discovery, a new section for apps now promotes which apps can interact with each other, and workflows can now be marked as favorites for accessing actions you want to find quickly.\n\nCustomization is also improved with version 1.1 as you can now use photos from your iPhone or iPad to use as icons for the home screen shortcuts Workflow can create for tasks. Workflow 1.1 is more accessibility-friendly now as well with support for Apple's VoiceOver feature. In addition to other features, Workflow 1.1 also promises improvements to \"overall responsiveness, speed, and launch time.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, the latest version of Workflow includes more than 50 new actions for automating tasks. A few examples of these new actions include generating a random number, getting distance between locations from Maps, getting device battery level, changing text case, sharing a photo to WhatsApp, and many more. Rounding out the new version, Workflow 1.1 updates more than a dozen existing actions while fixing a number of significant bugs and fixing some existing actions in the process.", "CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nThe Internet has produced some of history's most innovative, agile and disruptive companies. Goliaths such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix and Facebook -- as well as myriad start-ups -- have overhauled the economy and changed the way people lead their lives and conduct their business.\n\nBut the Internet has long been in danger of being co-opted by its least competitive and innovative part: its service providers.\n\nTo varying degrees these ISPs, such as Verizon and Comcast, have looked at the spectacular success of Silicon Valley and decided that they should get a cut of the action. So it's great news that the Federal Communications Commission, after years of delay, is set to stop this from happening.\n\nIn a column published last week in Wired, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and wireless industries, said he would propose rigorous \"net neutrality\" rules that would restrain his former clients. A vote is set for later this month, and Wheeler's plan appears to have sufficient support to pass.\n\nNet neutrality bars service providers from creating \"fast lanes\" for content companies that pay, or \"slow lanes\" for those that won't. This would prevent an ISP from forcing itself into partnerships with its richer high-tech brethren. It would also keep high-tech companies from using their clout to beat back emerging competitors. The most immediate effect would likely be an end to a deal that Netflix signed with Comcast for faster service.\n\nFor consumers, net neutrality would ensure that the Internet isn't transformed from an open platform into a marketplace where people are steered to content that costs money. It might also mean lower costs, as anything content providers pay to ISPs is likely to be passed on to consumers.\n\nFor years, the FCC tried to impose rules that would have prevented the worst excesses while hoping that the ISPs could become more competitive. But courts kept blocking those rules. The only way around is for the FCC to reclassify ISPs as something akin to public utilities, using its power under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThat's a big step, one that Wheeler, as the swing vote on the commission, has been reluctant to embrace. The move, expected to be challenged in the courts, amounts to regulating ISPs.\n\nBut the plan is a far cry from government \"taking over\" the Internet, as some critics charge. The early Internet, in its dial-up stage, would never have succeeded if not for regulations. AT&T was forced by government to interconnect with non-AT&T networking equipment. And it, as well as its successor \"Baby Bells,\" were forced by government to operate as common carriers, refraining from interfering with the content passing over their wires.\n\nA decade ago, Ed Whitacre, the former head of SBC (now AT&T) said that he was determined to extract revenue from companies like Google that want to \"use my pipes free.\" His successors appear similarly determined.\n\nSometimes, rules on uncompetitive companies are necessary to allow more competitive ones to thrive. It was true in the age of dial-up. And it's still true today.\n\n-- USA TODAY\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://oshko.sh/1DmAedm", "American companies have about $2 trillion in overseas accounts -- money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States.

They feel that the rezoning could \"create housing, which would benefit the many families employed at the new jail.\"\n\nAccording to the Hodges, the property has become economically \"unviable\" as an RV park due to a number of factors. They say there is little demand for RV sites outside the August long weekend, and increased competition is prompting some parks to accept long-term rentals (for financial security) - a practice not permitted at Apple Beach under the current zoning.\n\nBC Assessment has valued the property based on future residential waterfront uses, which exceeds the revenue generated from the current RV business.\n\nIn addition, many of the existing trees on the property require removal for safety reasons.\n\nTown planner Christopher Garrish said a campground is the only permitted use under the current zoning. He noted that council must ask itself whether residential development is appropriate on this property.\n\nGarrish said one objective of the Official Community Plan is to ensure that sufficient land is protected and designated for commercial use.\n\n\"Staff are concerned that there are only nine parcels currently designated tourist commercial within the Town.\"\n\nGarrish said the proposed conversion of the Apple Beach property would reduce commercially designated land adjacent to the lake by 28 per cent, with no clear opportunities for the Town to designate other land adjacent to a large water body.\n\n\"While staff are sympathetic to the applicant's assertions regarding the difficulty of running a campground operation, this is not seen to be a valid land use consideration,\" the planner stated.\n\nHe also noted that converting this site to residential may create expectations that converting the remaining tourist sites adjacent to the lake would similarly be supported.\n\nGarrish said other options are available to the applicant, such as seeking a rezoning to CT2, which allows for a wider range of uses, such as hotels, motels and restaurants. But the Hodges previously stated that financing would not be available for a hotel.\n\nGarrish noted that parcels of land west of Apple Beach have already been designated for future medium density residential, such as townhouses, apartments and cluster housing.\n\nMayor Ron Hovanes said one of the Town's priorities is to review the Official Community Plan, noting there have been some applications involving potential zoning changes.\n\n\"The time is needed to review the process, which will have serious budget implications,\" the mayor said.\n\nCouncillor Jack Bennest said the Apple Beach proposal does need public exposure, which will help the Town make a decision on the application.", "Philadelphia: home to the Liberty Bell and, coming in 2016, the Democratic National Convention.\n\nPhilly beat out both New York City and Columbus, Ohio, to host 2016's DNC.

The others just had too many drawbacks.\n\nLike Philadelphia, Columbus is located in an important battleground state. But at a little more than 820,000 people, it was also the smallest city of the three contenders, leaving questions as to whether it could accommodate the convention's attendees.\n\nThe fact that Republicans tapped Cleveland, Ohio, as the host city of their national convention may have also soured the prospects of Columbus. The city raised $68 million for the spot and promoted its own accommodations and walkability.\n\nOn the flip side, Altman suggests New York's large size also would've presented an accommodation problem, creating a \"logistical nightmare\" in ensuring attendees reached the convention center. (Video via City of New York)\n\nThat, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's strained relations with the city's police may have also contributed to the Big Apple being ruled out. The last thing Democrats would want is another flare up between both sides in the middle of the convention.\n\nSo, picking the right city for a political convention is all about location, accommodation and ease of navigation.

It plans to hew to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nBarra was joined Thursday by Bin Lin, Xiaomi's co-founder and president, at the company's first major press event in the United States.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Barra described the U.S. website as \"an experimental launch\" that will help the company raise awareness in the U.S., which in turn would help its profile in other countries. He said the company also is hoping to get the kind of feedback and ideas from U.S. consumers that the company gathers in China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and six other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The company plans to expand into Brazil later this year. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Lin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.", "Since its introduction in October 2014, Apple Pay has been a popular topic in the payment industry and all over the news. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, more than one million people had registered their credit cards with the service in the first three days. However, a recent report from InfoScout indicates that only 9 percent of iPhone 6 users have actually tried Apple Pay and only 5 percent of the eligible transactions on Black Friday were from Apple Pay users. Balancing between the benefits of accepting Apple Pay versus the costs of new or upgraded point of sale equipment are key considerations when deciding whether accepting Apple Pay is a good move for your business.\n\nApple Pay is a \"digital wallet service\" that allows iPhone users to pay for goods and services, using an iPhone 6, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 (and soon an Apple Watch) via Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC is a form of short-range wireless communication that allows the cardholder to process a transaction at a merchant location by holding their mobile device near the NFC capable terminal. NFC technology is used by most digital wallet solutions.\n\nAccording to an article on Investopedia, Apple Pay vs Google Wallet: How They Work, when a customer registers with the service, Apple contacts the issuing bank directly and receives back a unique Device Account Number (DAN) that is stored on the phone's secure chip. This DAN solution is called tokenization. The DAN serves as a proxy for the customer's actual credit card number and is used in the sale transaction making Apple Pay potentially more secure than a traditional credit card for consumers. Because Apple Pay acts only as a payment medium, they do not track consumer purchases on their systems, potentially providing more privacy than other digital wallets.\n\nApple's DAN approach allows for added security and peace of mind for consumers, but it also means that Apple must sign-up issuing banks to work with their system, whereas Google Wallet is designed to work with every issuing bank and credit card provider. This may prove to be a hurdle for Apple.\n\nApple Pay simply offers another way for retailers to capture a sale. The novelty of the technology and simple ease of use could encourage customers to use Apple Pay. For customers whose phones are perma-glued to their hands, Apple Pay is an obvious next step. According to a recent New York Times article, Dozens More Companies Sign Up for Apple Pay, many major retailers like Disney, McDonalds and Uber -- as well as credit card issuers that make up 90 percent of all credit purchases -- have embraced Apple Pay as an additional way to accept payment and many more are expected to join in the coming years. This could make Apple Pay a preferred payment method for consumers in coming years.\n\nFor businesses, however, the immediate incentives for adding Apple Pay are small. According to an article on Forbes, Why You're Not Using Apple Pay, the credit card fees are still incurred the same as with traditional credit cards. Furthermore, businesses need to have point of sale equipment that supports NFC. This is an added cost that many smaller businesses are finding it hard to justify to simply support Apple Pay. However with smart card technology (EMV) coming in 2015, many retailers need to upgrade their point of sale equipment and this will drive the migration to NFC supported equipment, potentially paving the way for Apple Pay and other digital wallets.\n\nEven though Apple and credit card companies could see significant benefits with Apple Pay, they are offering surprisingly little incentive to retailers. In fact, 31 percent of customers on Black Friday claimed that they didn't even know if a particular store accepted Apple Pay. Apple Pay is designed to seamlessly speed up the checkout process for both retailers and customers, but because of its newness in the market, most retailers are not yet equipped to deliver on this promise.\n\nUptake of Apple Pay across all retailers will be slow so there's no immediate need to buy Apple Pay compatible terminals right now. However as businesses consider replacing older point of sale equipment, be sure the new equipment is NFC-ready (contactless-ready). NFC-ready systems will enable you to accept a broader range of payments from customers, including Apple Pay, and other digital wallets. Be cautious to not overpay for NFC-ready solutions. Most new terminals are equipped with NFC capability and the costs for these terminals are in the range of about $300. As for point of sale card readers that are EMV/smart card ready, as well as support NFC and Apple Pay, the costs can vary greatly depending on the point of sale system being used at the business.\n\nThe success of Apple Pay will depend on the willingness of issuing banks to partner with Apple, and even more so the consumer's willingness to adopt the payment technology. If more retailers and customers start accepting Apple Pay as a preferred payment method, the need to integrate Apple Pay into your current point of sale systems may become more important. However there seems to be little urgency to upgrade point of sale equipment immediately to support Apple Pay.", "American companies have about $2 trillion in overseas accounts -- money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States.

While this helped protect backups, photos, and other personal data stored using Apple's cloud service, it didn't extend to some other commonly used Apple services. According to a Guardian report, Apple is turning on 2FA for the iMessage and FaceTime services starting today.\n\nIf you've already enabled 2FA on your iCloud account, there's nothing else to do -- signing into iMessage or FaceTime on a new device will now prompt you to generate an app-specific password on the AppleID management page. If you're unfamiliar, app-specific passwords are randomly generated passwords separate from your main account password that you typically use once to grant access to a specific app, and you can only generate these passwords using a device that has already been verified with your account. Once you've generated a password, you'll enter that into the password field along with your AppleID to sign in.\n\nThe experience isn't as good as it could be. Tap the \"create\" button on an iPhone, for example, and you'll be directed to the desktop version of a sign-in page to generate your password; ideally, Apple will come up with something a bit more mobile-friendly in the future. Several Apple services still aren't protected by two-factor authentication -- you can sign in to iTunes, the App Store, or the online Apple Store without needing anything other than your account password -- but it makes sense for Apple to focus first on services that are more likely to expose sensitive data.", "The Kentucky Route Zero season pass is 50% off today.

That promise doesn't mean much -- and won't keep you on the program -- if you don't really trust the guys behind it.\n\nBut I do. I've been talking pretty much constantly with Jonathan Lee, the Marketing Director at TrainerRoad. You wouldn't think a marketing guy would be deeply knowledgeable about training and racing, but Jonathan's an outrageously strong rider (his racing objective for this year is to win the XC Cat 1 National Title) and total physiology geek.\n\nAnd he's nice, too. And smart. And as obsessed with training right as I've ever seen a person be.\n\nAnd then there's Chad Timmerman, Head Coach for TrainerRoad. He's a Level 1 USA Cycling Coach and a Cat 1 Dirt / Cat 2 Road racer.\n\nThese guys know what they're talking about. I've been learning a lot from them.\n\nCome Talk With Us\n\nSo I've asked them to share the love with my friends. Meaning you.\n\nMeaning, I'm going to do a webinar chat with them, and you should totally join us. Here's the info you need:\n\nThe Big Surprise\n\nThis next bit is going to come off as a little bit commercial-y. But it's not. It's actually how I feel. Because initially, both the Hammer and I expected to tolerate TrainerRoad. To put up with it. To, basically, survive it.\n\nWe actually love the intelligent intensity and variety and automatic simplicity of TrainerRoad workouts. We love the way we have a plan that takes into account how much time we have for exercising (and that this amount sometimes changes), and how we're given varying workouts that build us up and make us stronger, little by little.\n\nWe love how the workouts are super-easy to download, and then -- thanks to the way the TrainerRoad software talks to our phones or computers, which talk to the Wahoo Kickr -- get the right amount of resistance for the effort we're supposed to be putting out.\n\nWhich means that all the Hammer and I have to do is show up, follow instructions, and do the work.\n\nIn exchange for which we're promised we'll get stronger and faster.\n\nAnd you know what? It feels like it's working. These guys are really pretty amazing at building plans, at building you up, at a reasonable pace.\n\nThe Problems\n\nThis is not to say that everything's working exactly perfectly with the setup we have. There are some equipment issues that can be pretty frustrating.\n\nThe top issue is bluetooth flakiness. Specifically, if I were starting over, I would not use a Mac Mini as the machine to capture the bluetooth signal from six different devices (two cadence sensors, two heart rate monitors, two Wahoo Kickrs). It's really really uncommon for everything to pair on the first try. And uncommon enough for everything to pair at all that we've kind of given up running two instances of the Mac version of TrainnerRoad, and instead run mine on the Mac, and The Hammer's on her phone.\n\nI've talked with TrainerRoad about this frustration, and they say that Apple, when it released the Yosemite version of their OS, changed bluetooth interaction. They're working on working around it, but it's still kind of clunky.\n\nThe workaround would be to get ANT+ USB dongles for the computer, using them instead of bluetooth to read data. This is what we're going to try next, because it really is awesome to be watching Netflix and be able to see your workout profile and stats and get audio cues and video and video instructions.\n\nThe next gap in TrainerRoad is it is really just about the training part of getting faster. And as I have learned through years and years of sad experience, you can't out-exercise a bad diet.\n\nSo in spite of the fact that I feel like I'm pretty darned strong for mid-February, I have a bunch of weight to lose...and I've still got a lot of work to do that (today's weight: 168.8). I'd really love it if TrainerRoad had a diet plan as thorough and well thought-out as its workout plans. Better yet, integrated with its workout plans.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only guy who's wished for this, and I expect it's something TrainerRoad has considered. So if you're reading this, TrainerRoad guys, consider this my vote for a really useful upsell. I'd be all-in.\n\nSo, yeah, room to grow, room to improve. But here's the thing I'm wanting to drive home here: I'm a full-on convert. And so is The Hammer. This is the first winter we've ever looked forward to our indoor trainer workouts...and I'm saying this months into winter, so this isn't just a \"new owner pride\" kind of thing.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.", "Apple has started to reject mobile games from the iOS app store for displaying guns in their promotional material and app store icons. So far, the regulation hasn't had an impact on actual in-game content.\n\nFirst reported by Pocket Gamer, mobile developers began receiving rejections from Apple on \"iTunes Connect,\" the portal through which the company provides feedback on app store games, in late January. The change was sudden enough that developer Orangepixel, which had released its mobile game Gunslugs II on January 16th, first learned about the new policy when it tried to release an update for the game roughly two weeks later, Orangepixel's Pascal Bestebroer told Kotaku in an email.\n\n\"[The] rejection was only about one screenshot,\" Bestebroer said. The image had been approved by Apple previously for the game's original release. \"The update was rejected by Apple because of the 'violence' in the screenshots (side note: Gunslugs 2 uses pixel-art, tiny 12x12 main characters and 1x1 blood pixels).\"\n\nBestebroer said that the impression he got from Apple was that the company was that the promotional material for Gunslugs II had to be appropriate for a \"4+\" age rating:\n\nThe idea behind it, from what I understand, is that even tho the app has a 12+ rating, they do need icons and screenshots and basically the store-page to be 4+ rated. So screenshots should not show anything that is below the 12+ rating.. which is a bit hard to do for most action games.\n\nApple therefore appears to be cracking down on any and all images of guns, regardless of how realistic or violent those firearms may be.\n\nOrangepixel didn't end up changing the offending material, choosing instead to push back on Apple's decision.\n\n\"I tried discussing it with them,\" Bestebroer said, \"explaining that if I search for 'zombie' or 'call of duty' on the app-store I get a lot more violent images then mine...finally I posted about it on my blog.\"\n\nThe blog post, titled \"Apples rejection freaks me out,\" brought more attention to the issue. After that, Bestebroer said, \"the game was approved within an hour or two.\" He's also released another update since then, which \"got approved without problems.\" Other developers haven't had the same success pushing back against Apple, however. Since the regulation only applies to promotional material rather than actual in-game stuff, it's much easier for developers to change the icons or screenshots for their game than appeal Apple's rejection -- a process that could preclude a game from receiving valuable updates.\n\nIt's not clear how wide-ranging Apple's new regulation is, or how many mobile game developers have been affected by it. Pocket Gamer's story identifies four developers who've received rejections from Apple. When asked, a game developer confirmed this story for Kotaku but later asked us not to publish what they had said.\n\nI reached out to Apple for comment on this story, and will update it once I hear back.\n\nIf you're a mobile developer who's been affected by Apple's new regulations or have any other useful information, you can reach me at yannick.lejacq@kotaku.com or find me on Twitter at @YannickLeJacq.", "American companies have about $2 trillion in overseas accounts -- money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States.

Whether these proposals will go anywhere is unclear. Kleinbard is optimistic.\n\n\"The last serious Republican effort from a year ago had exactly the same concepts,\" he says. \"The numbers were lower, but that's what good faith negotiations are all about.\"\n\nIn other words, the president's proposals represent the kick-off of a lengthy round of bargaining with Congress. So far Republican leaders say they're open to negotiating. But Ken Kies of the Federal Policy Group says many business leaders don't like the White House proposals.\n\n\"A lot of multinationals think they would be put in a worse competitive situation than they are today because at least today they don't pay U.S. tax on that income until they actually bring it back to the United States whereas the president's proposal would impose an immediate 19 percent tax,\" he says.\n\nKies, former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, is skeptical that corporate tax reform can go anywhere in this political climate.\n\n\"It's hard to do tax reform under the best of circumstances and I wouldn't say these are the best of circumstances with a president who's in his last two years in office. It's really hard to do really big things,\" he says.\n\nKies says a lot of people in the business world want to see tax reform because they're tired of the uncertainty surrounding the issue. But they won't go along with it if they end up paying more. And there isn't enough time left to resolve the issues Obama has placed on the table.", "Philadelphia: home to the Liberty Bell and, coming in 2016, the Democratic National Convention.\n\nPhilly beat out both New York City and Columbus, Ohio, to host 2016's DNC. But what makes the City of Brotherly Love so special?\n\nTurns out there's a lot that goes into picking the city that'll show off your party's presidential hopeful.\n\nHere's how the DNC's chairwoman explained the choice in a press release, \"Philadelphia's deep-rooted place in American history provides a perfect setting for this special gathering.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia billed itself as historic, easy-to-get-around and successful with previous conventions. The city also said it's located in a well-established swing state during presidential elections. (Video via City of Philadelphia)\n\nIt's the combination of location, size and infrastructure that \"Time\"'s Alex Altman says helped Philly lock in its place as the DNC host city. The others just had too many drawbacks.\n\nLike Philadelphia, Columbus is located in an important battleground state. But at a little more than 820,000 people, it was also the smallest city of the three contenders, leaving questions as to whether it could accommodate the convention's attendees.\n\nThe fact that Republicans tapped Cleveland, Ohio, as the host city of their national convention may have also soured the prospects of Columbus. The city raised $68 million for the spot and promoted its own accommodations and walkability.\n\nOn the flip side, Altman suggests New York's large size also would've presented an accommodation problem, creating a \"logistical nightmare\" in ensuring attendees reached the convention center. (Video via City of New York)\n\nThat, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's strained relations with the city's police may have also contributed to the Big Apple being ruled out. The last thing Democrats would want is another flare up between both sides in the middle of the convention.\n\nSo, picking the right city for a political convention is all about location, accommodation and ease of navigation. And, of course, avoiding bad press."], "2015-02-13": ["Apple shares are up 15 percent in the year to date.

In its latest version, dubbed Lollipop, which has just started to roll out to older phones and tablets, the look and feel of Android and its primary apps get a major overhaul.\n\nGoogle calls the new look in Android 5.0 \"Material Design.\" It's marked by brighter colors, a \"flatter\" but layered look to applications and icons, and greater emphasis on clear and legible text.\n\nThe new design borrows ideas from the flat look that Apple introduced to its mobile operating system in iOS 7 and the interface Microsoft designed for its Windows Phone software. Android remains distinct from both, but it now appears to be in the same family.\n\nFor example, when you turn on Lollipop's new \"battery saver\" mode, the notification bar at the top of the screen and the taskbar at bottom turn a bright orange. The look is reminiscent of how the notification bar turns green in iOS when you are on a call or blue when you turn on its personal hotspot feature.\n\nSimilarly, many of the Google-designed apps in Lollipop have a unique color in their menu bars that serves to distinguish them from other apps. While Gmail's accent color is red, the one for the contacts app is blue.\n\nThe net result is an operating system that feels less like something designed by engineers for engineers and more like something that is lively, fun and accessible to non-techies.\n\nGoogle made some other design changes in Lollipop. One is to how Android displays open applications when you want to switch between them. In previous versions, when you pressed the \"overview\" button to see which applications you had running, Android would display a vertical list of thumbnail images of those programs. With Lollipop, Android displays them like a carousel, with the app windows stacked one on top of another. I prefer the new look, because it allows you to see more of the open apps at once.\n\nGoogle has also revamped the quick settings feature in Android. It's still available in the notifications area, but it's now accessible by swiping down twice from the top of the screen. It also includes some new settings, such as the ability to turn on a smartphone's hotspot feature or to turn on a device's flash to use it as a flashlight.\n\nTo be sure, Google did more in Lollipop than revamp Android's look. The updated software also includes lots of new features.\n\nAmong them are a greater amount of options and controls for notifications. Android users can now respond to alerts that display on their lock screen. They can turn on a privacy feature that allows notifications to be displayed on the lock screen, but blocks their content, such as the actual message in a text message. And they can turn on a mode that will only display alerts from particular people and apps.\n\nOne of the cool new features of Android is that it gives users more options in how to share their devices with others.\n\nAndroid tablets have been able to support multiple user accounts for a while now. With Lollipop, Android smartphones gain the same ability, allowing consumers to access their own contacts and other data on a friend or family member's phone. Lollipop also adds allows users to create guest accounts on both smartphones and tablets that can access any apps but none of the personal data on them.\n\nOf note for parents, the new software has a related feature that allows users to \"pin\" a particular app to the screen so that a child, say, can't use any other apps or see anything else on the device. That might be helpful if your kid wants to play a game on your phone, but you don't want them to see your email or reconfigure your homescreen.\n\nThese types of features -- support for multiple users and the ability to easily restrict access to younger users -- are ones that I've long wished Apple would build into iOS.\n\nGoogle has also enhanced the security in Android. In Lollipop, encryption is turned on by default; previously, it was hard to know that you could use it to protect your data, because to turn it on, you had to find it deep within the system's settings. While Android's ability for apps to work together fairly seamlessly was a selling point over iOS until recently, it's also been a vulnerability, potentially allowing malware to gain access to important functions on the device.\n\nIn Lollipop, Google limits the access particular programs have to the underlying functions; your apps should still be able to work together, but they should pose a lot less of a threat to functioning of your phone.\n\nAs with any new version of Android, the big questions for users are when they will be able to get the new software and the degree to which phone manufacturers will customize it. Although Lollipop has started to become available to certain Android devices, there are lots that still can't get it. When I tried several days ago to download it to two Android smartphones I've been testing -- Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge and Sharp's Aquos Crystal -- it wasn't available.\n\nMeanwhile, few electronics manufacturers offer an unadulterated Android experience. Unless you have one of Google's Nexus devices, you may not see many of the cool new interface features in Lollipop.\n\nOverall, Lollipop is a sweet new update. With both good looks and cool features, it's well worth downloading if you can get it.", "PALO ALTO, Calif.

But an iOS flavor of the ubiquitous mail, calendar, and contact app seemed inevitable.\n\nAfter all, a Mac variation of Outlook has been available for years (alongside the original Windows version), and saw a big update in October (see \"Microsoft Outlook 15.3 for Mac,\" 2 November 2014). What's more, Microsoft in December snapped up tech startup Acompli, which had developed a mobile app for email, scheduling, contact management, and more.\n\nSure enough, Microsoft last month released upgraded iOS and Android versions of the Acompli app, but with a familiar name: Outlook. Both are free.\n\nThe new Outlook is being positioned as a no-brainer for those already invested in Office-type productivity, and as a highly integrated messaging, scheduling, and contact-management hub for those who don't want to juggle individual apps.\n\nMulti-service compatibility is another Outlook draw. It works with Google, Yahoo, and iCloud, along with Microsoft's Exchange ActiveSync and Outlook.com (but not generic IMAP accounts). Cloud-storage services Box, Dropbox, Google Drive and, of course, Microsoft's OneDrive are also along for the ride.\n\nIn a holdover from the Acompli period, Outlook has a streamlined interface with Mail, Calendar, Files, and People buttons (plus Settings) along the bottom for easily switching from mode to mode.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple's Mail, Calendar, and Contacts apps collectively do most of what Outlook does - and support one service, AOL, that Outlook doesn't - but there is something to be said for having all your information in one place. That has long been a Microsoft bragging point.\n\nMail -- Once a user's various email accounts have been set up, they're accessible in Outlook's Mail view via a menu that swoops in from the screen's left edge. That menu offers single-tap access to the inbox for each account, as well as a consolidated inbox, and account subfolders are available with another tap or two.\n\nMail can be filtered in a number of ways. Most notably, messages can be displayed in Focused and Other views, with the former option showing only important missives. Outlook had an initially flawed grasp of what that meant for me - spam made the cut in certain cases, alongside messages from my mother and my best friend - but the app learns over time. Separately, a Quick Filter menu narrows options to unread email, flagged emails, or messages with file attachments.\n\nOutlook has familiar Mailbox-style swiping gestures, which can be customized. By default, the app archives a message with a leftward swipe, and prompts to schedule a message to return to your inbox later with a rightward swipe. Either gesture can be reassigned to delete, move, flag or mark as read/unread. Pressing and holding a message listing opens a bulk-editing mode for selecting multiple messages.\n\nOne note about Gmail accounts: all such Google mail accounts worked properly when set up via IMAP in Outlook. Gmail accounts that are part of the paid Google Apps for Work service also support Exchange ActiveSync, but I couldn't set up my Google Apps account that way in Outlook even though I can do so in Apple Mail. I'm still trying to figure out why.\n\nYou can choose which account to send email from, and you can set a per-account signature, but for those who forward mail into Gmail, for instance, you cannot set an arbitrary return address.\n\nThat points out the most notable account-setup limitation: Outlook for iOS lacks an \"Other email\" option for generic IMAP accounts, which is odd since Outlook for Android does offer such a menu choice (with IMAP configuration options). Hopefully Microsoft will add this to the iOS version soon.\n\nCalendar -- As with email, Outlook consolidates calendars from various services, including Google, iCloud, and Yahoo, along with Outlook.com and Exchange ActiveSync.\n\nThe calendar function is otherwise predictable, with an agenda view, a week view, and a combination day and month view (tap the name of the month). Events can be assigned reminders, and setting up a meeting is simple enough. Calendar colors are customizable.\n\nNotably absent from the calendar lineup are Facebook events, which can be accessed using Apple's Calendar app, along with third-party apps like the Sunrise Calendar app (my default). In a related twist, Microsoft earlier this month acquired Sunrise, so Outlook might get a Facebook event infusion before long.\n\nFiles -- This Outlook view got my attention because hunting down files attached to email messages can be a pain. Now such files are shown in their own tidy lists corresponding to each mail service, along with file-storage services Box, Dropbox, and OneDrive. When I configured my Google account, Outlook also added my Google Drive.\n\nListed documents can't be edited within Outlook, but Microsoft gives each mail account the option of attaching files to outgoing messages, sharing them via whatever services the user has configured for that purpose, or saving them to any of the file-storage accounts. Files already in Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive can be shared out or sent as attachments.\n\nFile management is one area Outlook shines in comparison to Apple Mail, which has no file-only view, and doesn't let you attach files from, or save files to, the likes of Box and Dropbox. I suspect many people will jump to Outlook for this reason alone.\n\nPeople -- Outlook's integrated approach carries over to the app's People view, which lists contacts from each service in its own tidy list, or in a consolidated multi-service view. It's easy to compose a new message to a person by tapping the pencil button next to that person's name.\n\nTap a person's name and Outlook shows pending meetings and recent file attachments associated with that person, along with recent messages (covering about the last four days). It would be nice if Outlook could expand the scope of the email search, but there's apparently no way to do that.\n\nBottom Line -- In the iOS realm, Outlook has entered a crowded field with dozens of mail and calendar apps jockeying with Apple's stock apps for user loyalty.\n\nBut Outlook stands out because it consolidates functions from a number of different apps into a single, simple-to-navigate interface, and because it assembles a variety of email and cloud storage services into an integrated information hub. Its file management features are another big plus.\n\nAs a result, Outlook seems destined to carve out a major slice of the iOS market on the strength of its name and undeniably useful features. It's free and easy to test, so if its features sound attractive, give it a try.", "Today: As cybersecurity hits the spotlight with President Barack Obama's push, Silicon Valley companies that focus on the issue could benefit from a boost in spending and Wall Street's desire to bet on it.\n\nThe Lead: Silicon Valley security stocks may benefit from push\n\nCybersecurity firms are capturing renewed attention from investors as President Barack Obama pushes data protection to prevent more hacks like the one that struck health care provider Anthem.\n\n\"The government's really overdue for a surge in spending, and I think this could be the catalyst,\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said Friday, adding, \"I view this as a once-in-a-multi-decade secular opportunity in terms of cybersecurity.\"\n\nIves' group predicts that spending on cybersecurity will jump 20 percent in 2015, a larger leap than most estimates, though all analyses show strong growth in corporate spending on security. Gartner said in August that it expected security spending to grow 8.2 percent to $76.9 billion this year, with spending on data protection jumping 18.9 percent, and a ComputerWorld survey late last year showed roughly half of IT executives expect to increase the money they spend on security in 2015.\n\nThat growth could boost the value of a host of next-generation security specialists that have gone public in Silicon Valley during the past few years, and may prompt larger tech players looking to get a bigger slice of the security pie through acquisitions.\n\n\"In particular, it really helps Palo Alto Networks, FireEye, as well as to a lesser degree Symantec, given where they play on the government side,\" Ives said.\n\nThose three companies are the most valuable Silicon Valley security companies on Wall Street, and leaders from all three joined Obama's cybersecurity summit at Stanford University on Friday.\n\n\"We need to continue to work together across the public and private sectors to give consumers confidence that American cybersecurity is the best in the world,\" Jeff Zients of the National Economic Council said at Friday's event.\n\nFireEye in particular has been in the spotlight of late, as it has been called in to help investigate the attack on health care provider Anthem just as it was for Target and other high-profile hacks.\n\nCEO David DeWalt, who led security firm McAfee into its acquisition by Intel, said this week that companies that are hacked usually call authorities, 'and the second call is to us, or vice versa.\"\n\nFireEye's value plummeted in 2014 as investors worried about the company's spending amid acquisitions and a huge stock sale that followed its initial public offering. The tide seems to have turned of late, though, with the Milpitas security firm gaining 22.5 percent since the Anthem hack, helped by its earnings report.\n\n\"Investors are clamoring for cybersecurity stocks, and FireEye -- as long as they continue to execute -- could be in a sweetspot for 2015,\" Ives said.\n\nPalo Alto Networks -- which went public a little more than a year ahead of FireEye -- has a much larger valuation on Wall Street than FireEye: About $11 billion, second among security companies only to Symantec, which will see its $18 billion market cap cut when the Mountain View company splits in half.\n\n\"Palo Alto Networks has done a better job balancing growth and profitability\" than FireEye, Ives noted.\n\nSmaller security firms could be acquisition targets. Hewlett-Packard announced the acquisition of Cupertino's Voltage Security earlier this week, and other large enterprise-focused companies could be joining suit soon.\n\n\"There's a finite group of high-growth cybersecurity companies and a lot of the larger tech players are going to need more cybersecurity teams in their product portfolio as this convergence in the data center starts to evolve,\" Ives said in a telephone interview Friday. He mentioned Oracle, Microsoft, EMC and IBM as potential shoppers.\n\nSilicon Valley's smaller security companies include Fortinet, which has a market cap of about $5.5 billion; data-center security specialist Imperva, secure-storage firm Barracuda Networks and Proofpoint, all of which have valuations of about $2 billion or less.\n\nSV150 market report: Another record despite Zynga plunge\n\nStocks completed a strong week of gains Friday, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500 to an all-time high, with Silicon Valley tech stocks contributing to the rise despite a big loss for Zynga.\n\nZynga was far and away the biggest loser in the SV150 on Friday, dropping 15.8 percent to $2.24 after falling to a new low of $2.20 in regular trading. The dive arrived after the San Francisco gaming company announced earnings Thursday that showed a continued decline in users and announced more layoffs, this time the closing of Zynga's China studio. Zynga's failure to find its footing led BTIG Research analyst Rich Greenfield to call for a change at the top, calling for the replacement of CEO Don Mattrick, who was put in charge of Zynga less than two years ago. In a blog post, Greenfield listed a series of tough questions he would have asked Zynga's leader if the company allowed questions in Thursday's conference all, including, \"You are not new to the gaming world, why would you rush game launches and not perform adequate testing, particularly as this issue has plagued Zynga for several years running?\"\n\nApple rose to yet more record highs, closing with a 0.5 percent advance at $127.08 as CEO Tim Cook talked security and Apple Pay at President Obama's summit and UBS predicted the Cupertino company could soon be worth $1 billion. Yahoo gained 1.1 percent to $44.42 amid a round of layoffs that cost less than 50 jobs in Silicon Valley and seemed to focus on its Canadian offshoot. Netflix increased 2.1 percent while plotting a course to $5 billion in programming spending, according to one analyst.\n\nUp: Splunk, eBay, Pandora, Salesforce, Adobe, Netflix\n\nDown: Zynga, Facebook, Yelp\n\nThe SV150 index of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies: Up 11.1, or 0.64 percent, to 1,759.48\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index: Up 36.22, or 0.75 percent, to 4,893.84\n\nThe blue chip Dow Jones industrial average: Up 46.97, or 0.26 percent, to 18,019.35\n\nAnd the widely watched Standard & Poor's 500 index: Up 8.51, or 0.41 percent, to 2,096.99", "PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Declaring that the Internet has become the \"Wild Wild West\" with consumers and industries as top targets, President Obama on Friday called for a new era of cooperation between the government and the private sector to defeat a range of fast-evolving online threats.\n\nMr. Obama signed an executive order urging companies to join information-sharing hubs to exchange data on online threats -- and, in some cases, to receive classified information from the government. But the order stopped short of exempting the companies from liability if the data they collected and shared led to legal action.\n\nOnly legislation, which Mr. Obama has tried and failed to get through Congress for three years, can exempt the companies from such liability. Many companies outside the financial industry have been reluctant to share data without such a law in place.\n\nMr. Obama deliberately chose Stanford University as the site of its first summit meeting on online security and consumer protection, saying that it was where much of the Internet was born and is also where the innovations to secure it must be developed.\n\n\"The very technologies that can empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and do great harm,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nMr. Obama also made clear that his six years of presidency have given him new appreciation of how the government will be called upon to protect citizens against the most severe attacks, and once again accused North Korea of hacking into Sony Pictures. \"The cyberworld is the Wild Wild West -- to some degree we're asked to be the sheriff,\" he said. \"When something like Sony happens, people want to know what the government can do about this.\"\n\nMr. Obama arrived in the heart of Silicon Valley at a time of great tension with companies here, including Apple and Google, both represented at the event. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was seated to Mr. Obama's left Friday afternoon at a closed-door lunch meeting with senior executives, only months after coming into direct conflict with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence agencies over the full encryption of its mobile devices. Mr. Obama's intelligence and law enforcement aides would like to preserve access to all digital communication with a court order. The companies say that would create a breach that China and Russia, among others, would exploit.\n\nMr. Cook, who was invited to the meeting to discuss Apple's new payment system, Apple Pay, used the occasion to urge government and technology leaders to do everything they can to protect users' rights to privacy and security.\n\n\"People have entrusted us with their most personal and precious information,\" Mr. Cook said. \"We owe them nothing less than the best protections that we can possibly provide.\"\n\nFailing to do so, Mr. Cook said, would \"risk our way of life.\"\n\nThe private sector has largely been reluctant to share information about threats with the government, arguing that it would create onerous regulations and potentially compromise proprietary and customer data.\n\nJoseph M. Demarest Jr., assistant director of the F.B.I.'s cyberdivision, said in an interview that given the sophistication of the hackers American companies are up against, information-sharing had proved critical to tracing attacks back to hackers and ridding them from systems.\n\n\"We're fighting Ph.D.s on the other side of the world,\" Mr. Demarest said. \"Not only the F.B.I., but our colleagues from the intelligence community, can enable and assist not only with attribution but with kicking actors out and keeping them out.\"\n\nAfter the Sony attacks late last year, Mr. Demarest said the F.B.I.'s presence at Sony's headquarters was crucial in helping the bureau and the government trace the attacks back to North Korea.\n\n\"Companies are realizing there is a benefit to keeping us involved,\" he said.\n\nBusinesses reeling from the fallout from the revelations about online surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden also worry about the impression such sharing would create among customers. Foreign governments are worried that such arrangements will compromise their data.\n\nPrivacy activists say the approach is misguided. \"Key to security is to minimize data collection and adopt robust security measures,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"If they can't protect it, they shouldn't collect it.\"\n\nBut few of those tensions were on display on Friday, as Mr. Obama, government officials and a carefully curated list of executives from the technology, banking, energy and health care sectors took the stage to speak for the need for greater public-private partnership in combating online threats.\n\n\"This work cannot be adversarial; we have enough adversaries out there,\" Anthony Earley Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas & Electric, said on stage Friday.\n\nMany companies point out that they already share information with others in their industries through industry-specific instruments, notably the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a group that shares threats with members of the banking industry.\n\nAnd companies have been particularly reluctant, after the Snowden revelations, to do anything to aggravate concerns abroad that they are sharing data on foreigners with intelligence agencies.\n\nTo assuage those concerns, Bernard Tyson, the chairman of Kaiser Permanente, tried to distinguish the kinds of data his corporation would share with the government.\n\n\"I am not talking about sharing the actual content that I am here to protect,\" Mr. Tyson said. \"It is sharing what I am learning about people trying to get at that content. It's important for me to say that because that is the sensitivity I hear every day.\"\n\nNot mentioned at the event was the issue that has most roiled companies in Silicon Valley. Disclosures by Mr. Snowden showed that intelligence agencies were surreptitiously siphoning off customer data from companies like Google and Yahoo as it flowed internally between their data centers.\n\nThat information created an atmosphere of distrust that executives say will make information-sharing much more difficult.\n\n\"The tricky thing with information-sharing is that it is about trust,\" Eric Grosse, Google's vice president of security, said in an interview earlier this week. \"Information-sharing becomes pretty hard to do once trust is lost.\"\n\nMr. Grosse and others conceded that in extreme situations they would provide critical data to law enforcement, such as an impending problem with an aircraft carrier. \"When it's serious, we will do the right thing.\" But the government, Mr. Grosse said, \"can't cry wolf.\"", "The attackers are becoming more sophisticated and the number of attacks are increasing exponentially, White House senior advisor Valerie Jarret said.\n\nCyberattacks are one of the gravest threats to national security, White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"The attackers are becoming more sophisticated. The number of attacks are increasing exponentially,\" she said in an interview with \" Closing Bell .\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama met with Silicon Valley leaders Friday during a summit on cybersecurity and consumer protection at Stanford University. It was part of his effort to forge a public-private partnership to try the thwart hackers.\n\nAfter speaking at the conference, the president signed an executive order aimed at encouraging companies to share more information about cybersecurity threats.\n\nSome big Silicon Valley companies have been hesitant to fully support more mandated cybersecurity information sharing without reforms to government surveillance practices exposed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nRead More Cyberattacks an 'existential threat to society': VC\n\nWhile some heads of companies didn't attend the conference, instead sending cybersecurity representatives, others, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s Tim Cook and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) President Renee James, were there.\n\nJames was enthusiastic about the partnership.\n\n\"This conversation today just demonstrates the incredible amount of support that we're getting and the open dialogue we're getting between the administration and the CEOs here in the valley,\" she told CNBC.\n\nShe said Intel has already worked on a framework to improve its cybersecurity and is sharing it with other companies. The tech giant has also recently announced a new biometric identification program called True Key, which James said should make it easier to protect passwords.\n\nBoth James and Jarrett agreed that one of the most important things is that companies share data.\n\n\"We have to make sure information is being shared so if there are early alerts that there is a penetration or attack coming that we are sharing that information so that we can get out ahead of it and either avert the attack or try to limit the damage that is done by it and also recover as quickly as we can,\" Jarrett said.\n\nRead More Year of the hack?

He said the new executive order seems more like a federal takeover of private-sector information sharing.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk today about 'public-private partnerships.'

Oh, and yes, it's perfectly OK to give a \"her\" gift to \"him\" and vice-versa, as they're merely suggestions (hey, some women dig drones, too).\n\nFOR HIM\n\nSling fling\n\nStarting at $20 a month, Sling TV delivers more than a dozen live television channels -- like CNN, ESPN, HGTV, TNT and Disney -- which you can access on multiple devices, including iOS and Android phones and tablets, Windows and Macs, Roku products, and Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick. Dish Network's newly launched streaming service will add new stations on a regular basis, including some AMC properties in the coming weeks, but don't expect live programming from major television networks anytime soon (such as ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX). For an extra $5/month, though, Sling TV subscribers can add a Sports Extra Package or a Kids Extra package, each with additional programming.\n\nDroning on and on\n\nNothing says \"I love you\" like a flying drone. Or perhaps that's what your better half might tell you. Controlled with a smartphone app or optional hardware controller, the colorful Bebop Drone from Parrot ($499.99) lets you take to the friendly skies -- and capture the adventures from the 1080p HD fish-eye (180-degree) camera with smooth image stabilization, first-person view piloting (via your smartphone) and 14-megapixel stills. Don't worry about losing your drone on those high-altitude flights, as built-in GPS can return the Bebop to its take-off position, while activating the emergency mode tells the drone to land immediately.\n\nControl freak\n\nWhile a Harmony Remote from Logitech could cost you upwards of $349.99, much of the same functionality is available in the Harmony 350 Control model -- for $49.99. Take control over your entertainment with a simple button layout, color LCD screen and easy Internet-based setup for up to eight of your home theater components; simply program the remote by connecting it to a computer's USB port and logging online to answer a few easy-to-follow questions. The remote also offers \"macro\" commands, therefore you can press an activity-based button, such as Watch a Movie, and the remote does the rest by automatically turning on the applicable components, selecting the correct input and pressing play on your Blu-ray player.\n\nTeam play\n\nWhile you might be creating a \"cyber widow\" by buying a video game for your guy, he'll no doubt want a copy of 2K Games' Evolve ($59.99), a new first-person shooter for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC. Focusing heavily on cooperative (\"co-op\") play, much of the gameplay focuses on four hunters -- you and three online friends, perhaps -- who collectively face-off against a giant beast controlled by a fifth player. Each fighter's individual skills (Trapper, Support, Assault and Medic), the type of monster you're going up against and the environment you're in will all determine how you approach the attack. The more you play, the better the upgrades and perks for your character. This game is rated \"Mature\" by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, therefore ideal for those 17 years of age or older.\n\nFOR HER\n\nBook 'em Danno\n\nIf you're considering a tech gift for a book lover -- and perhaps one who likes to read in the bath or by the pool or beach - the Kobo Aura H2O ($179.99) is billed as the world's first waterproof ebook reader. This 6.8-inch device boasts a non-glare e-ink touchscreen with 265 dots per inch for crisp text and images, and ships with 10 handpicked fonts to suit varying tastes, each of which can be read in 24 font sizes. As the first e-reader with IP67 certification, it's fully waterproof for up to 30 minutes in up to 3 feet (1 meter) of water. Other features include a rechargeable battery that lasts up to two months, a small built-in ComfortLight if you're reading in bed (and don't want to disturb your significant other) and an online store with more than 4 million titles.\n\nMisfit Shine\n\nIf your girl has been eyeing one of those fitness bands, the wearable Misfit Shine ($99.99) is a sleek activity monitor that's designed to be worn virtually anywhere on your body, such as on your wrist, on your belt or as a pendant on a blouse, perhaps. Easily set fitness goals using the free Shine app, and with a simple tap on the device you can see your progress with a halo of bright white LED lights -- whether you're measuring number of steps, distance traveled or burned calories -- or open the app for a deeper dive (including graphs, charts and historical information). Sculpted from aircraft-grade aluminum, this lightweight and water-resistant activity tracker can be worn while walking, running, cycling, swimming or even sleeping. Available colors include black, coral, blue and gray.\n\nSweet dreams\n\nSpeaking of sleep, what if you want to listen to music, an audiobook or podcast when tucking in for the night - -- but don't want to disturb your significant other? Perhaps a Valentine's Day gift like the iMusic Speaker Pillow ($30.99) will be music to her ears. As the name suggests, this pillow embeds a speaker, so you can easily connect to your smartphone, tablet or MP3 player -- via a standard 3.5mm jack -- so you can close your eyes and listen to whatever you like without disturbing anyone else. Ideal for that hard-to-buy-for person, the iMusic Speaker Pillow can also be used while watching a video or playing a game on a portable device while unwinding at the end of the night. Just be sure to flick your phone into Airplane mode to avoid potentially harmful wireless signals and to not be disturbed by notifications while trying to sleep.\n\nSlim is in\n\nMany have tried, but Apple's iPad remains the king of the tablet -- five years running. The iPad mini 3 (from $399) offers a stunning 7.9-inch screen, incredibly intuitive user-interface and, most importantly, a direct link to the App Store and its hundreds of thousands of downloads optimized for iPad. Available in silver, gold and gray, iPad mini 3 features the Touch ID sensor built into the circular home button, which lets you unlock your device or buy products online with your unique fingerprint. Under the hood, this thin tablet is powered by Apple's A7 chip, speedy Wi\u2011Fi performance (and cellular connectivity on some models, from $529) and dual cameras. Of course, you can also choose from thousands of accessories to add even more functionality.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.

(Photo Courtesy of iStock)\n\nPALO ALTO, CA - Between the lawsuits filed this week in the hack of the nation's second largest health insurer, Anthem, Inc., and the White House Cyber Summit at Stanford today, cybersecurity dominated the conversation this week in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe public, however, also is facing concerns about privacy invasions from a source they might never suspect: their own televisions.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. came under fire this week after it was reported that the company's new Smart TVs could \"listen\" to viewers' private conversations.\n\nThe Smart TVs feature a voice recognition system that allows users to give verbal commands to the television, which customers and analysts worry could potentially be used to record private conversations and even share the information with a third party.\n\nThe system, designed for improved \"ease of use\" is activated either by issuing specific commands such as \"change the channel\" or \"increase volume\" into a microphone on the remote control, or by clicking the activation button. Users, however, still worry that the system could pick up sounds other than those intended for the television.\n\nPublic outrage on social media caused Samsung to address the worries directly on the company's blog.\n\nSamsung's policy cautions customers to \"please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.\"\n\nA February 10 post on the company's blog entitled \"Samsung Smart TVs Do Not Monitor Living Room Conversations,\" stated that the voice recognition program could only pick up certain predetermined commands such as \"increase the volume\" or \"change the command.\"\n\nSamsung further attempted to reassure customers that all data was encrypted. The company updated its privacy policy to state that Samsung will only collect interactive voice commands when users make a \"specific search request,\" which may be transmitted to the third-party service provider Nuance Communications, Inc. The company assured customers that their information would only be used to evaluate and improve Voice Recognition features.\n\nThe company's efforts, however, failed to silence critics.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins, for example, tweeted a side-by-side photo comparing Samsung's privacy policy to George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. His remarks have been retweeted more than 20,000 times in fewer than five days.\n\nParker Higgin's tweet has been favorited 9,000 times and retweeted more than 20,000 times since February 8. (Alex Hicks/Peninsula Press)\n\nThe controversy even pushed U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) to question the company's policies. In a letter February 11 letter to North America Chief Executive Officer Gregory, Franken wrote: \"I am concerned that Samsung currently does not provide consumers with the information needed to understand how their voice data may be used by third parties.\"\n\nSen. Franken sent a similar letter on February 10 to LG Corp.'s U.S. President William Cho. LG is one of a number of companies whose smart televisions also feature voice recognition technology. Franken claimed that the company's privacy policy was unclear as to whether they shared data with a third party. The policy urges users to \"\"be aware that if your spoken word includes personal or other sensitive information, such information will be among the Voice Information captured through your use of voice recognition features.\"\n\nLG did not respond to a request for comment. But Samsung representatives say there is no cause for concern.\n\n\"Samsung does not retain voice data or sell it to third parties,\" a Samsung spokesman told ABC News. \"If a consumer consents and uses the voice recognition feature, voice data is provided to a third party during a requested voice command search. At that time, the voice data is sent to a server, which searches for the requested content then returns the desired content to the TV.\"\n\nSome technology analysts back up Samsung's claims. For instance Forbes technology contributor John Archer said in a February 12 article:\n\n\"It's hugely important to stress...that Samsung TVs don't even start listening to you at all unless you fire their listening abilities up by using a keyword or, on some models, pressing a mic button on the control. So they're not constantly sat [sic] there listening to every word you say.\"\n\nStill, in a climate of cybersecurity alert, companies like Samsung will likely have to work to regain customers' trust.\n\n\"I feel a bit annoyed that...it wasn't made clear to me in advance of buying the TV,\" said Smart TV owner Peter Kent in an interview with the BBC. \"It makes me think twice.\"\n\nSpeakers at today's White House Cyber Summit held at Stanford University say they are equally committed to ensuring users' privacy.\n\n\"If we don't do everything we can to protect privacy, we risk more than money,\" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. \"We risk our way of life.\"", "Feb 13 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is hiring automotive technology and design experts to research at a secret lab outside its Cupertino office, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing several people familiar with the iPhone maker.\n\nThe background and seniority of the experts suggest that Apple may be trying to build a car, the financial daily said, citing the sources.

It has purpose, it demands respect. It's... just a car. What the final name will be -- maybe just Apple Car -- when it launches is unclear. Scratch that: it probably won't launch at all.\n\nThe WSJ cautions that Apple's plans for an electric car could change between now and, well, forever.\n\nApple may decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, would be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe report goes on to say that it's common practice at Apple to build multiple prototypes for a project that won't ever go on sale to the public. \"Any product would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications,\" WSJ warns.

We've been hearing Apple is actively poaching folks from companies like Tesla to work on a once in a lifetime opportunity. Project Titan could be it.\n\nOne of the project's largest hurdles is the expense of manufacturing cars. WSJ points out that a single plan can cost well over $1 billion, and requires incredible supply chain resources to produce the components. Apple has proved incredibly adept at controlling the supply chain for electronics, but it would be a completely different ballgame for cars.

It's researching different types of robotics, metals, and materials consistent with manufacturing a vehicle, say sources.\n\nWhile manufacturing a vehicle is typically very expensive, this would not be an issue for Apple who has nearly $180 billion in cash. A single manufacturing plant is said to cost over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce over 10,000 components.\n\nThe WSJ's report corroborates another recent report from the Financial Times that revealed Apple has been hiring experts in vehicle design and automotive technology to work in a secret research lab.\n\nAccording to a source, Apple is not working on a self-driving car to compete with Google; rather, it's looking to build an electric car that will rival Tesla and other car manufacturers.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nHit the link below for more details...\n\nRead More\n\n[Concept]", "Forget UV sensors and heart rate monitors on your gadgets, what about something that can do much, much, more?

Something so simple and private could help save lives.\n\nThe attachment, 10 years in the making, is large and far from svelte, but it can easily pop into an iPhone's headphone jack and analyze a blood sample quickly.

The device made its debut in a new paper published in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe health gadget was created by Columbia Univeristy associate professor of biomedical engineering Samuel Sia and his team, and Sia hopes that it might one day be available for consumers to purchase, especially since the whole set-up costs around $34 to build (plus a small fee, under $2, for the tabs to insert into the device for analysis).\n\n\"If you can start to bring core health services to the smartphone beyond just measuring the heart rate -- like blood tests -- then you're going to start seeing a pretty fundamental shift in the health care system,\" he said.

It would also offer protection from liability for the sharing of cyber threats under certain guidelines.\n\nAlthough the order lacks the liability protection which could be afforded in legislation for information sharing, a White House statement said the measure \"paves the way for new legislation\" by establishing a framework for private-sector information sharing networks. -- AFP", "PALO ALTO, Calif.

Sat on my lap is a recently purchased MacBook Air, replacing an obsolete MacBook that had fallen off Apple's list of supported hardware.\n\nSo why a Mac, and why now? It's the new Microsoft that's encouraged me to add the Air to my stable of test machines, with new tools and services for Mac OS that will only run on the latest OS releases. Then there's needing a machine running Xcode so I can test out the Xamarin cross-platform development tools targetting iOS as well as Windows and Android devices.\n\nWhat's been most interesting about the process has been just how simple it was to set up a new machine; especially one that's not part of the ecosystem I usually use. In the past it's been a process that's been fraught with problems, and with kludgy workarounds. Last time I switched between Mac and PC it was a much more complex process, involving manually moving files from system to system and translating file formats.\n\nSo what makes things different now? It's clear that things have changed dramatically in the last few years, with the rise of cloud services, and especially with cloud sync.\n\nIt doesn't matter what platform you're using; as long as you're able to connect to your cloud sync of choice you can just pick it up and keep working. Yes, there'll always be differences, but the core productivity aspect hinges on the cloud and on sync.\n\nAll I needed to do to get started was to install Microsoft's OneDrive client from the Mac App Store, choose the folders I wanted to sync, and I was ready to start working. While I prefer Word, there was no reason I couldn't use my MacBook Air's bundled copy of Pages to edit my files. However it was just as easy to log on to the Office 365 portal and download the MacOS version of Microsoft Office - and to install the recently updated Outlook client.\n\nIt's interesting how Microsoft's design style has changed since it last launched Office for Mac. Even though the new Outlook (and the similarly designed OneNote) look much the same they do on Windows, iOS, and Android, they're still clearly Mac applications. It's a smart move on Microsoft's part, giving applications a common set of user experiences on all supported platforms, while still supporting the underlying OS's own conventions.\n\nThat new design style also reveals just how outdated Office 2011 feels, when compared with the newer tools. A new Office for Mac is due sometime in the next year, and it's sorely needed, if only to directly integrate with OneDrive and other cloud services like its mobile device siblings. While the OneDrive application handles file sync, it doesn't have the same view of all my recently edited files that I get from Office on the PC, or on iOS, something I've come to rely upon as I switch from device to device.\n\nMy reliance on cloud sync isn't limited to Microsoft tools. Adobe's Creative Cloud lets me bring my Photoshop and Lightroom to my Mac as well as my PC, while apps like Tweetdeck sync their settings with the cloud. It's surprising not to find a cross-platform app that doesn't use some form of cloud sync; even my favourite games use cloud services to synchronise data.\n\nIt's clear this shift to cloud-centric ways of working is why Microsoft has spent much of the last year focusing on its out-ecosystem experience. If it wants to become the one-stop productivity shop, with the potential of a massive recurring Office 365 revenue stream, then it needs to have the tools out there to make its services attractive. That means having good OneDrive clients on MacOS, iOS, and Android, along with clients for the most important parts of the Office suite.\n\nThat's what we're seeing, and while Windows fans may see this as a snub to their platform of choice, it's actually one of the smartest things Microsoft could be doing. Operating systems are, to be honest, a commodity. They come for free with our hardware, and they get updated for free.\n\nWe could just ignore them, as what really matters are the applications we use and the services we connect to. Yes, I could describe myself as a Windows user, but it's now probably more accurate to say I'm an Office 365 and OneDrive user. They've become the backbone of both my work and personal lives, much more than any one computer.\n\nAs things evolve over the next few years, we're going to see this approach to things becoming more and more common. You're going to be a Dropbox user, an iCloud user, a Google Drive user first and foremost. Pick up any device and at least some of your data and apps will be there, as soon as you log in to the computer that really matters: the cloud.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRe-evaluating Steve Ballmer: Satya Nadella isn't the only reason Microsoft is cool againLittle computers, everywhere: Makers and the Internet of ThingsSQL, NoSQL?

The U.S. Apple Association -- which represents the nation's apple industry -- believes they could harm the fruit's wholesome, healthy image. Additionally, The Organic Consumer's Association says the genetic modifications could be harmful to human health, and is calling on food outlets not to use the apples.\n\nDespite push-back, the USDA maintains that Arctic apples are \"not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment.\" The apples are now undergoing a voluntary safety assessment with the Food and Drug Administration.", "PALO ALTO, Calif.

Sure, the new iMac with 5K Retina Display looks a little nicer, but at a steep $2,499 starting point, it's still a luxury, not a necessity.\n\nYet there's something you can do for $200 to $500 that will radically change your iMac's performance: install a solid state drive (SSD) in addition to or instead of its original hard drive. SSDs use high-speed memory chips rather than the spinning platter mechanisms in traditional hard drives, achieving up to 5X benefits in speed while requiring no moving parts. Five years ago, SSDs were both expensive and limited in capacity, making them prohibitively expensive to install in most Macs. Today, high-quality, capacious SSDs can be had for reasonable prices, and they're surprisingly easy to install in iMacs. With limited expertise and only three tools, I swapped out my old hard drive for an SSD in roughly 30 minutes. Here's how I did it, and what I'd recommend for you.\n\niMacs sold between 2009 and mid-2012 have two drive bays: one for the hard drive, and one for the DVD/CD SuperDrive. Some people prefer to keep their old hard drives and replace the optical drive with an SSD. Other people want to keep the optical drive and swap the hard drive for an SSD. It's easier to replace the optical drive, but if you still use DVDs or CDs on occasion, swapping the hard drive is an option. (That's what I did.)\n\nIf you're going to keep your old hard drive inside your iMac, you could save money on the SSD by going with a lower capacity model: 128GB or 256GB could be enough to hold OS X and all of your apps, keeping your music, photos, and videos on the old drive. But if you're going to swap the hard drive for an SSD, you'll probably want a 512GB or 1TB drive, which will have enough breathing room for files that you won't feel constrained over the next few years. I paid a little bit more and went with a 1TB drive, a decision I don't regret at all.\n\nA solid state drive. After a lot of research, I strongly preferred the price, performance, and durability offered by Samsung's 850 EVO, which comes in 1TB ($400, reg. $500), 500GB ($200, reg. $270), 250GB ($100, reg. $150) and 120GB ($75, reg. $100) versions. With write and read speeds in the 500MB/second range, the 850 EVO is super fast, has a five-year warranty, and promises 30% better long-term performance than its already excellent predecessor 840 EVO. There are cheaper SSDs out there, but I value speed and reliability; the 850 EVO has both in spades.\n\nTools. You'll need two grippable suction cups (or one large suction cup, gently applied) T-8 and T-10 Torx screwdrivers, a small Philips head screwdriver, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and some LED screen-safe cleaning spray. You'll probably have at least some of these tools already. This $8 (reg. $13) Delcast Torx set will give you the special Torx drivers you need for this and future projects; a $4 suction cup like this one from WorkShop will be enough for this product. A metal paperclip or tweezers are also handy for pulling the LED display up from the iMac's chassis.\n\nAn in-line digital thermal sensor. If you're going to remove the iMac's hard drive, this roughly $40 cable from OWC/Newer Technology will save you major headaches going forward. Apple hard drives have temperature probes inside; third-party SSDs do not. This cable adds a probe to your SSD, preventing the iMac from panicking and turning on its fans at full blast whenever you turn the computer on. There are software alternatives to this cable, but consider this a small investment that will reduce your need to screw around with manual fan controls while keeping your Mac running perfectly.\n\nA 2.5'' to 3.5'' drive converter bracket. Again, if you're going to remove the iMac's hard drive, you'll need a $10-$15 metal plate to mount the 2.5'' SSD in the iMac's 3.5'' drive bay. Newer Technology sells this $15 one called AdaptaDrive; a less expensive $8 version from StarTech will suffice. Screws are included to mount the SSD on the plate; you'll reuse the iMac's screws to mount the plate inside your computer.\n\nIn all candor, I had no idea how easy or difficult the SSD swap process would be. But if you have the parts mentioned above, it's astonishingly simple.\n\nPreserving Your Software\n\nPreparing your iMac's existing hard drive to be replaced is almost as painless as if you're leaving it untouched inside. You can run a complete Time Machine backup to an external drive (preferably one that's connected with a cable rather than over Wi-Fi), or complicate the process somewhat by using a complete drive cloning app.\n\nIn my opinion, going the Time Machine route is a better idea when starting fresh with an SSD, and it costs nothing. You just turn off and unplug your iMac, swap the drives, then hold Command-R down on the keyboard when first restarting your Mac. Any recent version of OS X will boot into Internet Recovery mode, enabling you to use Disk Utility to format the SSD (choose Mac Extended + Journaled), then restore directly from your Time Machine backup. The restoring process will take hours, but you'll come back to a fresh Yosemite install with everything pretty much as it was left on your old drive.\n\nIf you want to go the more complex route, you can order this $13 (reg. $16) USB 3.0 to 2.5'' SATA III Adapter Cable, connect it to your iMac and SSD before opening up the machine, and run SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to transfer the old drive's contents to the new drive. This will let you start using your iMac right away after the drive is swapped, without waiting hours for Time Machine, and for better or worse pretty much guarantees that every one of your files (and potentially plenty of cruft) will be exactly where it was before.\n\nFor users with plans to swap an optical drive for an SSD, nothing needs to be done to prep software beforehand. Backing up your Mac is always a good idea before opening it up, but all you'll need to do after the SSD installation is run Disk Utility and format the new drive.\n\nHardware\n\nWhile I'll leave the specific iMac opening instructions to the experts at iFixit (this guide works for pre-2012 27'' iMacs), and the details of installing the digital thermal sensor to this video at OWC/Newer Tech, here's a brief play-by-play of my SSD installation experience.\n\n(1) Removing the iMac's glass front was much easier than I expected. If you go gentle when pulling up on a single large suction cup in the upper left or right corner, you can remove the glass face in a matter of seconds, pulling tabs upwards from the iMac's metal chin. Cleaning and reinstalling the glass was so simple that I wish I'd tried it earlier, when dust first began to accumulate between the glass and screen.\n\n(2) Pulling up the iMac's display looks a lot more complicated than it is. Eight Torx screws need to be removed, which is barely challenging at all. You then need to follow the iFixit directions, using a paperclip (or tweezers) against the screen's metal frame to tilt it upwards, then very gently pull four small monitor connectors out from the iMac's various boards. Go slowly and carefully, though you'll soon realize that (with a little dexterity and that modest bit of experience) you'd be able to do all four again in less than two minutes.\n\n(3) Swapping the hard drive out takes little more effort than removing two cables from its back and unscrewing four more Torx screws. An EMI sticker gets pulled off the hard drive and placed on the SSD. Figure out which orientation the SSD needs to be on relative to the 2.5'' to 3.5'' drive converter bracket, then screw the SSD to the bracket with the bracket's included screws. Attach the bracket to the old hard drive's metal rail, such that the SSD's connector pins will eventually face the iMac's small and large hard drive cables.\n\n(4) Following OWC's video, add the in-line digital thermal sensor to the larger hard drive cable in the iMac, connect the sensor's larger connector to the SSD, then use the adhesive backing to attach the sensor to the SSD's large exposed side. Reattach the smaller hard drive cable to the SSD, then use the other Torx screws to attach the bracketed SSD in the iMac. Tuck the thermal sensor's body off to the edge of the SSD.\n\n(5) Go in reverse, reattaching the four display cables, remounting the screen, putting the 8 Torx screws back, and reattaching the glass. Stop long enough to safely clean the screen and the glass with the microfiber cloth and screen-safe cleaning fluid.\n\nIf you're swapping the old hard drive for an SSD, yes, that's it. Rebooting your Mac with an empty SSD requires just holding down command-R on the keyboard, after which you'll see the Internet Recovery prompt and perhaps 15 minutes of automated downloading. If you're booting from a pre-cloned SSD, your Mac will come back as it was before. And if the SSD's in the optical drive bay, your iMac will now have two internal drives to choose from. Make the SSD the boot drive by installing Yosemite on it and choosing it in System Preferences > Startup Disk.\n\nYou'll begin to notice how much faster your iMac is pretty quickly after the installation process is complete. Until and unless there are some major Mac processor performance jumps (and apps worth upgrading for), simply adding an SSD is going to make a much bigger speed difference for most iMac owners than getting a completely new computer with a faster CPU or video card. The machine will resume from sleep instantly, reboot in seconds, and load apps as if they're tiny.\n\nPrices have fallen enough that average users will finally find that SSDs now deliver a great balance of speed and capacity for the dollar. If you're an iMac user, and you want to experience much-improved performance, it's time to make the switch.", "Following a report today that Apple was hiring experts from the automotive industry for a new research lab, The Wall Street Journal adds to the story claiming Apple has several hundred employees working on an Apple-branded electric car:\n\nApple has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. They said the project, code-named \"Titan,\" has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of these people said.\n\nThe report adds that CEO Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago with product design Vice President Steve Zadesky leading the group, lining up with rumors that Apple is working on something that will \"give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nMirroring other recent reports that Apple was poaching experts from the automotive industry, WSJ notes that Zadesky \"was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company.\" Earlier today the Financial Times reported that Apple has hired president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development Johann Jungwirth, along with other auto industry execs, to work at a new, secretive automotive research lab. Apple has also been locked in a poaching war with Tesla, attempting to lure away that company's employees with big bonuses.\n\nAdding to that, the report from the WSJ says the location of the lab is just a few miles from Apple's HQ in Cupertino and currently includes employees working on \"robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing.\"\n\nIn addition to the new hires and research lab, the report claims Apple has met with contract manufacturers that produce high-end vehicles. Several minivans leased to Apple with camera arrays and other equipment have also been spotted in some major cities over the past few months.", "According to Billboard, Apple's upcoming streaming service - the next evolution of Beats Music - could see a \"possible\" launch sometime in the spring, but is \"certain\" to reach consumers by summer. 9to5Mac reported on the revamped Beats-based service last week, putting forward iOS 8.4 as the update that could potentially put the on-demand, premium service into the hands of millions of iPhone users without making them download a standalone app. Apple is expected to integrate Beats' features, curated playlists, and social/sharing functionality directly into the Music app, though 9to5Mac also suggested that development of Apple's new premium music service hasn't been going so smoothly, with one source calling the situation \"a mess.\"\n\nSpotify isn't waiting around for Beats Music 2.0\n\nMeanwhile, Spotify hasn't slowed down. The company's user growth remains solid and it's kept iterating on the listening experience with redesigned mobile apps, improved sharing, and most recently, a clever and instant way of previewing songs. As Apple works to get its latest try at streaming music out the door, Spotify is headed towards an IPO. But the breadth of Apple's reach -- and all those credit cards already tied to iTunes -- can't be overstated. Tim Cook is no doubt eager to nail the formula after mixed, unspectacular results that Apple has seen with iTunes Radio, iTunes Match, and Beats Music.\n\nBillboard's report also hints that Apple shares a goal with Beats Music; kicking \"spam\" tracks out of its ecosystem. Ian Rogers, who was Beats Music's CEO before it was purchased by Apple, told The Verge last year that the company was making a concerted effort to expunge the karaoke versions, re-recorded tracks, and deceptive covers that can clog up music services and make finding the song you really want to hear a chore. Billboard says that a \"major scrub\" of iTunes could be on the way, though Apple sources reportedly told the publication that occasional trimmings of the content catalog are nothing new.", "It seems like just last week the world was lamenting Apple's loss of hundreds of engineers to Tesla, that upstart automaker down the street in Palo Alto. And that's because it was just last week, but now the talk has shifted 180 degrees thanks to a Financial Times report. It states that Apple is making a series of major hires from the automotive world, creating a \"confidential Silicon Valley location\" to develop... something.\n\nAmong those hires? Johann Jungwirth, who until very recently was President and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America. His arrival, plus talk of other automotive engineers joining the ranks more quietly, has a lot of people speculating that Apple's next one more thing will be a car.\n\nI won't rule out Apple rolling out something on wheels sometime down the road, but for now, the most likely applications of this vehicular know-how are a lot more subtle -- but potentially a lot more interesting.\n\nHints from MBRDNA\n\nMercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, or MBRDNA as it's more tersely known, is the Silicon Valley epicenter for M-B's fancy thinking. I toured the facility when it opened in late 2013, and it is quite a place. Big and open and full of glass and brushed metal and, indeed, feeling very Apple-like.\n\nThat facility exists for a variety of reasons, perhaps chief among them establishing and building partnerships with other Valley startups, startups like Nest. Every room at MBRDNA has one or more of the smart thermostats stuck on the wall, 114 of the things overall.\n\nEveryone in the Valley is networking like their lives depends on it, but this sort of relationship points to a more subtle thing at MBRDNA: a desperate desire to make the car the center of your smart, contextualized life.\n\nFor example, while I was there, Jungwirth's team showed off a concept of a smart ski roof rack. NFC sensors could be attached to your skis, and then those planks, when clipped onto the roof, would tell the car to automatically program the navigation unit to your fabulous vacation home in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTouring the Mercedes-Benz Sunnyvale R&D center... See full gallery 1 - 4 / 24 Next Prev\n\nNow that frankly sounds a little silly, but it gets better. Not only would the car program in the destination, but it would call ahead to the Nest thermostat in your extravagent chalet and make sure it comes perfectly up to temperature just in time for you to walk through the front door and kick off your Uggs. (You would, sadly, have to start your own cup of hot cocoa.)\n\nThat's a very limited, rather unlikely scenario for most of us, but you can see the intent: rely on contextual information around the car to make your life better. The biggest problem for Mercedes-Benz is that the information available about you through your car is limited to say the least. Partnering with startups like Nest and Pebble and others gives more portals through which the car can look into your life.\n\nIn a car, you really only know what a user is doing for a few hours a day at the most. At Apple, that job of contextualizing your life is a lot easier. With a smartphone in their pocket, smart watch on their wrist, computer on their desk and various cloud services hovering overhead at all times, a lack of contextual clues will no longer be a problem for Jungwirth and his team.\n\nBuilding on CarPlay\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the most immediate thing we'll feel from this injection of automotive talent is a major boost to CarPlay. Tim Cook recently said that CarPlay is a \"key to our future\" at Apple, with the other two being HealthKit and HomeKit. So, it's reasonable to expect big investments here.\n\nApple CarPlay, the service in iOS that lets you safely access things like iTunes and Apple Maps from your dashboard, is a very young thing indeed, yet it's already making waves. Just about every major auto maker has pledged support -- including Mercedes-Benz -- and those who haven't surely will within the next year or so. When people see that they can stay connected while driving, and do so safely without breaking any distracted driving laws, they're going to want it (or Google's competing offering, Android Auto) in their next car.\n\nBut CarPlay is just a very simple thing right now, basically little more than a simplified view of iOS that's powered by your phone. No phone, no CarPlay.\n\nCarPlay will grow over the next year or two to include more features and functions, and the number of apps that can be controlled through the service will balloon, but it isn't hard to imagine a future revision of the service that does away with the phone requirement altogether.\n\nIf your music is in the cloud, your contacts in the cloud, your calendar and messages and lots of other juicy info up there too, who needs a phone to bring it into the car?\n\nRight now you do for two reasons: not all cars have active data connections, and auto manufacturers don't want Apple's software tied that closely into their dashboards. The first problem is rapidly disappearing, with more and more cars featuring cellular modems, while the second problem is really a question of willingness. That may take a little more time.\n\nBut, for the first brave car manufacturer to sign, the first car available with fully integrated Apple functionality could be quite a selling point. (Yes, I know having the first phone available with Apple functionality didn't work out well for the Moto Rokr, but I think we've all matured a lot in the 10 years since.)\n\nA self-driving Apple?\n\nThat all sounds practical enough, but gosh a car from Cupertino sounds juicy. Could Apple really be working on building a one? It's certainly possible. Apple currently has $178 billion in cash floating around. It could buy all the outstanding shares of Ford if it wanted, and General Motors too, and still have plenty of reserves to build a facility big enough for all the world's Mustang and Camaro fans to come together and better understand each others' differences.\n\nThe better question is whether it makes sense for Apple to build a car in the first place. In my opinion the answer is no, not yet, but that could change soon. As we've seen, Apple has struggled to get a television off the ground. A car is far more complicated, certainly in terms of manufacturing but also in terms of certifying the thing to be road-legal. Hell, as Tesla has shown, even selling the things is a headache.\n\nIf it wanted to, Apple could out-source the whole mess and let someone else do the hard work on the hardware, which is exactly what Google has done for its self-driving cars (manufactured by Detroit-based Roush Industries). But you can bet that Apple would want to have a much bigger hand in controlling the specifics of the design -- if only to make sure they don't wind up looking like clown cars. This would mean a major team of experienced mechanical engineers and industrial designers.\n\nApple in the fast lane\n\nWe still don't know exactly what the automotive future of Apple looks like. For the record, when I politely asked Apple representatives to tell me they politely declined to comment. At a minimum, I know that Johann Jungwirth built an amazing team of talent around him at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, and I expect him to do the same at Apple.\n\nIn the near-term, look for CarPlay to get bigger and better. Look for it to get smarter at figuring out what you want and finding ways to give it to you, and then expect for Apple's services to get much more deeply integrated right in the car.\n\nBut a self-driving car with a glowing Apple logo on the hood? Don't hold your breath on that.", "Is anyone safe from the malicious actions of cyber-criminals?

A White House official could not immediately say whether CEOs from major studios were invited.\n\n\"The North Korean cyber-attack on Sony Pictures destroyed data and disabled thousands of computers, and exposed the personal information of Sony employees,\" Obama said. \"And these attacks are hurting American companies and costing American jobs.\"\n\nLast month, the White House announced a number of measures it planned to pursue in the wake of the Sony hacking attack. The administration is pushing for legislation that encourages private sector companies to share cyber-threat information with the government, and in turn get \"targeted\" liability protection for sharing such information. It also is seeking legislation that would streamline a patchwork of state laws that set out how much time companies have to notify employees and customers of security breaches.\n\n\"So much of our computer networks and critical infrastructure are in the private sector, which means government cannot do this alone,\" Obama said. \"But the fact is that the private sector can't do it alone either, because it's government that often has the latest information on new threats.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the Obama administration also announced the formation of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, designed to coordinate intelligence gathering among federal agencies.\n\nProspects for the legislation are uncertain, given a range of disagreements on issues like privacy and data security.", "NEW YORK -- The S&P 500 set a new record, while the Dow closed above 18,000 for the first time this year.

And on a freaky Friday the 13th no less. But can the rally keep going?\n\nNext month will mark the sixth anniversary of the start of the current bull market. Many people have pointed out that stocks have never gone up for seven years in a row. So history is not on the side of the bulls.\n\nStill, it's hard to bet against stocks. Every time it seems that a new crisis is about to derail the market and lead to a huge pullback, buyers come rushing back.\n\nWe're still overdue for a correction: Forget about a 20% drop that would note a bear market. We haven't had a 10% correction since 2011.\n\nThe big concerns that spooked investors last month are starting to fade away a bit.\n\nOil prices have rebounded to back above $50 a barrel.\n\nFears of Greece leaving the eurozone haven't gone away but many experts are stubbornly clinging to the hope that Greece's many creditors and the new Greek leaders will avoid the worst-case scenario.\n\nCentral banks around the world (with the notable exception of the Federal Reserve) are slashing interest rates and/or buying bonds to fight slowing growth and the threat of deflation. This injection of liquidity could keep stocks afloat for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe dollar has weakened a little bit lately as a result. So some of the concerns about a stronger greenback hurting earnings for multinational giants like Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble could turn out to be temporary.\n\nStrong earnings, particularly from tech companies, have helped boost sentiment as well. Apple, Facebook, Netflix and Cisco have all reported solid results.\n\nBond prices have plummeted this month too after surging in January. And that's pushed yields, which move in the opposite direction of bonds, on the 10-Year Treasury back toward 2%.\n\nGood signs for America: Mark Spellman, portfolio manager for the Alpine Equity Income Fund, added that investors are encouraged by continued signs of economic strength in the United States.\n\nHe noted that the January jobs report was particularly positive since wage growth picked up. Add the expected benefit of lower gas prices and consumers should be able to keep spending at a decent pace.\n\n\"There is some irrefutable evidence here that the U.S. economy is doing pretty darn well,\" Spellman said.\n\nJohn Buckingham, chief investment officer of AFAM Capital and editor of the Prudent Speculator newsletter, said that even though long-term rates have picked up, there are many quality dividend paying stocks that offer a lot more growth potential than bonds.\n\nSo for now at least, the bull is raging. Investors are happy to embrace risk again.\n\nToo much euphoria? But there are reasons to be worried that stock prices are too frothy -- just like in 2000.\n\nPaul Ehrlichman, head of global value equity at ClearBridge Investments, said he thinks that the continued infatuation with U.S. stocks is a \"crowded trade.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 is now valued at 17 times 2015 earnings estimates. That is not cheap -- especially when you consider that analysts are only predicting 3% earnings growth this year.\n\nEhrlichman thinks investors are too negative about the rest of the world and that there are better values in Europe, China and Japan.\n\nIt's also important to remember that market volatility is probably here to stay for awhile.\n\nStocks could turn on a dime if something goes wrong in Greece. Or the Ukraine ceasefire collapses. Or if there are more problems in the Middle East. Or if oil prices suddenly plunge again. China's economy could slow faster than expected.\n\nYou get the picture. Many of the risks that everyone was freaking about in January haven't magically disappeared.

Previously, this two-step verification process existed to protect Apple accounts, when users opted-in, and was later applied to iCloud after the security breach that happened late in 2014 - which revealed a number of celebrities personal photos. Now though, the feature will be available for anyone who wants to utilize it - which will give an added layer of security to iMessage and FaceTime - which already include mild encryption - at least to the point of protecting user's messages from outside intrusion.\n\nThe new two-step process really is not that difficult and will focus on preventing people who are not authorized to access an Apple account - from doing so, in an effort to collect text messages, or FaceTime information. The move was announced on Thursday by Apple, and was received in a very positive light. While Apple hasn't had any major security breaches since the iCloud photo scandal - it remained hot on user's minds as they become more entrenched with the digital landscape, and more aware of ill-minded users trying to hack their personal accounts.\n\nServices like Facebook, Twitter, and even Google have added two-step verification processes to ensure that user's information is safe - which makes Apple last to arrive at two-step verification for this particular service. However, two-step verification is not necessarily bulletproof as it has many of its own shortcomings. The process though is significantly less risky than other methods of keeping login credentials safe.\n\nFor those who are looking to take advantage - the process is relatively simple. The simplest method to completing and setting up your two-step verification is by going to applied.apple.com and following the on-screen instructions - which really just include entering your information, and obtaining a recovery key. At the end of the process the user will have a 4-digit key, in addition to a traditional password - which will add the second layer of protection. While the process may sound relatively simple, the added security it brings to the table is really important. It's worth noting that Apple rolled this type of security out for iCloud shortly after the original breach occurred, which cost many individuals their personal information and photos. This only allows users to remain in control of their devices, and prevent other devices - which are not trusted - from gaining access to their accounts without proper authority and information.", "Apple(WASHINGTON) -- Apple Pay, the payment system that is shaping up to be a plastic credit card killer, has received a vote of support from the White House.\n\nSpeaking at the White House's cybersecurity summit at Stanford Friday, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the payment system, which uses unique one-time codes to keep purchases and financial information private, would be supported for many transactions with the federal government beginning in September.\n\nThe move includes everything from federal payments cards to simply paying for admission to a National Park.\n\n\"We can imagine a day in the not so distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past,\" Cook said.\n\nApple Pay launched in October and is available on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for use in participating brick and mortar stores.\n\nAll users have to do is position their iPhone near one of the readers at a store, hold their finger on their Touch ID and they're good to go.

Too many people are not free to practice their religion, or speak their mind, or love who they choose,\" Cook said. \"If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right to privacy, we risk far more than money ... we risk our way of life.\"\n\nAmerican Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault said there was ample room for improving cooperation against hacking.\n\nThough the card issuer scans constantly for threats, Chenault said only 5 percent of the cases the company finds are already the subject of warnings from other members in the financial sector's well-regarded Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Only 1 percent of the threats has already been flagged by the federal government.\n\n\"Information-sharing may be the single highest-impact, lowest-cost and fastest way to implement capabilities we have in hand as a nation to accelerate our overall defense,\" Chenault said.\n\nMALICIOUS ACTIVITY\n\nThe White House wants businesses to exchange more information about any attacks as rapidly as possible.\n\nWhile at Stanford, Obama signed an executive order aimed making that happen by promoting hubs where companies can share information with each other and with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIf emails hit employees at one company with a link to a website loaded with code that can give hackers access to the network, that company should feel free to warn its competitors without worrying about antitrust or privacy rules, the White House argues.\n\nThe administration would like to automate the process as much as possible, so that machines would be informed what malicious websites or email addresses to block within minutes.\n\n\"The information we want to be moving is the information on things that actually indicate malicious activity. And so that's malware indicators, that's indicators of compromise, that's bad IP addresses,\" Michael Daniel, the White House's cybersecurity coordinator, told reporters.\n\nObama's executive order is one step in a long effort to make companies as well as privacy and consumer advocates more comfortable with proposed legislation that would offer firms protection from being sued for handing over customer information to the government.\n\nSome executives said cybersecurity issues were leading to greater fragmentation of global business, and that the private sector could not overcome that without more serious discussion between governments.\n\n\"There's a protectionism developing,\" said Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. \"You've got to store the data here, you've got to use these providers.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Joseph Menn, Julia Edwards and Amanda Becker;

The Council has agreed to conduct an outreach meeting in all nine Council districts.\n\n\"This is a major undertaking for the City of Long Beach,\" said 8th District Councilmember Al Austin. \"The City Council has voted to move forward and has selected a design team we think has come back with the best design and package.\"\n\nThe council member said that, while the development team has already brought forward a design, the \"vision\" for the project won't be complete without \"robust community participation and input.\"\n\nWith construction expected to begin in 2016, the project includes building a new City Hall, a new Port headquarters and a new main library. It also includes completely redeveloping Lincoln Park while adding private development, including a 30-story residential tower that would have 600 permanent residential units, 200 units for hotel use and 40,000 square feet of retail on the ground floor.\n\nThe Council's decision to move forward with the downtown overhaul was prompted by seismic studies, first conducted in 2005 and 2006 out of federal mandates, that declared that both City Hall, which houses 896 employees, and the main library that were built in the late 1970s are \"significantly seismically deficient\" and would be public-safety risks in an earthquake.\n\nMike Conway, Long Beach director of economic and property development, said during the meeting this week that the City has been able to take measures, such as removing dirt from the roof of the existing library and installing shelters in the current City Hall building, to reduce the risk of loss of life in a major seismic event.\n\nHowever, he said a seismic study conducted in 2013 indicated that, in a large earthquake, the fourth through seventh floors of City Hall would \"wobble,\" causing steel to compromise and forcing portions of the building to collapse. This new study is what propelled the City to move more quickly on the currently proposed project, Conway said.\n\n\"We were much more compelled to proceed and determine an alternative to City Hall in a more rapid fashion because we didn't want to get exposed to loss of life either for staff or visitors to City Hall,\" he said.\n\nConway and project designers stated during the meeting that the new City Hall building, Port headquarters and main library would be completed and ready for occupancy in the next four to five years and would exceed current building codes for seismic standards. Former 8th District Councilmember Rae Gabelich questioned why the City hasn't brought forward a cheaper or quicker alternative. Conway responded, however, by stating that the public-private partnership, also known as a P3 project, is the \"fastest route.\" However, he admitted that, until the new structures are built, the City faces \"some significant liability.\"\n\nCity staff has noted that retrofitting City Hall would cost an estimated $170 million when including design and engineering costs and moving and lease expenses for temporary facilities during construction.\n\nHowever, rebuilding the Civic Center through a P3, the same development model used for the construction of the Governor George Deukmejian Courthouse in downtown Long Beach, would cost no more than $12.6 million annually (plus inflation), the City's current costs for maintaining the Civic Center structures.\n\nThe majority of the project, aside from the new Port headquarters, is being paid for through private loans with interest as part of the financing model. The developer, which would take over maintenance of the entire Civic Center structures for 40 years, would also be given a portion of City-owned property, estimated to be worth about $30 million, as an incentive for private development.\n\nDuring the meeting, Jeff Fullerton, director of Costa Mesa-based Edgemoor Infrastructure & Real Estate, presented renderings and a 3D model of what the team has so far designed for the project. He said some residents, so far, have expressed interest in bringing in small-business retailers, a seasonal ice rink or making it more \"market friendly\" with crafts and farm-fresh food.\n\n\"We're looking for 'What's the draw?'\" asked Fullerton, who worked on the courthouse project in Long Beach as well. \"What's going to bring you downtown?\"\n\nA majority of 8th District residents, however, explained that the main disincentive to shopping and visiting downtown is the need to pay for parking.\n\nFormer Long Beach 9th District councilmember Val Lerch said he frequents restaurants in Lakewood Center Mall rather than downtown because of parking costs in addition to dealing with public-safety risks related to transients.\n\n\"I think, probably, most everybody here don't go down there as often because of the parking we have to pay for,\" he said. \"And then, when we get downtown, we walk and we got to deal with knuckleheads.\"\n\nFullerton, however, noted that 17,000 parking spaces currently exist in downtown, mostly in parking structures, aside from 850 new spaces for the project. He said the project might entail offering parking-validation options.\n\nIn regard to homelessness, Fullerton explained that redeveloping Lincoln Park, including adding lush landscaping, spaces with \"event lawns\" and connecting 1st Street and other streets into a \"pedestrian plaza,\" would, over time, help make the site a place for \"everybody\" to enjoy.\n\nHe added that the Santa Monica Promenade was once completely occupied by homeless, but, as people found more reasons to visit the area, it became more of a place for the \"general, broad cross section of the public.\"\n\nFullerton added that addressing homelessness is \"a challenging problem\" and the development team plans to work with local agencies to assist the homeless. He noted that the project is expected to create 3,700 new local jobs.\n\nSome residents, however, were skeptical about the project, expressing disdain about retail development that has taken shape in downtown, specifically The Pike, which Bixby Knolls resident Ken Cordua called \"a shabby, nasty-looking place with bad architecture.\"\n\nCordua said he would like to see \"high-quality\" retailers. However, the only proposal for a new retailer was from Gabelich, who suggested bringing in an Apple computer store.\n\n\"I have had a hard time saying, 'yeah, let's go for it,' when I've seen so many other projects fail and it's just one disappointment after another,\" Cordua said. \"So I wish you the best of luck going forward, but I do want to see something that's attractive with quality retail and great restaurants. I don't care about parking. I can walk a few blocks. It doesn't matter to me. I just want something that is a high-end, quality project.\" \u00df", "Take a bite out of this: genetically modified apples that won't brown when sliced or bruised have been cleared for growing in the United States.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two varieties of biotech apples developed by Canadian company Okanagan Specialty Fruits -- one called Arctic Granny, and the other Arctic Golden.\n\nThe Arctic apples are engineered so that their browning enzyme is inhibited. The company hopes these new varieties will drive up demand and sales of apples by making the fruit more appealing.\n\nOkanagan president Neal Carter lauded the USDA's decision.\n\n\"The commercial approval of Arctic apples, our company's flagship product, is the biggest milestone yet for us, and we can't wait until they're available for consumers,\" Carter said in a statement.\n\nHe also maintained that the apples' \"nutrition and composition is equivalent to their conventional counterparts.\"\n\nBut many are wary of Arctic apples. The U.S. Apple Association -- which represents the nation's apple industry -- believes they could harm the fruit's wholesome, healthy image. Additionally, The Organic Consumer's Association says the genetic modifications could be harmful to human health, and is calling on food outlets not to use the apples.\n\nDespite push-back, the USDA maintains that Arctic apples are \"not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment.\" The apples are now undergoing a voluntary safety assessment with the Food and Drug Administration."]}, "Tesla": {"2015-02-12": ["NEW YORK: US stocks ended sharply higher on Thursday, with a rally in technology stocks leading the Nasdaq to a 15-year high, while a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine also eased tensions.\n\nThe day's gains were broad, with eight of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors rising, and the S&P information technology sector rose 1.6 per cent in its third straight daily advance.

(CSCO) was up 9.17 % to $29.40 with a net income of $2.4 billion or increase of 68 %. Tesla Motors (TSLA) was down 4.74 % to $202.72 on a revenue decrease of $1.1 billion. The miss was attributed to a delivery delay on about 1400 vehicles. They were estimated to deliver 11,142 cars yet could not due to client vacations, harsh weather conditions and shipping problems. The stronger US Dollar may have also played a role in the disappointing report. As a matter of fact about half of the sales in the S&P 500 companies are reliant on foreign purchases where the US Dollar may deter with a higher purchase price. The US budget deficit widened in January perhaps due to the government adopted health care services for financially challenged citizens. The Wholesale Trade Inventories for December was 0.1 % while the previous reading was 0.8 %. This may contribute to a weaker GDP later this month. The last US employment report came in at 257,000 new jobs created last month. US Fed Chairperson Janet Yellen had concerns about wage growth and underutilized resources, but the report showed an increase of 0.5 % increase in average hourly earnings. The manufacturing sector increased their work force by 22,000 jobs. Construction workers jobs increased by 39,000. Retail employees increased by 45,900. Due to the lower oil prices, the energy sector decreased their work force by 1,900 jobs. Government workers decreased by 10,000 jobs. The temporary work decreased by 4,100. Consumer Credit increased an annually adjusted rate of 5.4 % or $14.8 billion for December. Revolving credit such as credit card debt increased at a 7.9 % rate. The Non-revolving debt such as student loans and automobiles increased at a 4.5 % adjusted annual rate. This may support the US Dollar, yet the dollar strength may be a hindrance in growth. The trade deficit widened meaning that the US is exporting less goods and importing more. Dollar strength just makes US goods more expensive for foreign buyers. The trade gap was $46.6 billion.\n\nGreece is still in talks and will be at least until the end of this month. As of February 28th, the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) may only provide funding to solvent countries. Therefore, if Greece cannot come to terms with its creditors by the end of the month, it may have an exit from the Euro Zone. The International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Euro Zone as a whole are trying very hard to come up with some sort of bridge to allow the negotiations more time, so the ailing country may reach some accord. The New Greek Prime Minister is still in negotiations regarding the national debt and terms. He states that \"What is critical is that Greece's debt cannot be paid off in the near future\". Other potential terms may include a haircut reducing the debt burden or extensions may make plans feasible for the 240 euro bailout. Debt forgiveness is what the Euro leaders do not want to hear. While the meeting in Brussels had no solution on the horizon, the Finance Minister said that a Greek exit from the Euro Zone was not up for discussion. There are many other possibilities here that may play out. The new Greek Prime Minister may seek bailout funds from other resources such as the US, China or possibly Russia. He wants a deal and so far the negotiations have proven static. Germany has typically a firm stand on monetary issues whereas Greece may feel that 70 % of the reforms are fulfilling the demands. For now, Greece seems to be working on a 10 billion euro bridge plan. The European Union heads are to meet for a regular meeting is scheduled for February 16th. The new Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is talking of increasing the minimum wage, ceasing the infrastructure privatizations and restoring the tax cuts for the country. The credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's have either downgraded or put on review for a downgrade the country. Of course, for now a bridge is necessary so that Greece can survive until the terms of its next tranche of funding are agreed upon. Should nothing be agreed upon, there still is the possibility that Greece may return to the Drachma and exit the European Union. The Greek leader, in the meantime may try to secure new loans while trying to write down the debt of previous loans.\n\nThe Initial Jobless Claims for the week of February 7th was up 25,000 to 304,000 new claims while the previous reading was 278,000.

Germany's DAX index finished at its 11th record close of the year after rising 1.6%, while the Stoxx Europe 600 index added 0.75%. Meanwhile, eurozone finance ministers vowed to continue negotiations after six-hour talks failed to find a way to resolve Greece's financial issues.\n\nThe news helped ease concerns over the political and economic fortunes of Europe, which have buffeted stocks in recent weeks.\n\n\"The market really has changed its stripes in a positive way on its view of Europe,\" said Joe Spinelli, who heads single-stock trading in the Americas for Deutsche Bank . \"It definitely helps from a sentiment perspective that you've got some resolution over in Ukraine.\"\n\nStrong earnings also gave stocks a lift. Shares of Dow component Cisco Systems Inc. soared 9.4%, contributing 16 points to the blue-chip index. The company reported higher revenue and net income and boosted its dividend.\n\nIn the Markets ENLARGE A bright spot for investors has been the recent slate of positive earnings reports. A jump in Cisco Systems' shares after the company reported strong earnings buoyed the Dow on Thursday.

McGraw Hill Financial Inc. jumped 4.1% after reporting adjusted earnings that exceeded expectations.\n\nInvestors have been encouraged by a recent string of positive quarterly earnings reports. In early January, analysts had expected fourth-quarter profits to rise just 1.1% for S&P 500 companies, marking the slowest pace of earnings growth since the third quarter of 2012, according to FactSet.\n\nBut those forecasts have so far proven too dire. While contracting profits in the energy and financial sectors have curbed earnings gains overall, double-digit growth in the health-care, industrial and telecommunications sectors have cushioned the blow. About three-fourths of S&P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings, and profits are now on track to rise 3.9%, according to FactSet. A big contributor was the 38% rise in quarterly profits by Apple Inc., the largest company by market capitalization.\n\n\"All in all, given where we were three weeks ago, things are substantially better,\" said Jeff Yu, head of single stock derivatives trading at UBS . \"The flows we're seeing definitely are more constructive. People are buying stocks. People are reinvesting.\"\n\nMr. Spinelli, of Deutsche Bank, said he has noticed a more bullish tilt among investor clients, encouraged in part by improving U.S. economic data. He said a number of investors have lately been shifting out of more defensive pockets of the market, such as utilities, and into riskier areas like technology stocks.\n\nS&P 500 utilities stocks fell 0.5% on Thursday and have shed 5.5% so far in February. The S&P 500's information technology sector, meanwhile, advanced 1.6% Thursday and 6.1% for the month.\n\n\"On an overall basis, I still think we're in a bull market,\" said Martin Sass, head of the $7.5-billion money manager M.D. Sass. \"I don't see the forces that tend to end bull markets -- namely no recession on the horizon, no meaningful increase in bond yields, and little inflation. So it's a good environment overall.\"\n\nMr. Sass said the recent volatility has presented buying opportunities, though he has been avoiding energy stocks until oil prices find an equilibrium.\n\nIn deal news, Expedia Inc. agreed to buy Orbitz Worldwide Inc. for about $1.3 billion. Shares of Orbitz jumped 22% and those of Expedia rose 15%.\n\nShares of American Express Co. fell 6.4% after the company said its merchant agreement with Costco Wholesale Corp. will end next year. Shares of Costco gained 0.2%.\n\nShares of Tesla Motors Inc. fell 4.7% after the company said its fourth-quarter loss widened to $108 million, while deliveries of its $71,000-and-up luxury electric cars fell short of its forecast.\n\nIn economic news, jobless claims in the week ended Feb. 7 rose 25,000 to 304,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 290,000 claims. The level of claims was consistent with solid job growth.\n\nRetail sales fell in January for the second month in a row, fueling worries that the drop in gasoline prices isn't translating into more consumer spending. Sales fell 0.8% last month to $439.77 billion, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.5% decline.\n\nIn commodity markets, crude-oil futures gained 4.9% to $51.21 a barrel. Gold futures added 0.1% to $1220.10 an ounce. Treasury prices rose, pushing the 10-year yield down to 1.983% from 1.987% on Wednesday.\n\n-- Saumya Vaishampayan contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com", "Don't get caught up with ambitious mid/long-term targets...: Despite the weak quarter, there was enough to keep the die-hard bulls interested.

This further validates our below-guidance view on a number of metrics.\n\nJohnson, who warned that it could be difficult for Tesla to make the jump to mainstream automaker in a note last week, also reduced his price target on Tesla to $190 from $200.\n\nShares of Tesla Motors have fallen 4.9% t $202.37 at 3:33 p.m., while Apple has gained 1.2% to $126.38.", "Tesla Motors' stock tumbled after the electric car maker led by Elon Musk missed targets for vehicle deliveries and reported an unexpected loss.\n\nThe shares fell as much as 9.2 percent Thursday after Tesla reported a fourth-quarter loss, excluding certain items, of 13 cents a share. Analysts had anticipated a profit of 32 cents a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla delivered a record 9,834 vehicles, missing the average analyst estimate by almost 1,000 and its own goal by 1,345.\n\nThe shortfalls, which Musk blamed on the winter weather and customers' holiday travel, raised concerns about the company's ability to maintain profitability while building cars faster and faster. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said a second straight quarter of profit margins below estimates related to production challenges, such as securing as many high-end seat options as customers wanted, led it to downgrade the stock to underweight from neutral.\n\nTesla fell 7.5 percent to $196.79 at 9:33 a.m. New York time. Shares that rose eightfold over 18 months to Sept. 4, lost a quarter of their value by Wednesday's close, before the fourth-quarter results were announced.\n\nThe past two quarters \"highlight the execution risk associated with scaling production,\" Ryan Brinkman, the JPMorgan analyst, wrote in a note to investors.\n\nThe company said too many cars were finished at the end of the year and couldn't be delivered in 2014 because of holidays and weather. With a backlog of orders equal to projected first- quarter production, Tesla bumped up its forecast for deliveries this year by 10 percent to 55,000 -- 74 percent more than last year's total.\n\n\"The stock is down because they missed on deliveries, revenue and earnings,\" said Theo O'Neill, an analyst with Ascendiant Capital Markets. \"But the miss has nothing to do with demand.\"\n\nMusk said last month that sales in China have declined in recent months because consumers have been reluctant to switch to electric vehicles due to perceptions that home charging is difficult and that public chargers are too scarce.\n\nHe said lack of demand in China wasn't the reason for the fourth-quarter miss and won't limit vehicle sales this year, stressing that Tesla would reach the 55,000-vehicle target even if it sold no cars in China.\n\n\"In the long term, we do want to succeed in China and make sure we are doing a good job,\" he said. \"The biggest issue that we are fighting to address is the perception that it's difficult to charge in China.\"\n\nTo that end, Tesla said it will install chargers at buyers' homes before the vehicle is delivered, which Musk said rivals already do in China. The automaker is also adding features such as a second-row center console for owners who are driven.\n\nTesla didn't report how many deliveries it made to customers in China.\n\n\"They got off on the wrong foot in China, and it's going to take more time to figure it out,\" O'Neill said.\n\nThe company's plan to make about $1.5 billion in capital expenditures this year has the kind of \"intensity\" usually seen at traditional automakers, said Brinkman, the JPMorgan analyst. He had estimated that Tesla would spend about $900 million.\n\n\"While other automakers are beginning to emulate Tesla in important respects, it is not lost on us that Tesla is in some ways beginning to look more like other automakers,\" he said in the note.\n\nFourth-quarter deliveries reached a record 9,834 vehicles, 12 percent less than Tesla needed to reach its full-year target of 33,000. Full-year sales totaled 31,655 cars. Thanks to a \"herculean effort,\" the company was able to reach its 2015 production goal of 35,000 cars, even after delaying release of its all-wheel drive model \"to ensure it would be a truly great experience for owners,\" Musk and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe Palo Alto, Calif., company said it has received almost 20,000 Model X reservations and entered the year with a backlog of 10,000 Model S orders.\n\nDemand was spurred by the addition of all-wheel-drive versions of the car and capabilities such as adaptive cruise control and automatic high-beam dimming. New features will be added in the first and second quarters, Tesla said.\n\nThe company said it will be able to assemble 2,000 vehicles a week by the end of 2015.\n\nDespite missing estimates on deliveries, revenue and profit, which have been anticipated since Musk's comments about China in January, the report was positive, said Ben Kallo, a San Francisco-based analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.\n\n\"The guidance of 55,000 deliveries this year is in line, and they're still on track for Model X timing,\" he said.\n\nAt the rate it's growing, if all goes right, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple Inc. in about a decade, Musk said.\n\nWith 2015 revenue of about $6 billion and growing at 50 percent a year for 10 years with a 10 percent profit margin and a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, the future Tesla could be worth about $700 billion, Musk said.\n\n\"Our market cap would be basically the same as Apple's is today,\" Musk said.", "New York (AFP) - US stocks posted solid gains Thursday, rallying on news of a ceasefire in Ukraine as strong earnings from Cisco lifted the technology sector.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 110.24 points (0.62 percent) to 17,972.38.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 jumped 19.95 (0.96 percent) to 2,088.48, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index surged 56.43 (1.18 percent) to 4,857.61.\n\nThe US gains followed a strong day for European equities after the announcement of a peace roadmap between Kiev and pro-Russian rebels.

Coincidentally, one of these prototypes was spotted by a Tesla Motors Club forum member, just hours ahead of Musk's big call.\n\nThe camo-clad Model X prototype shows much of the same design as the original concept, barring the addition of real sideview mirrors as opposed to the video cameras Musk would prefer. You can clearly make out the falcon-wing doors, which are partly responsible for the repeated delays of Model X deliveries. From the back, it looks a lot like other crossovers and SUVs on the road with a fat booty and high waistline. The front end also looks a like like the Model S sedan, which should come as no surprise since the two vehicles share a platform.\n\nLast night Musk mentioned that there are features on the Model X the public doesn't even know about yet. Considering features we already know about, like the falcon-wing doors, towing capacity (a first for a production electric vehicle), Dual Motor all-wheel drive, and an optional third row of seating, it's hard to imagine what Musk might have in store.\n\nFor those Tesla Model X reservation holders, these spy pics are the closest we'll get to seeing the electric SUV before deliveries begin later this year.", "US economic data disappointed today, but markets rallied hard on a peace accord between Ukraine and Russian separtists.\n\nFollowing a meeting in Minsk, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France announced a peace agreement to end the fighting in Ukraine.

Uber gets a lot of attention in this space, as does its direct competitors Lyft, Sidecar, and Hailo to mention but a few, not to mention its predecessor Zipcar, but a slew of new entrants aren't just emulating, they're rethinking the mobility market as we know it.\n\n-- -- --\n\nDrivy: Peer-to-Peer Car Rentals. Started in 2010, this \"rent the car next door\" or \"Airbnb for car rental\" service allows you to rent out your car to others when you're not using it and/or looking to make a buck. Similar to Buzzcar (started by Robin Chase, founder of Zipcar), it turns your car, which tends to sit in a parking lot for 23 out of 24 hours a day, into a revenue stream. By side-stepping car rental agencies, you can expect some recalcitrance from that sector, but this Paris-based service is backed by insurance giant Allianz, so insurance is automatically covered. With 400,000 members and counting, we'll see if car rental agencies fight them, or join them.\n\nBlaBlaCar: Cooky Name, but Bigger than You Realize. Already in 14 markets (including Turkey and Russia, and now expanding to India) and with a $100 million fundraising round completed, this service caters to inter-city travel. If someone is for example driving from Paris to Lyon, you can earn a buck taking on other passengers, or save a buck getting there compared to other alternatives. This service is also based in Paris, and competes in a different mobility space, usually limited to long-distance buses and trains.\n\nBeepi: Used Cars You Might Actually Trust. If you thought dealerships were angry with Tesla Motors for cutting them out of the car purchase transaction, wait until they realize what Beepi (and others) hopes to do to them. Not only is it going for lower margins than traditional dealers, but it's looking to use third-party information to verify that the car you buy will work, which means: goodbye dealerships. The company operates in 140 cities across the United States.\n\nScoot: Bringing New Mobility to Two-wheelers. Scoot just started up in San Francisco, and hopes to become something between Zipcar and the now-defunct Project Better Place, with the ability of picking up all-electric scooters at a number of stations, which come with helmets. The cool part? You dock your smartphone into the Scooter which then relays all necessary information. Nifty stuff, and we'll see if it spreads any farther than tech-savvy SF. Meanwhile, similar efforts are underway in Vietnam, and elsewhere.\n\nAll Thai Taxi: Upcoming Entrant in a Crowded Market. Not yet launched, but promising to fight in Bangkok's crowded turf against Uber and GrabTaxi (Southeast Asia's response to Uber). This service looks a lot like Uber, but is backed-up by a local intercity bus company, and will launch in April with 500 Prius sedans.\n\n-- -- --\n\nSo what does this all add up to? For one, Paris appears to be more of a mobility hub than I first thought. The city hosts not just Velib' and Autolib', but also BlaBlaCar and Drivy. Meanwhile, the city is suffering from spectacular pollution and congestion, so perhaps it's no wonder that solutions are springing forth to meet these challenges? And outside Paris, Asia is, as with all things, the market to watch. Besides the ones mentioned above, Japan just got its home-grown Uber-challenger: Line Taxi. And China is not sitting idly by either.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that in this economy, efficiency does not just mean leaner light bulbs; it means better use of existing resources such as Airbnb or Buzzcar. The new mobility revolution is fully underway, and we can now imagine a full week of travel using all of the above services, with one serious implication: cutting the middle man out.", "RENO, Nev.

Yet Tesla isn't quite hitting its earlier projections. Last summer, Musk anticipated delivering 13,000 Model S cars in the quarter to December, but deliveries fell about 25 percent short of that.\n\nThe company also burned $455 million of cash as it prepared for the delayed launch of the Model X. Musk, though, is eyeing a much bigger picture, saying on a call with investors that Tesla would \"spend staggering amounts of money on capex\" because the opportunities are so great. Besides cars, the company plans this year to ship battery systems for home electricity storage.\n\nThe entrepreneur mused on the notion that Tesla could be worth some 30 times its current market value in a decade, assuming a forecast $6 billion of sales in 2015 can grow 30 percent annually, the company makes a 10 percent net margin, and investors attach a valuation multiple of 20 times earnings. Do the math, and it doesn't quite get there.\n\nAt Musk's already aggressive growth rate, it would take more than 15 years to reach a $700 billion valuation. To do it in a decade, Tesla would have to increase its top line at 50 percent per year. Either way, it's a shift in outlook from Musk's comments in 2013 that Tesla's valuation was \"more than we deserve.\" The vision also calls for a consistently astonishing rate of growth.\n\nApple has shown that it's possible. But there's only room for a tiny number of companies to grow that much faster than the global economy for that long.\n\nRivals catch up, new technologies emerge, big companies grow lethargic, and markets get indigestion.

It would take 26 years, based on rough calculations by Reuters, unless it starts selling a lot more cars.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk surprised analysts on the company's earnings call on Wednesday by saying that his company could be worth $700 billion by 2025. That is roughly the same size as Apple Inc, the most valuable company in the Standard and Poor's 500 index, is worth now.\n\nInvestors were quick to point out that reaching that goal would require a jump of 2,700 percent in the value of Tesla's shares, given its market value of $26.6 billion.\n\nActually, at its current annual production rate of 55,000 cars a year, the company would have to sell every car until 2040 to get to that market cap.\n\nMore likely, Musk expects the production rate to expand, but the question is by how much? Today, every Tesla car represents $463,636 in market cap. Assuming that ratio remains unchanged, it would take sales of 1.45 million cars every year to justify a $700 billion figure and the same investor faith in future growth.\n\nBy Musk's 2025 target date, everyone who currently bought a Tesla would have to convince 26 of his best friends and relatives to buy one as well.\n\nToyota Motor Corp , by comparison, sold 10.2 million cars worldwide last year.

A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford Motor Co. engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nIn September, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple's campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and accompanying iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.\n\nManufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components. Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Motors Inc., said last fall that it is \"really hard\" to make a car, as the company struggled to ramp up production on its Model S sedan.\n\nThe expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27, 2014.\n\nTesla was able to ramp its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former Toyota Motor Corp. factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.\n\nAuto makers tend to operate their own factories. Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build all of its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.\n\nApple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its Car Play service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle's dashboard information system.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several designers that have work experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr. Newson has created a concept car for Ford.\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Magna International, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=CA5592224011\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Apple, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tesla Motors, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US88160R1014\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-13-151809ET Copyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines\n\nReferenced Stocks: AAPL , MGA , TSLA", "Tesla Motors has a bit of a reputation for not being as transparent as some would like. So, when the end of the fiscal quarter arrives, there's always a lot of interest in the financial statements the company is obligated to release. But the info and insights don't just flow from its official 8K filing. The automaker also holds a conference call that sees CEO Elon Musk, CTO JB Straubel and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja taking questions from assorted financial analysts for an hour or so. It's here that we often learn interesting details behind the numbers, as well as hints of what's to come, sandwiched between quotable quotes from Musk.\n\nThis week's call, following the release of 2014 fourth quarter financial results, certainly didn't disappoint. When asked by a Barclay's representative how much money Tesla will put towards capital expenditures over the next several years, for example, the irrepressible Musk said the company was \"going to spend staggering amounts.\"\n\nThis, of course, makes sense when you consider the massive amount of work the outfit has already bit off and has begun chewing. There's the production preparation for the Model X, a multi-billion dollar battery \"gigafactory\" under construction, the growing of its store and service center infrastructure along with its Supercharger network, and Model 3 development. Still, the gleeful tone, when discussing the spending of billions of dollars, seems contrary to what one might expect during such a call. But, it's also part of what keeps these teleconferences from being a total snooze fest. That, and the unexpected mention of new products and candid discussion of challenges.\n\nSpeaking of challenges, the situation in China was probably the biggest thing on most minds of company followers and was addressed early. Tesla's sales have been surprisingly lackluster there and Musk was quick to admit that, \"we didn't execute on China super well last year\" relaying how its sales team was actually telling potential customers it might be difficult for them to charge. He balanced out the bad news with the consolation that even if it had of delivered more in the territory, it wouldn't have affected this financial statement much, since the Model S is production-constrained, and any slack in one market is made up by demand in others. He did, though, make it clear that he expects things in the People's Republic to improve and to \"be in good shape by the end of the year.\"\n\nWhat else did we learn from the call? Lets' make a list, shall we?\n\nTesla will keep its residual value guarantee program in place. Musk claims it's not really necessary and makes the company's financials a little less shiny, but getting rid of it might be seen as a loss of confidence in its product. Musk would bet that Tesla will be worth as much as Apple is today - around $700 billion - in 10 years. He gets there by assuming it will maintain it current growth rate, \"achieve a ten percent profitability number and have a twenty P/E ( price/earnings ratio).\" Tesla won't set up a joint venture in China or sell through dealer groups there in the next couple years and it is seeing orders there trending positive since making management changes and improving the region's maps and other features in the Model S. Tesla has no plans to raise more money through capital markets in the near term. Tesla has no plans to raise prices, despite strong demand, beyond what its done already in some markets to offset falling currency values. Ahuja expects the company will be cash-flow positive by the end of the year, despite significant planned capital expenditures. Musk says it will be profitable under GAAP in 2020, has been non-GAAP profitable the past two years. The initial vehicles built on the Model 3 platform (in the second half of 2017) will be more conservative than what might come later, in order in make sure timeline doesn't slip. The all-wheel-drive P85D has been more popular than they'd expected, as has demand for the new, optional seats. The design of the Tesla stationary battery homes is done and will be revealed within the next month or two, with production starting in about six months. The company is also talking to a lot of utilities about energy storage, though those projects are farther out in the future. Musk really loves the middle seat in the Model X, calling it a thing of \"sculptural beauty\" and \"the nicest second row seat you've seen in any car ever.\" According to the CEO, their creation \"might have been harder than the (falcon-wing) door.\" The Model X will have features that we don't know about yet, but they won't be revealed until deliveries begin. Musk expects demand to stay strong through this year and sees no need for discounts, paid celebrity endorsements, or ad campaigns. He did say, though, that he has a \"secret weapon\" to generate further demand that he might \"start to deploy later this year\" that could be a \"good weapon against the dealers.\" Musk says there is a new software release coming next month that will \"positively affect the entire fleet\" which will also actuate some autopilot capability for those cars equipped with the appropriate sensors.

Tesla has said that, \"Over 30 Beta Model X vehicles have been built and are undergoing extensive testing,\" and now people are starting to see it happen. The photos were grabbed from Facebook and posted to Tesla Motors Club forums, where the upcoming SUV can be seen cruising around the area near Tesla's Fremont, California factory (one photo was taken at the intersection of Marshlands Rd. and Thornton Ave. about 10 miles across town). See the photos at Tesla Motors Club.\n\nMulti-family homes are growing in demand near the Tesla Gigafactory. Rent is increasing in the area, vacancy rates are at a record low and the influx of people means more housing is needed. The Bourbon Square Casino in Sparks, Nevada announced the building has been sold, and will be converted into multi-family homes and offices. About 1,100 multi-family units are currently under development in Reno. Besides Tesla, many other companies have decided to or are considering relocating to the area, which only means more growth, both in terms of population and local economy.

The construction of this model paves the way for creating a functional prototype for the cadre of interested investors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\n\n\"It's a stroke of genius,\" said Herns Louis, Eco-Motive USA Founder and CEO. \"Now that we have a model of the H-Motor built to scale, we can accelerate our development. The model will be used to test compatibility with multiple vehicles and used as a tangible representation for the investors and OEMs clamoring for more information about our design.\"\n\nLouis, whose extensive experience is in parts manufacturing, completed the model engine through a new style of hybrid manufacturing. The model was created partially through the traditional process as to etch out a variety of pieces. The other individual components were fabricated through advanced 3D printing technologies. This same process is being used by automotive manufacturers like Audi, Ford, Honda and Nissan.\n\n\"We're entering a new 'golden age' that makes improving vehicle efficiency and performance exponentially easier, which is the purpose of my dual fuel H-Motor,\" said Louis. \"Oil and gasoline have been the standard fuel for vehicles for decades, but with new technology comes change. That is why I firmly believe in this dual fuel design and I'm confident that others will appreciate its benefits.\"\n\nA functional prototype is predicted to be completed this year. While the prototype is under construction, Eco-Motive USA plans to use the current engine model to secure funding from interested investors and move strategic partnerships forward with OEM's.\n\nFor additional information about the H-Motor or potential investment opportunities, contact Herns Louis at (951) 970-8471 or herns.louis@gmail.com.

While there's a lot of appeal in the idea, it faces a daunting, maybe impossible gauntlet of energy companies, utilities and just plain inertia that could unplug the Tesla Home before it ever gets turned on.\n\nGreen Batteries\n\nMusk announced the home battery project during the Tesla Motors earnings call Wednesday evening. The consumer battery pack he described has already been designed and could start production in as little as six months. Questions of whether the announcement was meant to distract from a shortfall in car shipments this quarter aside, the battery does sound amazing. Getting rid of an electric bill automatically attracts interest.\n\n\"We are trying to figure out what would be a cool stationary (battery) pack,\" Musk said, according to a report in Forbes. \"Some will be like the Model S pack: something flat, 5 inches off the wall, wall-mounted, with a beautiful cover, an integrated bi-directional inverter, and plug and play.\"\n\nAnd of course Tesla is already building an enormous \"gigafactory\" in Nevada to produce its lithium-ion batteries at a larger scale, so technologically it all sounds very reasonable. Working with SolarCity (of which Musk is Chairman) to power the batteries with solar energy just makes the whole endeavor sound like a fantastically Earth-friendly project.\n\n(Energy) Storage Wars\n\nSaying that there's a lot of money in the energy and utility industry is like saying that the ocean is a bit damp, but it's a fact worth repeating when Musk and the Tesla team talk about making it easy to minimize or even eliminate reliance on the electric grid. That's a century-old industry with a lot of fingers in a lot of pies, and it has a lot invested in the current system. Even the most optimistic thinker would have to concede that convincing them to change would be hard, no matter how much of a benefit it would be in the long run.\n\nUnregulated batteries to power homes attached to solar panels that keep the battery charged mean some annoyed executives at utilities, especially if the battery's storage is large enough that it wouldn't even need much in the way of the electric grid to supplement the solar panels. Not that you'll ever hear it spelled out so bluntly. Tesla has said that utilities are partners, not enemies, but arguably that just depends on where you look.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, has a lot of state and local incentives for renewable power and electric cars. Other places in the U.S. have faced sometimes shockingly direct attacks on renewable energy, often through lawmakers urged on by energy industry lobbyists. Legislative attacks on solar power usually take the form of extra taxes on people using them, eliminating the economic value of relying less on the grid, even when that makes no sense. Oklahoma, Arizona and even the actual Sunshine State, Florida, have implemented or at least contemplated these kinds of solar disincentives.\n\nPeople Power\n\nIf there's any sort of accommodation to be found between Tesla's plan to offer cheap energy collection and storage and the current utility system, it's not very obvious. Some utility companies don't seem to like the idea of customers going on and off the grid as they need and have started adding fees for every connection. The problem with that plan is that it would only make a solar-enthusiast want to jump off the grid entirely if he or she can.\n\nThere's always hope that the companies and industries resisting the renewable energy and cheap battery storage represented by Tesla can change, but it won't happen quickly, if at all. It will take an overwhelming demand from people who want cheap and clean power. Luckily, it sounds like Tesla will have energy to spare.", "Apple has hired the former top U.S. executive of Mercedes-Benz's research and development arm, the Financial Times reported, further fueling rumors that the company has plans for automotive products.\n\nJohann Jungwirth has joined the Cupertino computing giant as its director of Mac systems engineering, a move confirmed on his LinkedIn profile.

The move follows similar widely publicised actions taken by Tesla Motors and Toyota in recent months.\n\nAccording to the Korea Times, LG companies will share 29,000 patents primarily with SMEs in the biotechnology, energy and cosmetics industries - though it is not clear precisely what 'share' means in this context. Furthermore, 3,058 patents will be made \"freely available\" to venture capital (VC) firms and their portfolio companies.\n\nLG will also station some of its IP experts at the newly opened Chungbuk Creative Economy Innovation Center in Cheongju to assist companies and investors to leverage the patents in question, develop new business models and create product and service lines.\n\nJuSeong Ryu, senior manager in the Intellectual Property Center at LG Electronics, told IAM that despite the three key markets mentioned above, the programme is aimed at SMEs and VC firms across all industries which might have uses for the technologies the patents relate to. \"The technology areas covered include not only energy, beauty and bio, but also electronics, display, chemicals and others,\" he said. \"In terms of jurisdictional coverage, there are Korean and US patents, as well as German and French assets and issued patents from other countries too.\"\n\nThe smaller set of 3,000-plus patents that are 'freely available' will be licensed on a royalty-free basis, Ryu told me. \"LG wants to build up the Korean SME ecosystem through use of our patents,\" he added. \"We believe that by opening up our patents we can help SMEs to build new businesses and engage in R&D.\"\n\nTesla Motors also 'opened' up its portfolio back in June when it made a commitment not to sue third parties that practiced on its patents; while last month, Toyota offered to license almost 6,000 of its patents relating to fuel cell vehicle technology royalty free. In both cases, these actions were aimed in part at accelerating R&D in the wider automotive industry by granting other businesses access to the two companies' technologies, with the hope that this will create more mature markets for their own products in the future. The announcement of these programmes also provided the two companies with a fair amount of publicity.\n\nTo an extent, the same can be said of LG's decision. However, there is also a particularly Korean context to be aware of here. This is not the first open innovation programme of its sort in the country. LG itself has previously transferred or licensed patents for free or at a cut price to domestic SMEs. Moreover, other major chaebol have also launched research centres and incubators in the country coupled with access to parts of their patent portfolios; back in November, for example, SK Group revealed its plans to expand its collaborative efforts nationwide after opening innovation centres in Daejeon and Sejong.\n\nSouth Korea's national ledger runs a substantial deficit when it comes to IP, with its balance of payments for 'use of intellectual property' standing at -US$52.2 billion for 2014. This is despite the fact that it spends more on R&D than any other country. It would seem that a large part of this is down to a status quo where Korea's largest companies invest huge sums in filing massive numbers of patents, acquiring them from third parties and licensing them in, but are relatively inactive when it comes to monetising their homegrown IP assets. Samsung Electronics alone spent over US$898 million on licence fees between January and September last year. South Korea's politicians have recognised this, and boosting innovation in the country's start-up ecosystem is seen as a key part of the solution.\n\nThe chaebol that have dominated the Korean marketplace for decades clearly have a major role to play in this regard; and they themselves have much to gain by engaging in open innovation with SMEs. The smaller companies gain cut-price access to intellectual property they can utilise to grow their businesses. The conglomerates get to put some of the non-core patents that are languishing in their sizeable portfolios - and are costing them money to maintain - to good use. At the same time, they get a sneak-peak at potential acquisition targets for the future. Anything that promotes growth - while reducing the country's IP deficit - can only be positive for Korea.", "Apple Inc. is in the process of hiring automotive technology experts, set to work out of the company's secret facility in Cupertino, Calif. to potentially develop a car, according to a report from The Financial Times.\n\n12 must-see cars at the Canadian International Auto Show\n\nIf you only have time to see 12 cars at this week's auto show in Toronto, these cars are your best bet -- and check out full coverage of the Canadian International Auto Show here\n\nIndustry experts have been speculating Apple has been exploring the medical and automotive industry as a growth area for the company for some time now, as revenue from iPad products continues to dip. Mercedes-Benz's head of research and development is reportedly the most recent addition to Apple's new automotive-focused team.\n\nAdrian Percia, Apple's head of mergers and acquisitions, reportedly met with Tesla Motors Inc. last year, which sparked speculation that the company may have considered acquiring the Model S electric car manufacturer, founded by billionaire Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal is reporting Apple's rumoured car project is called \"Project Titan,\" and that its current version \"resembles a minivan.\"\n\nOther industry speculation indicates Apple could be moving into the medical field, launching devices that have the ability to predict heart attacks. Apple's upcoming Apple Watch has various medical capabilities, ranging from monitoring user's heart rates to tracking movement, but isn't set to launch until later this year.\n\nRelated\n\nIn the past two years Apple's main rival, Google Inc., purchased thermostat manufacturer Nest Labs for US$3.2-billion, as well as robot maker Boston Dynamics and DeepMind Technologies Ltd. Self-driving cars have also long been on Google's radar, currently in development at the company's top-secret \"Google X\" facility.\n\nIn March last year, Apple revealed its new infotainment software dubbed CarPlay, allowing drivers to use much of the iPhone's functionality hands-free while driving a vehicle.\n\nApple, which like Google is trying to incorporate its software into cars, has recently tried to recruit from the automotive industry, two sources with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters.\n\nIn-car infotainment systems are often cited as potential areas of expansion for major technology companies. Google announced its Android Auto infotainment platform - which is set to compete against Apple's CarPlay - during this year's Consumer Electronics Show. BlackBerry's QNX platform controls everything from a vehicle's GPS to safety related features, and is seen as one of the struggling company's rare successes, currently commands more than half of the rapidly growing market for in-vehicle infotainment.\n\nApple has been trying to poach experts in fields such as robotics, according to Reuters' sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n\"Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay,\" an individual who worked closely with Apple for many years told Financial Times.\n\n\"Today I think it's a car.\"\n\nWith files from Reuters", "It was just a couple of sentences during Wednesday's 2014 earnings call by Tesla Motors executives.\n\nBut in it, CEO Elon Musk apparently revealed a new line of business for the company: selling or leasing lithium-ion battery packs for home energy storage.\n\nThe full quote can be found in the transcript of the earnings call, as published by Seeking Alpha.

I'm really excited about it.\n\nGreen Car Reports reached out to Tesla to confirm that Tesla Motors will be going into the business of providing battery packs to consumers for household energy storage.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Khobi Brooklyn, the company's director of global communications, reiterating Musk's promise of a product unveiling in a month or two.\n\nTesla already provides battery packs to Solar City, which leases solar panels and batteries to households to allow them to generate and store their own electricity--vastly reducing their electric bills in most cases.\n\nMusk is not only the chairman of that company, but also its largest shareholder.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the \"we\" in Musk's statement refers to Tesla Motors, or to Solar City, but the Tesla brand might give added cachet to lithium-ion batteries offered to homeowners who already have solar panels installed.\n\nThe prospect of affordable home energy storage, combined with the continually falling price of photovoltaic solar panels, is likely to change the energy landscape and the business model of established electric utilities quite dramatically over the next decade and beyond.\n\n\"Distributed renewables,\" as the concept is collectively known, could thus be installed by homeowners or their utilities on individual buildings--residential or commercial--or even neighborhoods.\n\nUtilities are also increasingly opening very large-scale solar farms in unpopulated areas to harvest hundreds of megawatts of solar electricity, and experimenting with batteries for energy storage to buffer the unpredictable supply and store energy for peak demand periods.\n\nTesla itself has said it plans to use solar energy to provide electricity for its Supercharger DC fast-charging stations; it recently installed solar panels at its first such site in Barstow, California.\n\nBut while the quantity of electricity that is centrally generated in large power plants and then sold to individual consumers may ebb, utilities will still have to absorb the costs of maintaining the distribution grid and some generating capacity as a backup.\n\nThis has led some utilities to worry that if state regulators do not allow those costs to be separately billed from the fees for the electricity consumed, they face a \"landline problem.\"\n\nThat is, their most affluent customers will switch over time to a different way of obtaining energy and no longer absorb their proportional cost of grid maintenance.\n\nNonetheless, the lithium-ion cells produced in great volumes for electric cars will likely have many side effects--some of them unpredictable.\n\nNow it appears that battery packs for home energy storage branded with the name of the Silicon Valley upstart electric-car maker will be one of those side effects.", "Apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab, it has been claimed.\n\nSpeculation was rife last week when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras.\n\n'Dozens of Apple employees, led by experienced managers from its iPhone unit, are researching automotive products at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside the company's Cupertino campus,' the FT claims it was told by sources close to Apple.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nIt says the Apple research lab was set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away.\n\nIt is believed Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive is overseeing the lab, and the Bentley owning designer is known to be a car enthusiast.\n\nThe FT says one of its sources initially believe the project was Apple's in-car entertainment system, known as CarPlay - but now believes it is something more.\n\n'Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay.

I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.'\n\nAlternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software.\n\nThe Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco.\n\nThe blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer.\n\nBut a video from last year shows a similar car, which later transpired to be an unmarked self-driving Dodge caravan.\n\nAccording to 9to5mac, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple.\n\nWith 12 cameras on top of the car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View.\n\n'Too many cameras,' said technology analyst Rob Enderle.\n\n'It has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle.'\n\nThis would further lend itself to the self-driving car theory.\n\n'Unfortunately for that theory, only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles, and Apple isn't one of them,' said 9to5mac.\n\n'This brings us back to a much more likely conclusion: Apple is preparing to take on Google's Street View with a similar offering in its own Maps software.'\n\nThey said it might feature as part of the iOS 9 upgrade due later this year, although it would likely begin only with select cities such as New York and San Francisco.\n\nThis would plug a noticeable hole in Apple Maps, which has been missing Street View-style images ever since Apple made it the default maps app for iPhones.", "A new secret division at Apple is said to be working on designing a car\n\nThe rumors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) building a car won't be going away anytime soon. For the third time in as many days, we're hearing that more sources claim the Cupertino-based tech giant has designs on the auto industry.\n\nAnd in order to build its car, Apple is apparently not only stealing employees from Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) but also from other luxury automakers, including Mercedes-Benz.\n\nTim Bradshaw of the Financial Times reports that Apple has been recruiting automotive experts to work in its \"new top-secret research lab.\" (Are there really any secrets in Silicon Valley? Really?) He cites several sources who are familiar with the copmany.\n\nAccording to Bradshaw's sources, managers from Apple's iPhone division are heading up the secret lab, in which employees are reportedly researching products for the automotive industry. The sources also said Sir Jony Ive's design team has been meeting regularly with executives from automotive companies in the last several months.\n\nAt some of those meetings, Apple management has attempted to hire some of the executives. One executive who did defect to Apple is the former chief of Mercedes-Benz's research and development team, which is located in Silicon Valley.\n\nBradshaw reports that Apple just started putting together the secret automotive lab in the fall around the time it unveiled the Apple Watch, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. As a result, he states it's possible that anything which comes out of the secret division could be years away from landing on the market.\n\nApple already offers its own infotainment system for cars, which is CarPlay. So it's always possible that the secret lab is focused on advancing that platform. However, Bradshaw's sources claim that the backgrounds and work experience of the automotive experts Apple has been hiring suggest that the company could indeed be working on an actual car. Among the company's hires are engineers who specialize in vehicle dynamics and automotive designers.\n\nIndeed building its own car may be a logical next step for Apple, which counts Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) among its competitors. Google has been working on a self-driving car for quite some time, so why shouldn't Apple work on a car too? Also Tesla's recent integration of controls for the Model S into the Apple Watch demonstrate how Apple could build a car as a natural extension of its iOS ecosystem.\n\nAs of this writing, shares of Apple were down 0.35% at $126.02 per share.", "Apple is recruiting experts in automotive technology and vehicle design to work at a new top-secret research lab, according to several people familiar with the company, pointing to ambitions that go beyond the dashboard.\n\nDozens of Apple employees, led by experienced managers from its iPhone unit, are researching automotive products at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside the company's Cupertino campus, the people said.\n\nSir Jonathan Ive's team of Apple designers has held regular meetings with automotive executives and creators in recent months, in some cases trying to hire them.

Apple often investigates a wide range of new product areas, some of which never get released.\n\nBolstered by the resurgent success of its iPhones, the company's ambition under chief executive Tim Cook is growing.\n\nIts closest rival, Google, has spent years developing an autonomous vehicle and carmakers from Tesla Motors to century-old Detroit brands are vying for Silicon Valley talent.

At a Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco this week, he said that CarPlay was one of three new technology platforms Apple launched last year that are \"key to our future\", alongside HealthKit and HomeKit.\n\n\"We've taken iOS and extended it into your car, into your home, into your health,\" Mr Cook said. \"All of these are really critical parts of your life and none of us want to have different platforms in different parts of our lives.\"\n\nApple already has a relationship with the car industry through a recent extension of its iPhone business. CarPlay was originally launched in 2013 as \"iOS in the Car\" and was built into a Ferrari, its first vehicle, last September. Apple partners who have committed to build CarPlay into their dashboards include Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen.\n\nThe technology allows iPhone services including Siri, Maps and iTunes music to be controlled through an in-car touchscreen. But the software runs within automakers' existing infotainment systems, leaving open the opportunity for Apple technology to be more deeply integrated into vehicles.\n\nEarlier this week Business Insider reported that it had received an email from someone claiming to be an Apple employee, which said that the iPhone maker's latest project would \"give Tesla a run for its money\".\n\nRead MoreApple has a new solar farm, and greens hate it", "It's the middle of February, which means we're in the midst of cabin fever season.

Well there's a story from there, too.)\n\nElon Musk, the vocal owner of Tesla Motors, has had some major hiccups in his attempts in selling his electric cars in China. Despite being his biggest market next to the U.S., Reuters has reported sales in China have been horrible for Tesla, and Musk is not pleased to say the least. How bad are the Tesla sales in China? Like 120-cars-were-sold-across-the-whole-country bad. Again, 120 cars were sold across the entire country of China. According to the article, Musk was hoping for sales in China to rival the sales in the U.S. \"as early as 2015.\" Musk is reacting appropriately it seems - he's threatened to fire overseas executives according to a leaked internal email. \"We have no choice in this regard. There is no way that we can afford to subsidize a region of any size in the long term without causing serious harm to the company,\" Musk said in the Reuters article. He has reason to be concerned: In 2014, the stock rose just under 48%, but dropped 7% mid-January after an \"unexpectedly weak\" fourth quarter, and then dipped another 0.5% last Tuesday.\n\nObesity and weight loss has been a prominent health issue in the U.S. for a while now, and with approximately 18% of children struggling with obesity, it's understandable why. Puerto Rico has had it even rougher, with over 28% of their children considered obese. How can the country curb this epidemic? Puerto Rican legislators are debating a bill that could help curb it, which includes taxing the parents of obese children up to $800. According to an article in The Korea Times, the controversial bill \"aims to improve children's well-being and help parents make healthier choices\" according to Sen. Gilberto Rodriguez.\n\nSo how would this fun-sized fat tax work? According to the article, the public school teachers of Puerto Rico would flag potential obesity cases, and then the Health Department would meet with the child's parents to determine whether the obesity is a result of bad eating habits or a medical condition. If the child agrees to a planned diet and exercise program, then he or she would be eligible for re-evaluation in six months. If the child still isn't meeting the state-determined standards, the parents can be fined in the range of $500 to $800. The bill hasn't passed yet, and it entered public hearings last Monday.\n\nSomething spooky - and tech-savvy - is happening in Austin, TX: An eight-year-old MacBook Pro went up for sale on eBay last week. It sent auction prices soaring because the laptop is allegedly haunted. According to the New York Daily News, roughly 130 bids have pushed the price over the $3,000 mark at the time the article was published last Wednesday. The seller, who goes by wfatzinger on his eBay listing, had a hilarious description of the item titled \"HAUNTED 2007 Apple Macbook 13.3\" (White) (VERY HAUNTED).\"\n\nHow does a laptop get haunted? That's a very good question that's explained in great detail by wfatzinger in the post:\n\n\"It's unclear just how this laptop came to be haunted, but I 90% bet it was the time I left it in a graveyard next to an abandoned mental hospital all night by accident.

A Tesla spokeswoman said the company is not sharing any additional information about the battery systems \"in the next couple of months.\"\n\nBut it would make sense for the battery to be some sort of partnership between Tesla and one of Musk's other ventures, SolarCity. Musk is chairman of the board for the solar-energy company and its largest shareholder.\n\nSolarCity already offers power-storage systems that can be used during outages, but not a battery designed to be used as a home's full-time primary power source.", "Bidness Etc analyzes if Tesla's bold move to prioritize expansion over short-term profitability is a good one for investors\n\nFor its fiscal fourth quarter, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported revenues and earnings that missed the Street's estimates by some margin. Net loss per share swelled to 86 cents, up from the net loss of 13 a cents a share posted in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company's bottom-line was drained by expansion initiatives linked with the global sales network as well as development costs for the upcoming electric Model X crossover. Full-year operating expenses in 2014 grew to $1.07 billion, while cash and cash equivalents dropped from $2.37 billion at the end of the third quarter to $1.91 billion by the end of the fourth.\n\nBut far from attempting to tug at the bottom-line, Tesla is actually aiming to expand even more aggressively this year, having set aside a record $1.5 billion for full-year capital expenditure (capex). Operating expenses are projected to jump another 50% this year, though Tesla says it will likely return some positive cash flow before the year ends.\n\nThe massive capex projections from Tesla even surpass the estimates of some of the most bullish analysts. Morgan Stanley's head of auto research, Adam Jonas, who last year called Tesla \"the world's most important car company,\" released a note following Tesla's dismal fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nThe note said Elon Musk clearly \"had pushed the insane button on his spending ambitions and the growth ambitions\" in 2015.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which has a Buy call for Tesla stock and expects it to hit $280, believes the company's aggressive spending underpins its efforts to expand -- a move critical for an automaker that sold a few more than 30,000 electric cars in 2014, compared to the millions of vehicle sales conducted by some of the larger mainstream automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).\n\nMr. Jonas sees the global electric vehicles market as a $10 trillion opportunity that Tesla is best positioned to capitalize on, although he said he \"cringed\" at Mr. Musk comparing Tesla's stock performance with Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:APPL), which recently surpassed $700 billion in market capitalization.\n\n\"If you take this year's revenue, around $6 billion or thereabout, and if we're able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 p/e [price-to-earnings-ratio], our market cap would be basically the same as Apple's is today,\" Mr. Musk said.\n\nThis year, Mr. Musk is hoping to sell 74% more (or 55,000 electric cars) around the world to boost Tesla's top-line. And that kind of growth can only be achieved if Tesla can aggressively ramp up production capacity and output while simultaneously reaching out to more customers around the world, moves that will strain liquidity for Tesla in the short-term.\n\nChina, for instance, is proving to be a difficult market for Tesla even though Elon Musk had projected deliveries in China to match US sales as early as this year.\n\nThe main hurdle to EV adoption in the country is the perception that there is a dearth of EV charging facilities, and while Tesla contests the problem arose more because of a botched plan of entry into the world's largest auto market, ground realities do suggest that Tesla needs a hockey stick ramp in installing EV charging facilities in the country -- and fast, too.", "Is Apple designing a car?

In some cases, they have tried to hire them.\n\nThe new report shifts rumors about a possible Apple car into high gear. With the automobile industry in a state of rapid transformation the likes of which have not been seen since Henry Ford cranked up his assembly line a century ago, the time is clearly right for truly innovative approaches to car designs and power sources.\n\nCould Apple be working on an actual vehicle rather than concentrating on bringing iOS to the car?\n\nWe already know Apple has designers in its Industrial Design group with deep experience making cars, and the company will soon start building a big research center on its new spaceship campus.\n\nSpeaking at a Goldman Sachs conference earlier this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the three technologies \"key to our future\" are HealthKit, HomeKit and CarPlay.\n\nBut according to the Times, Apple's ambitions go beyond mere navigation and infotainment.

Earlier this week, Business Insider said it got an email from an Apple employee (who BI confirmed), saying Apple would \"give Tesla a run for its money.\"", "On Wednesday, Tesla Motors' Chairman and CEO Elon Musk told investment analysts in a conference call that his company's stock market value would exceed that of Apple Inc. by 2025, if its projections of 50 percent annual growth would become a reality.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple's total market cap went beyond $700 billion for the first time in its history, making Apple the world's first $700 billion company, while Tesla Motors's market value doesn't exceeds $27 billion.\n\nMr. Musk gave analysts a lot of good news about his company's prospective. For example, Tesla is set to sale nearly 55,000 electric cars worldwide over this year, an increase from the 31,655 units shipped last year.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Musk hopes that sales would get boosted by the new Model 3 sedan, which is expected to be released by the second half of 2017, as well as by the Tesla's revolutionary home battery, which is currently under development and it could go into production within 6 months.\n\nThe home battery is a consumer battery that stores clean energy for home. Tesla is already negotiating with SolarCity to combine the battery with rooftop solar systems. The new battery will enhance the PV systems' capacity of storing and redistributing energy by maybe turning into utility industry's worst nightmare.\n\nMr. Musk also said that his company's yearly revenue could reach $6 billion this year, as compared with $3.2 billion in 2014.\n\nBut market watchers say that Mr. Musk may be over optimistic about his company's future. They say that it is hard to believe that Tesla will sell millions of cars in the next ten years, when in January it only sold 120 cars in China. But Mr. Musk replied that Tesla would fix the \"China issue\" and would be in a pretty good shape by the second half of the year.\n\nAnalysts have other issues to worry about when looking at Tesla. In the conference call, Tesla's CEO said that the operating expenses will escalate this year from the estimated $1.07 billion by 45 percent to 50 percent. But estimations aren't always accurate. Last year, the Q4 operating expenses were $336.5 million, nearly double than those in 2013.\n\nAlso, the Q4 clash flow was negative ($455.1 million). Tesla announced that it should return positive by the end of this year, while the company doesn't need to raise additional funds at the moment.\n\nOther grim news for Tesla include a flattening U.S. market with only 17,400 cars sold last year, and lower sales than predicted in the forth quarter.", "The dust around Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)' latest earnings report is beginning to settle after Wall Street sent the automaker's shares plunging amid price targets and downgrades from multiple firms. Even some of the analysts who have been the most bullish on Tesla are starting to see the cracks appear in the company's reputation.\n\nIn a report dated Feb. 12, Johnson warned investors about getting \"caught up with ambitious mid/long-term targets.\" He emphasized that if Tesla is having trouble hitting its near term targets, it will probably have trouble hitting its long term targets as well.\n\nIn their report dated Feb. 12, Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) (ETR:DBK) (FRA:DB) analyst Rod Lache and his team also said they're reducing their price target for Tesla, slashing it from $310 to $245 per share. However, they didn't abandon their long term view, instead reiterating that they're staying focused on the future in contrast to where Barclays analysts are looking.\n\nThey don't see Tesla's earnings miss as derailing their investment thesis, which assumes that EVs will \"achieve cost parity with Internal Combustion vehicles in the not too distant future.\"\n\nIn their report also dated Feb. 12, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) analyst Patrick Archambault and his team made similar comments about Tesla. They trimmed their price target a bit from $214 to $216 per share and maintained their Neutral rating on the stock. In order to upgrade Tesla to a Buy rating, they need to see more sales in China, \"a more conservative design approach to the Model 3'' and improvements in \"operating FCF that we estimate will be negative $1bn in 2015 before warehouse financing inflows.\"\n\nNot all Tesla bulls are dialing back their enthusiasm. One of the topics that came up on the EV manufacturer's earnings call was capital expenditures. CEO Elon Musk made a bold comment about Tesla's market capitalization being the same as what Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s is right now one day. That statement left Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas \"with nervous excitement.\"\n\nIn a report dated Feb. 12, Jonas and his team said Tesla pressed the \"insane button\" on capital expenditures, noting that Musk's comment means the automaker is aiming to be a \"much larger company\" than they previously expected. The Morgan Stanley team also took the opposite stance of the Barclays team in focusing on the long term rather than the near term.\n\nOf course big growth comes with big costs, which Jonas says is \"a delicate balance for the markets to consider.\" He said the pace of demand looks to be \"quite good\" despite challenging situations like weak sales in China, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and slowing international sales. The analyst points out that Tesla's customer deposit balance grew 14%, which was 80% higher than his estimate. As a result, he suggests there are \"a lot of wealthy people who still want what Tesla is selling.\"\n\nHowever, he calls the cost of supplying this demand \"eye-wateringly high,\" as Tesla intends to spend $1.5 billion on capital expenditures this year. That figure is almost double what he had been expecting and up by 50% compared to what the company spent in 2014. Operating expense projections are also nearly 40% higher, mostly due to expenses related to research and development.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Tesla burned through $86 million in cash, which was about what Jonas expected. However, he added that the automaker will probably burn through a lot more than the $40 million he had projected previously. He also said that Tesla's projected spending levels suggest management wants to hit at least 500,000 units by 2020 -- many more than the 295,000 he had been projecting.\n\n\"The assumptions in our earnings model seem to be at great philosophical odds with Tesla's much more ambitious growth aspirations,\" wrote the Morgan Stanley team. \"When thinking about the share price development, the key question we are left with is whether investor appetite can keep up with Tesla's growth journey and the alignment of forward looking expectations with the capital markets... a balance so important to firms at this early stage of development.\n\nAnalysts at Evercore Partners Inc. (NYSE:EVR) ISI and Ascendiant Capital Markets also remain bullish on Tesla. Evercore's price target is an astounding $320 a share right now, and they also focus on the long term potential of the EV manufacturer.\n\nAnalysts George Galliers and Arndt Ellinghorst see Tesla as being well-positioned in the EV industry for several reasons. For one, they say it's less exposed to risks in the market compared to peers. Additionally, they see \"no obvious competition\" for Tesla's cars, which has resulted in \"substantial brand equity.\"\n\nIn his follow-up report to Tesla's earnings, Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Theodore O'Neil pointed out that Tesla did not move back the production date for the Model X again. He also thinks concerns about competition are overblown, pointing out that while Tesla shared its patents with the world, it won't share details on the machinery it uses to assemble its battery packs because that's a \"trade secret.\" As a result, he believes the EV manufacturer remains about 10 years ahead of competitors in electric battery technology.\n\nAs of this writing, shares of Tesla Motors were up by 0.41% to $203.35 per share.", "New York - US stocks ended sharply higher on Thursday, with a rally in technology stocks leading the Nasdaq to a 15-year high, while a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine also eased tensions.\n\nThe day's gains were broad, with eight of the 10 primary S&P 500 sectors rising, and the S&P information technology sector rose 1.6 percent in its third straight daily advance.

Musk said:\n\nWe're going to unveil the Tesla home battery [indiscernible] consumer battery that will be for use in and [sic] people's houses or businesses, fairly soon. We have the design done and it should start going into production probably about six months or so.\n\nWe probably got a date to have sort of product unveiling, it's probably in the next month or two. It's really great. I'm really excited about it.\n\nGreen Car Reports reached out to Tesla to confirm that Tesla Motors will be going into the business of providing battery packs to consumers for household energy storage.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Khobi Brooklyn, the company's director of global communications, reiterating Musk's promise of a product unveiling in a month or two.\n\nTesla already provides battery packs to Solar City, which leases solar panels and batteries to households to allow them to generate and store their own electricity--vastly reducing their electric bills in most cases.\n\nMusk is not only the chairman of that company, but also its largest shareholder.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the \"we\" in Musk's statement refers to Tesla Motors, or to Solar City, but the Tesla brand might give added cachet to lithium-ion batteries offered to homeowners who already have solar panels installed.\n\nThe prospect of affordable home energy storage, combined with the continually falling price of photovoltaic solar panels, is likely to change the energy landscape and the business model of established electric utilities quite dramatically over the next decade and beyond.\n\n\"Distributed renewables,\" as the concept is collectively known, could thus be installed by homeowners or their utilities on individual buildings--residential or commercial--or even neighborhoods.\n\nUtilities are also increasingly opening very large-scale solar farms in unpopulated areas to harvest hundreds of megawatts of solar electricity, and experimenting with batteries for energy storage to buffer the unpredictable supply and store energy for peak demand periods.\n\nTesla itself has said it plans to use solar energy to provide electricity for its Supercharger DC fast-charging stations; it recently installed solar panels at its first such site in Barstow, California.\n\nBut while the quantity of electricity that is centrally generated in large power plants and then sold to individual consumers may ebb, utilities will still have to absorb the costs of maintaining the distribution grid and some generating capacity as a backup.\n\nThis has led some utilities to worry that if state regulators do not allow those costs to be separately billed from the fees for the electricity consumed, they face a \"landline problem.\"\n\nThat is, their most affluent customers will switch over time to a different way of obtaining energy and no longer absorb their proportional cost of grid maintenance.\n\nNonetheless, the lithium-ion cells produced in great volumes for electric cars will likely have many side effects--some of them unpredictable.\n\nNow it appears that battery packs for home energy storage branded with the name of the Silicon Valley upstart electric-car maker will be one of those side effects.", "Stocks were higher on Friday the 13th.

Ogg", "Elon Musk thinks that Tesla would be able to match Apple's current market cap by 2025\n\nDespite posting disappointing 4Q earnings on Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claims that one day the electric carmaker could match current market capitalization of tech giant Apple Inc. This means Tesla Motors will be worth more than $700 billion, as the Cupertino-based tech giant crossed that market last week.\n\nPessimism is not a word known to Elon Musk. When Wall Street analysts were going bearish on the stock following the poor 4Q financial results, Tesla raised its 2015 outlook. The automaker is even confident of reaching its target of selling 55,000 vehicles by the end of this year - a rise of 70% year-over-year (YoY) - even if China sales were zero.\n\nIt hard to understand what convinced Elon Musk to raise the company's future outlook by this large of a margin. However, one cannot completely shun the ideas proposed by the visionary CEO, as he has a good track record of achieving his targets.\n\nThe company was able to produce 35,000 electric vehicles (EVs) last year when many Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) critics were skeptical. Elon Musk even successfully convinced the state government of Ohio and New York to sell Tesla EVs directly to customers, bypassing traditional dealership model. Also, the Tesla leader was also able to produce the fast EV car in the market. The Model S P85D can reach a speed of 60 mph from a stationary position in just 2.8 seconds.\n\nMr. Musk's next big plan is to be as big as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). At a conference call on Wednesday, Mr. Musk said:\n\n\"If you take this year's revenue, around $6 billion or thereabout, and if we're able to maintain a 50% growth rate for 10 years and achieve 10% profitability number and have a 20 p/e [price-to-earnings-ratio], our market cap would be basically the same as Apple's is today.\"\n\nQuartz has made some calculations to help us understand how achievable this objective is. The publication writes that in order to achieve an Apple like market cap, the EV manufacturer would need to rake in $350 billion revenue, using Mr. Musk's targeted 10% profit margin. Even if the company achieves P/E multiple of 20x, Tesla would need to make a profit of $35 billion.\n\nThe publication further mentions that the automaker will need to sell around 5.83 million vehicles annually by 2025, if average Tesla EV price is $60,000. However, this is a quite an optimistic target, as the US automaker only managed to sell about 35,000 EVs last year.\n\nEven achieving $350 billion revenue looks far off, with the automaker posting just $3.6 billion revenue from sales in 2014.\n\nIt is hard to say if Tesla could achieve such a high value in a decade, but surely the company is taking some aggressive steps to boost global operations.\n\nFor the year 2014, the total operation expense clocked in at $1.07 billion, which the company expects to grow 40-50% this year. This bullish stance was even noted by strong Tesla bull Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. He said: \"Tesla is preparing to be a much larger company than we have forecasted.\"\n\nFurthermore, the automaker is expanding its production scale to cover mass-market by releasing Model 3 in 2017. To achieve its high vehicle rollout target, Tesla is heavily investing in research and development. The Nevada Gigafactory is currently in construction phase, which according to Elon Musk will produce half a million battery packs by the end of this decade.\n\nTesla closed trading at $202.88 on Thursday, down 4.66%. The stock is currently trading at $203.11, up 0.15%, as of 12:12 pm EST.", "In the earnings call on Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company is ready to launch electric batteries to power houses in residential areas\n\nTesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a loss per share of $0.13 in its fourth quarter (4Q) of fiscal year 2014 (FY14) earnings call on Wednesday, missing earnings estimate by 44%. Revenues came out at $1.1 billion, below the Street's expectation of $1.2 billion.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk put forward his idea of manufacturing consumer batteries during the earnings call. This will be a new product line for the company. The designs are ready and mass production of the battery packs is expected to begin sometime in the next six months. The date for the official launch has not been announced as yet.\n\nMr. Musk seems to be optimistic about the product. He stated during the call: \"We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people's houses or businesses fairly soon.\"\n\nThe CEO announced plans to manufacture batteries last year. However, the design of the batteries has not yet been disclosed, and the shape of the pack is also unknown. Mr. Musk stated: \"We are trying to figure out what would be a cool stationary (battery) pack,\" and, \"It will be like the Model S pack: something flat, 5 inches off the wall, wall-mounted, with a beautiful cover, an integrated bi-directional inverter, plug and play.\"\n\nTesla is expected to face competition from Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM) in this market segment. Toyota Mirai, which uses a hydrogen battery, can also be used by consumers to charge the batteries at home.\n\nHaving batteries in residential areas will allow consumers to reduce their electricity expenses and bills.\n\nTesla Chief Technical Officer, JB Straubel, stated that there will be an event in a \"month or two\" in which plans for the product will officially be released. He said: \"It's really great. I'm really excited about it.\"\n\nThe CTO believes that the product is going to be a huge success in the future. He stated: \"The long-term demand for stationary energy storage is extraordinary,\" and, \"We've done a huge amount of effort there and have talked to major utilities and energy service companies.\"\n\nThe automaker believes that the product will have long-term demand. However, investors and analysts have been thrashing it for significantly increasing its capital expenditure.", "The Disruptive Discoveries Journal is a free weekly newsletter focused uncovering and interpreting both the opportunities and challenges in the natural resources, agriculture, biotech, and technology sectors resulting from the belief mentioned above.\n\nTesla Motors (TSLA:NASDAQ) released Q4 and 2014 full year earnings last night and the results were disappointing. The company missed expectations on just about every conceivable metric one would use to judge success including earnings, deliveries, and revenues. Although disappointing, TSLA should still likely be viewed through a longer-term lens than its competitors as the company is still arguably in its early growth phase and isn't yet a mature operating entity.\n\nWhile the numbers we all tend to focus on were down, what was perhaps more notable were the statements made by Mr. Musk and his team on the call. They include:\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Musks' statement that within ten years TSLA could have a market cap that equaled that of Apple Inc. (AAPL:NASDAQ). AAPL's current market cap of US $740 billion would give TSLA a share price of approximately $5,920 per share based on TSLA's current share count. When was the last time you heard of a company selling what is effectively a commodity (cars) with that sort of valuation and share price?\n\n\u00b7 The company plans to spend a \"staggering\" amount going forward on capital expenditure and actually forecast spending $1.5 billion in cap ex in 2015 - roughly 50% higher than analysts had estimated. With $1.9 billion in cash on the balance sheet, how will this cap ex be financed? What is the dilution strategy? That level of detail was not addressed.\n\n\u00b7 Musk stated he has a \"secret weapon\" to ignite demand if it flags in 2015. After listening to past conference calls with the company, I understood the company to not have any issues with demand. All issues were supply-related. Has something changed?\n\n\u00b7 Finally, the company expects to be cash flow positive AFTER cap ex in 2015. This was a surprise, as in 2014 TSLA generated negative $1 billion in free cash flow and spent just under $1 billion on cap ex last year. Again, this is set to rise by 50% in 2015, so it is imperative that the company hit its 2015 sales target for Model S and X cars of 55,000. For those unaware, free cash flow is calculated by taking cash flow from operations and subtracting cap ex. Many people believe that free cash flow does a better job of demonstrating a company's ability to generate cash relative to gauging this through earnings.\n\nOther concerns include foreign exchange movements (the USD is up 7% versus the EUR in 2015), competition (BMW and Mercedes are but two of an increasing number of competitors), the sales strategy in China, and the general inability to test drive TSLA's cars (would you buy a thoroughbred horse without thoroughly vetting it first?).\n\nGiven the concerns above, I think it's important to remember that all early stage companies run into growing pains. TSLA's product is unique and I would agree when people say there's nothing like it out there. The financials of any company are of utmost importance, but in TSLA's case it's more important to see the trends in spending, revenues, cash flows, etc rather than the absolute numbers. TSLA's cars aren't (yet) commodities, and low gas prices won't hurt them, though this could come into play later in 2017 when the mass market Gen III model is forecast to be released. The real key in thinking about TSLA is separating the high flying share price from the potential of the actual business.\n\nHowever, I still believe that TSLA hasn't yet faced its biggest challenge - specifically securing enough raw materials to satisfy future growth targets. TSLA's audacious plans are well known, but adding growth plans of other major automotive and battery manufacturers together puts forth the possibility of challenges in procuring a reliable source of raw materials. To be clear, I'm not forecasting shortages, but this thinking is why I'm optimistic on the prospects for lithium and cobalt over the next few years. I actually expect to see recycling become more prevalent here.\n\nThis issue was briefly (and unsatisfactorily) addressed on the call with management saying they are \"pleased\" with battery supply chain discovery but weren't prepared to make any commitments on supply chain announcements. You're planning on doubling the global capacity of lithium ion batteries by 2020 and you're \"pleased\" with what you've found out? More detail is necessary here. One would assume 2015 will be the year we learn more about solutions to this issue.\n\nVehicle electrification is here to stay and it is an exciting time to be involved in the space. Just how relevant TSLA remains in this increasingly competitive field is anyone's guess. They offer the best product at the highest price - a fact that their financials obscure somewhat. The stock was arguably overdue for a re-rating and how TSLA achieves its goals this year and going forward will determine the company's stature in the automotive sector in the future. Until then, I await answers to some of the questions posed above.", "It's been five years since a Cessna piloted by Tesla Motors employee Douglas Bourn crashed into an East Palo Alto neighborhood, and it has taken nearly that long for all of the litigation to resolve against Bourn's estate and Tesla Motors. In that time, East Palo Alto families have tried to rebuild their lives and their homes, and relatives of the two plane passengers killed, Brian Finn and Andrew Ingram, have received some compensation for their loved ones' deaths.\n\nSettlements and community fundraising have brought some measure of closure to people's lives. But steps have yet to be taken to ensure that such a crash by pilots flying out of Palo Alto Municipal Airport never happens again.\n\nCourt records show that the victims of the Feb. 17, 2010, disaster received compensation, but the settlement terms are not known.\n\nPaula and Barbara Ingram, Andrew Ingram's parents, filed suit in San Mateo County Superior Court against Bourn and his company, Air Unique, on Aug. 17, 2010, for unspecified damages. Their suit was settled in February 2013 for an undisclosed sum.\n\nFinn's wife, Sherina Yuk Chan, and their young child, Erin Silei Finn, filed suit against Air Unique on Jan. 10, 2011. That suit settled in December 2012, according to court documents.\n\nLisa Jones, whose home was completely destroyed after the plane struck the roof and started a fire, struggled with homelessness and lived with friends after she lost her daycare business that she operated out of the house. She and six family members filed suit against Bourn's estate on Nov. 22, 2010, and settled on Aug. 12, 2013, for an undisclosed sum, but the settlement was not adequate to rebuild her home, she later said.\n\nAtherton residents stepped in to raise money to rebuild Jones' home with the help of the nonprofit Rebuilding Together. Jones returned to her home in September, the last victim to return to the neighborhood.\n\nBeech Street residents Ervin and Pinkie Hudleton, whose vehicle and carport were destroyed by parts of the disintegrating plane, filed a lawsuit on Feb. 16, 2012, against Bourn, Air Unique, Tesla, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, Palo Alto Airport and Pacific Gas & Electric. Their litigation settled in August 2012.\n\nFive family members living at the home of Jose Cortes-Herrera, whose house, belongings and vehicles were damaged by fire from the crash and explosion, filed suit in San Mateo County in 2010 against Air Unique, Tesla Motors and Bourn's estate. Most of the victims settled in December 2013, but two family members disputed the sum and were awarded $10,000 each on Aug. 4, 2014, according to court documents.\n\nAs memories fade and lives move on, Palo Alto Airport and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which determines flight paths and rules for airports and aircraft, continue to point to pilot error as the reason for the crash. National Transportation Safety Board investigators did determine that Bourn took off in heavy fog conditions and did not obey the approved flight route, which instructed him to bank to the right over the San Francisco Bay. For an unknown reason, Bourn banked left after takeoff and at a lower elevation, striking a utility tower before crashing into the Beech Street homes.\n\n\"Once flight clearance has been obtained, no pilot may deviate from that clearance unless an amended clearance is obtained, an emergency exists, or the deviation is in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory,\" FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said in an email this week.\n\nThe FAA doesn't close airports due to weather conditions, but an airport could choose to close a runway if it is damaged or if an aircraft is disabled on the runway. But flying in bad weather is a pilot's risk, Gregor said.\n\nThe FAA has not had any discussions with East Palo Alto or Palo Alto officials regarding a change in procedures or flight patterns, Gregor said.\n\nPalo Alto City Manager James Keene said that following the plane crash city officials had extensive conversations with East Palo Alto, primarily around emergency response, communication and coordination.\n\n\"At that time, the airport was a county operation. Now that the city has taken over the airport, we expect working together with our neighbors regarding the airport -- operations and planning -- will be the standard,\" he said.\n\nCity Council member Pat Burt, who was mayor in 2010 when the crash occurred, said the city's takeover of the airport could involve stronger education programs for pilots.\n\nRalph Britton, Palo Alto Airport Association president, said the association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association held a seminar for pilots at Cubberley Auditorium on Sept. 20, 2010, to discuss safety operating procedures and the risks associated with low-visibility departures.\n\n\"The Palo Alto Airport Association regularly reminds pilots to be mindful of East Palo Alto's proximity to the airport and follow procedures which will minimize noise impact to the community. The memory of this tragedy continues to weigh heavily on the airport community,\" he added.\n\nEast Palo Alto Interim Manager Carlos Martinez, City Councilman Ruben Abrica and former mayor David Woods, who were involved in the city at the time of the crash, did not return requests for comment.", "On the foggy morning of Feb. 17, 2010, Palo Alto plunged into darkness at the beginning of the morning commute.

But steps have yet to be taken to ensure that such a crash by pilots flying out of Palo Alto Municipal Airport never happens again.\n\nCourt records show that the victims of the Feb. 17, 2010, disaster received compensation, but the settlement terms are not known.\n\nPaula and Barbara Ingram, Andrew Ingram's parents, filed suit in San Mateo County Superior Court against Bourn and his company, Air Unique, on Aug. 17, 2010, for unspecified damages.

National Transportation Safety Board investigators did determine that Bourn took off in heavy fog conditions and did not obey the approved flight route, which instructed him to bank to the right over the San Francisco Bay. For an unknown reason, Bourn banked left after takeoff and at a lower elevation, striking a utility tower before crashing into the Beech Street homes.\n\n\"Once flight clearance has been obtained, no pilot may deviate from that clearance unless an amended clearance is obtained, an emergency exists, or the deviation is in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory,\" FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said in an email this week.\n\nThe FAA doesn't close airports due to weather conditions, but an airport could choose to close a runway if it is damaged or if an aircraft is disabled on the runway.

It needs to cure whatever ails it in China, a market that will become increasingly vital for its success. And it needs to show a clear path to profitability in the next 12 to 18 months. Otherwise shares might fall to a level that make the electric car company a tantalizing acquisition target, Brauer said.\n\n\"In 2015 there's going to be no getting away from these big rocks he's got to move,\" he said of CEO Elon Musk. \"We're starting to hit an inflection point where things kind of have to go really well and if any one of them unravels, everything does.\"\n\nBy Musk's account, things are going better than most people think. By its own accounting measures, it has ended the last two years profitably and \"the China thing has been blown way out of proportion.\" Demand for Teslas is so high that it doesn't matter if the company faces sales bumps in the road in China -- it can just sell those cars in other places in the world with long waiting lists for the vehicles.\n\nBrauer sees it a little differently. Earnings and revenue displayed under generally accepted accounting principals (which the government mandates companies show along with its own non-GAAAP account of its finances) will show that Tesla hasn't had a profitable year in its decade-long history. And deep waitlists or not, as Tesla expands production (it's supposed to go from 33,000 to 55,000 in 2015), it's going to need to sell cars in China.\n\nWhile analysts on the earnings call queried Musk about China, a more immediate concern is the Model X SUV.\n\nTesla said in its shareholder letter released with earnings yesterday that it would release the Model X in the third quarter of this year, after several delays related to the engineering of some of its sleek features like gullwing doors that open upward, DeLorean style. Musk said all the Model X cars Tesla will build this year have already been ordered. But the car was originally supposed to be released early this year.\n\n\"The Model S had this air of uniqueness and singularity, but there's enough interest in SUVs right now that even if it's not really unique technologically, it's an all-electric SUV and they're loved right now,\" Brauer said.\n\nBut Tesla's true money-making venture, the vehicle that's supposed to get them to full profitability, is the more-affordable, mass market Model 3. Delays in production of the SUV mean delays in the production of the more affordable model. That in turn shrinks the time window during which an affordable, 200-mile-range electric car from Tesla doesn't have to compete with more models from other, bigger automakers. If companies like GM can get a long-range, affordable car on the market before Tesla does, it's going to have trouble competing in the long term.\n\nBut in the short-term, its fourth quarter's delivery numbers barely missed the mark, even if Tesla did have to work feverishly to produce enough cars in time.\n\nRevenue and profit fell short in the fourth quarter and Musk said Tesla will spend $1.5 billion, \"a staggering amount,\" on capital expenditures in 2015. But that's not that surprising for a company that's preparing to release two new vehicle lines, ramp production up exponentially, and build a multi-billion dollar battery plant, the likes of which has never been built before.\n\nStill, the stakes in the game are getting higher and 2015 may well be the year that we find out whether Musk's gambles will pay off.\n\nShares of Tesla Motors closed Thursday down 4.7 percent.\n\nGet the business scoops you need to start the day with our free Morning Edition email.\n\nEric Van Susteren is the Digital Producer at the Silicon Valley Business Journal.", "There's been a lot of squawking about Tesla Motors Inc.'s big fourth quarter earnings miss, but so far investors have stayed relatively stalwart.\n\nDespite missing its own car-delivery target, falling short on revenue and reporting a loss when analysts expected a profit, shares are down only about 5 percent -- a relatively normal occurrence in the notoriously volatile stock.\n\nThis year, Tesla might not have that luxury; 2015 may well be the year that defines the electric car maker, said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelly Blue Book.\n\nHe said Tesla needs a flawless launch of its upcoming model, the Model X, which hopefully doesn't bite too deeply into Model S sales.\n\nIt needs to cure whatever ails it in China, a market that will become increasingly vital for its success.

(He has quite a stable.) As a teenager, Ive wanted to be a car designer. He visited a U.K. design school that specialized in automotives with a view to studying there, but he found the other students too weird. They were making \"vroom vroom\" noises as they sketched. Instead, he went to Newcastle Polytechnic (which has since been renamed Northumbria University).\n\nA look at other key members of Apple's design team, and at a super-secret research-and-development facility planned for the company's new campus, offers a few clues about how Cupertino might go about producing innovative and unconventional cars.\n\nApple's possible interest in automotive innovation comes at a time of accelerating change for the transportation industry. From electric cars and high-mileage hybrids to autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing ventures, the way we move around the planet is undergoing rapid and radical transformation.\n\nConsumer electronics companies like Apple bring expertise in software interfaces, navigation and entertainment -- as well as in building battery-powered hardware -- to the innovation party, and could be well-placed to disrupt this traditionally conservative industry.\n\nThe fact that key Apple designers possess a deep and abiding fascination with automobiles, or that the company is hiring experts away from Tesla and BMW, does not confirm that Cupertino is working on an iCar. Nor does the spotting of mysterious Apple vans decked out with cameras and sensors.\n\nPerhaps Apple's automotive dreams begin and end with CarPlay, its platform for deeply integrating iOS into the in-car ecosystem. However, there was a time when nobody thought a underdog computer company based in Cupertino would get into the mobile phone game, and we all know how that turned out.\n\nHere's a look at some of the in-house expertise Apple could bring to bear if it were, in fact, working on transforming the automotive industry with an Apple car.\n\nApple's latest celebrity hire, designer Mark Newson, crafted a concept car for Ford. Mostly a styling exercise, the Ford O21C debuted at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show in bright orange (the car's named after the Pantone color).\n\nNewson's O21C featured suicide doors and a weird trunk that slid out like a drawer. All four seats swiveled on pedestals. The single-spoke steering wheel was reminiscent of a Newson coat-hanger design, and the entire ceiling lit up with an electro-luminescent glow.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the controls were different from anything at the time; something Apple will likely bring to the table if it gets into cars. The dials looked like one of Newson's Ikepod watches, and the button layout was unusual for a 1999 car. All the controls were presented in a long row of simple push-buttons with Apple-like icons.\n\nApple's secretive Industrial Design Group (IDg), which numbers about 20 members (no outsiders know for certain), includes Julian H\u00f6nig, a former car designer with Lamborghini and Audi.\n\nA native of Austria, H\u00f6nig did post-grad work at the Art Center College of Design, a leading automotive design school in Pasadena, California.\n\nH\u00f6nig did design work for several years at Lamborghini and Audi. At Audi, he designed the exteriors of the Audi Q3 crossover, the Audi A4 Avant and the Audi A4 Limousine. H\u00f6nig joined Apple in 2010, and is named in 118 patents awarded to Apple, according to a patent database search.\n\nH\u00f6nig also designed the Audi RSQ, a concept car designed as product placement in the absolutely dreadful 2004 sci-fi film I, Robot. Although it was supposed to represent a car from 2035, H\u00f6nig had to make it look like a recognizable Audi, so the concept got compromised.\n\nAnother member of Apple's Industrial Design Group, Aaron Von Minden, worked with BMW's famous Designworks group. While there, he worked on BMW's crazy Gina concept car and many other projects, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nGina is a fabric-covered car that can shift its shape depending on driving conditions and speed. Gina stands for \"Geometry and functions In 'N' Adaptations.\" Gina's construction is bizarre, featuring an articulated aluminum skeleton covered in a stretchy, polyurethane-coated Spandex skin.\n\nUnder the fabric, tiny motors pull the skin back to change the car's shape or reveal openings. It's \"eyelids,\" for example, open to reveal the headlamps. The engine is accessed via a zipper-like opening on the hood. Here it is in action:\n\nIt's unlikely Apple would get into shape-shifting cars, but it seems like the kind of project that would catch Jony Ive's attention.\n\nApple reportedly has been trying to poach employees from Tesla Motors, but searches on LinkedIn suggest the electric car company has hired three or four times more employees from Apple than the other way around. Tesla's hires include high-profile employees like UI designer Brennan Boblett and Doug Field, who, according to a Tesla press release, \"has been Apple's VP of Product Design since 2007 and works closely with Jony Ive.\"\n\nIn Apple's case, the company seems to have hired a handful of technical recruiters from Tesla -- not engineers or automotive software experts, as some reports have suggested. If Cupertino is looking for motoring talent to create an Apple car, it seems to be in the very early stages.\n\nUsually when Apple is seriously gearing up for major new product categories -- like the upcoming Apple Watch -- it hires senior people with requisite expertise, like Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry CEOs Paul Deneve and Angela Ahrendts (fashion), Jay Blahnik (fitness) and Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine (music/entertainment).\n\nIf an innovative and futuristic Apple Car is indeed one of the products in Tim Cook's magic pipeline, where would development take place? How about inside a high-security research-and-development facility shrouded in peek-proof glass?\n\nApple plans to build a massive R&D facility at its new spaceship headquarters, Campus 2. Called Phase 2, the R&D complex is scheduled to get started after the main campus building is completed in 2016. The planned 600,000-square-foot research center will house 2,200 employees.\n\nIt includes a four-story, glass-encased office building and a similarly sized R&D facility. The R&D building will be encased in frosted glass to keep whatever goes on inside top secret. In fact, the whole complex is separated from the main building to restrict access and keep activities hidden from outside eyes, according to plans submitted to the city of Cupertino.\n\nThe complex is far larger than Apple's current R&D facilities at One Infinite Loop, although Apple might conduct research elsewhere (and in fact, likely does). Still, the planned R&D facility seems much bigger than what would be necessary for testing iPhones and iPads. There's apparently no racetrack, though.", "Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s stock had its \"buy\" rating reiterated by analysts at Deutsche Bank in a research report issued to clients and investors on Thursday.

Unfortunately, he is to busy with Tesla Motors and the Space X project to build that, but a new group took the concept and plans to make it real.\n\nThe new company, known as Hyperloop Technologies, isn't your average Kickstarter startup. They have their own landing page and among the team members you can cont on former Space X engieer Brogan BamBrogan, X-Prize founder Peter Diamandis, 2012 Barack Obama re-election campaign manager Jim Messina and VC impresario Shervin Pishevar.\n\nThe team managed to raise around $8.5 million (\u20ac7.4 million), planning to reach $80 million (\u20ac70.2 million) by the end of 2015 and at least start working on a small scale test track to assess the technology.\n\nAccording to a Forbes report, a possible test track for the real Hyperloop is the space between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, since the two areas are wealthy and have a regular traffic in between. Tests will be done using freight at first, not to endanger people's lives in case something goes awfully wrong.\n\nHow's tubular transportation going to work?\n\nIn case you're new to the idea (despite having been proposed since the 1800's) the whole thing relies on a very long tube and capsules traveling inside at very fast speeds. The first ideas were to push the capsules via air, but the longer the tube goes, the more inefficient the method is due to air friction.\n\nTaking out all the air out of the tube to eliminate friction is also a bad idea because the tiniest crack will compromise the whole system. The only way is to leave some air inside, at a pressure much lower than 1 atm (14.7 psi). Still, having this inside the tube will turn the capsule into a piston at a certain speed, which will have to push all the air forward.\n\nAnd here comes the Hyperloop idea. Put a huge electric compressor at the front of the capsule to draw all the air in front and spew it out the back. This will allow for a very narrow tunnel and tremendous speeds, reaching more than 700 mph (1,126 km/h).\n\nThe same compressor will blow a part of the air downwards to create an air cushion, perfect for sliding on at those speeds, while most of the go-forward power will be assured by linear electric motors, similar to what the Japanese Maglev train uses.\n\nThe tube should be mounted on pillars to eliminate the need to buy long strips of land from farmers and whatnot, and the engineers have even thought how to compensate for earthquakes and expansion/shrinkage phenomena caused by temperature variations. But you can read more about the whole project in Musk's original Hyperloop project here.\n\nSound like supersonic traveling might come back after we were deprived of the Concorde flights. We can only wish the company good luck and hope for the best.", "\"Can you self drive?\" That's auto industry's future question to ask. We have no doubt about it. Google, Tesla Motors and some of the giant automakers are already investing millions, heck even NASA jumped on the bandwagon. The latest to join the autonomous car research game? University of Oxford.\n\nThe name? Wildcat. The purpose? Well... money. Oh, and road safety. And a future with no traffic congestion. Here's how everything happened.\n\nBAE Systems, a military gear maker from Bristol, spent about five years and over one million pounds ($1.5 million) in research and development to create what they dubbed Wildcat. The multi-million pounds, driverless vehicle is a 4x4 off-roader manufactured by Bowler, which later was modified by the company's engineers. It was then donated to the the Department of Engineering Science of Oxford University.\n\nWildcat is equipped with computer controlled steering servos, an extra braking system and a hotline into the vehicle's engine management system for speed control. In addition, wireless data links, GPS and laser ranging sensors were installed so that the vehicle could receive instructions, navigate and avoid hitting obstacles.\n\n\"Wildcat is the result of years of advanced research and development by BAE. It will allow us to advance our own research into autonomous transport, contributing to a future of autonomy on the roads of Oxford, and around the world,\" Dr. Paul Newman at the Department of Engineering Science said upon the arrival of the vehicle.\n\nSure, it's not very clear whether the final project will belong to BAE Systems or it's going to be considered Britain's first autonomous car, thus belonging to the government, but one thing is clear: the self-driving car competition is getting hotter by the day.", "Investment analysts at Credit Suisse cut their target price on shares of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) from $195.00 to $290.00 in a note issued to investors on Thursday.

(Graham Hughes/CP)\n\nIn a major shakeup at the family-controlled Bombardier Inc., the aerospace and train manufacturer announced today that Pierre Beaudoin would step down as president and CEO, while his father, Laurent -- who led the company for more than 30 years before becoming chairman -- will retire.\n\nFormer United Technologies Corp. executive Alain Bellemare will take the helm as CEO, while Pierre Beaudoin, after nearly seven years as CEO, would become executive chairman in place of his father. The appointments take effect on Friday.\n\nAlthough it was abrupt, the shakeup was not surprising. The company's stock has languished amid executive departures, delays in two different jet development programs, a credit-rating cut, lowered profit targets, layoffs and and a strike. Investor patience wore thin some time ago. The question now is whether a new CEO can restore confidence. The fact that Bombardier shares fell 11.5% in the day's trading is not an auspicious sign.\n\n\"I would think that we could have had a bigger change in leadership,\" says Neal Dihoa, a senior analyst with Morningstar based in Chicago, Ill. \"You might say, 'Well they just changed their CEO, isn't that big enough?' But everyone else is sticking around. It's sad because the new CEO still has to go answer to the chairman of the board.\"\n\nBut Karl Moore, a management professor at McGill University says Bellemare's appointment is a positive change for the company. \"My understanding is that Alain will be the CEO, and Pierre will be there to advise him, and also to look on the merger and acquisition side of the house,\" says Moore. The two have known each other for a number of years, Moore adds.\n\n\"Because they know each other well, I think they know they can work together, and they've agreed to what the rules are,\" says Moore. \"Now, we'll see how it works out, but I think it should be fine and it should work out because of the knowledge and the relationship they have, and Alain's long experience as someone who really knows how to execute in the aerospace industry. Execution is what Bombardier really needs right now.\"\n\nBellemare is only the second outsider to run Bombardier since the company began operating in 1942 as a snowmobile maker in rural Quebec.

But the project's continued delays has mired the company as development costs continue to soar. The aircraft manufacturer was expected to begin flight tests four months ago on the jets, but due to an engine failure those have continued to be postponed. The program has now cost Bombardier US$5.4 billion, up from US$4.23 billion a year ago.\n\nOn a conference call Thursday, Beaudoin said he was \"feeling good\" about CSeries certification by the end of the year, and that the program, which was meant to compete against Boeing and Airbus in the 100-plus seat aircraft category, was meeting or exceeding his expectations. Beaudoin has said he's counting on the CSeries to help the company almost double sales by the end of the decade.\n\nIncluding a $1.4-billion previously disclosed cost, which was mainly related to the company's decision to suspend its Learjet 85 business-jet program in January, Bombardier posted a fourth-quarter loss of $1.6 billion, or 92 cents per share, compared with a profit of $97 million, or 5 cents, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue was up 12% to $5.96 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2014.\n\nThe troubled company announced during the release of its latest quarterly results that it is also suspending its dividend, and is looking to bolster its balance sheet by accessing debt markets for up to US $1.5 billion and issuing about $600 million of new equity.\n\nBombardier's announcement that it would suspend its dividend payments on both Class A and its widely held Class B shares is expected to give the company room to explore \"other initiatives\" to reduce debt.\n\nMORE ABOUT BOMBARDIER AND THE CSERIES JET:\n\nThe inside story of Bombardier's $4-billion gamble on a super quiet jet CSeries jet delays aren't the only late product launch hurting Bombardier Bombardier's CSeries problem in one chart As CSeries flounders, Bombardier's Q-Series planes are selling like hot cakes The biggest layoffs in Canadian history Follow Us Like Us", "Alain Bellemare faces what is no doubt the greatest test of his professional career.\n\nThe new president and chief executive of Bombardier Inc. arrives at the most critical juncture in the company's history.

Two weeks before his departure, he made a detour during a business trip to inspect construction of his 33-metre yacht in Taiwan, according to news reports.\n\nNot long after, at the end of January, Mr. Bellemare resigned in a restructuring at Hartford, Conn.-based UTC that eliminated his position.\n\nAt Pratt & Whitney Canada between 2002 and 2008, he oversaw as president a highly productive period of rapid growth and expansion. He presided over the launch of the PW600 class of jet engines for very light aircraft.\n\nMr. Bellemare joined P&W Canada as vice-president of manufacturing in 1996. Before that, he did manufacturing and engineering stints at Kraft Canada and Crown, Cork & Seal Canada, a maker of metal beverage and food cans.\n\nHe has a pilot's licence, and in 2004 McGill publication he said that as a child he dreamed of a career as either a professional hockey player or a pilot.\n\nAsked what else he would have done had he not taken the career path he did, he replied: \"I am very sensitive to people's suffering and needs; I would most probably be a doctor today.\"", "Here are the top Alabama business stories by AL.com reporters for Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015.

Behind them Ellie Watts (in a camel costume!) took the ladies' Open Fun Run category while the time keepers struggled to keep a tab on the countless children who joined in the fun.\n\nMeantime, Foustok was building an unassailable lead as Ken Heney was maintaining a consistent pace of just under 4min per km to edge away from Psaila who was consigned to consolidating 3rd place. Behind them Japanese runner Masato Hirakawa, who had travelled especially from Jeddah, overshadowed a large bunch of Riyadh locals to secure 4th place.\n\nFoustok, despite slowing to encourage other runners on his way round and finishing a few minutes slower than his course record, still took home 1st place and the SR250 Diadora voucher from SportZone in a time of 1:20:11.\n\nBehind him Heney picked up the SR100 Diadora voucher for 2nd place in a time of 1:22:52 as last year's winner Psaila had to settle for third.\n\nIn the ladies' category, Watson, who completed the Dubai Marathon only a couple of weeks ago and is preparing for the Marathon des Sables in April, set the pace ahead of Claudine Roghi and Naomi Gordon. Watson looked set to break her own course record, but after slowing slightly towards the end she finished in a time of 1:32:23, just six seconds outside of the record she set last year. Claire Watts dominated the Over 50s ladies' event finishing a very impressive 61st place overall out of 103 finishers.\n\nThe Sangcom Project Team would like to thank all those who helped make this event a success, among them the main sponsor ABTSS, ITEA International, BTC, Airbus, Marsh, the Caledonian Society and the host for the day BAE Systems.\n\nCategory winners:\n\nMen's Open Half-Marathon:\n\n1st - Mohamed Foustok - 1:20:11\n\n2nd Kenneth Heney - 1:22:52\n\n3rd - Ben Psaila - 1:24:15\n\nLadies' Open Half-Marathon:\n\n1st - Anna-Marie Watson - 1:32:23\n\n2nd - Claudine Roghi - 1:40:41\n\n3rd - Naomi Gordon - 1:46:17\n\nMen's Over 50 Half Marathon:\n\n1st - Jean Pierre Berthiaux - 1:32:50\n\nLadies' Over 50 Half Marathon:\n\n1st - Claire Watts - 2:06:11", "It's happening people. If 1984 wasn't already upon us, it will be soon. CCTV cameras, of which there are already \"smart\" ones that can count people and identify cars, are about to get a bit smarter.\n\nA million-pound project to develop cameras that sense violence breaking out on the street is being undertaken by Cardiff University and the Airbus group.\n\nIts aim is to spot trouble as it's brewing and guide police before anyone gets hurt. The study will develop imaging technology able to automatically alert CCTV operators when fights are detected on city centre cameras - meaning the cameras won't have the final say on what is and isn't violent.\n\nThe cameras will benefit the economy, if successful, by reducing costs to health services and ensuring police officers are deployed as effectively as possible.\n\nThe Home Office estimates that an average violent incident costs more than \u00a333,000 in NHS and criminal justice costs, lost working hours, and the impact on victims.

Officers can't monitor hundreds of city centre CCTV cameras all the time.\n\n\"By using imaging technology, officers will be alerted to violence 'hotspots' in real time, helping to further reduce violence.

The experience helped me understand the positive impact that video analysis holds for society.\" he said.\n\nThe Welsh Government will provide the funding for the project, while Airbus is developing the technology.", "Under the current regime, Bombardier Inc. and its investors have suffered through a string of disappointments spanning years, putting the company's credibility in question. At a critical phase in its evolution, Bombardier announced a change in leadership on Thursday, as well a series of financial measures designed to preserve capital, raise cash and finance the development of its planes. Here are five things you need to know about the changes at Bombardier.\n\nThe Shakeup\n\nBoth father and son have ceded their posts, making way for new era in the company's leadership ranks. Laurent Beaudoin is leaving as chairman, ending a storied tenure with the company that began in earnest when he became president of Bombardier in the 1960s, shortly after the death of company founder Joseph-Armand Bombardier. Under his leadership, Mr. Beaudoin transformed the company into a transportation multinational before handing the reins to his son Pierre in 2008. His reign a rocky one, Pierre announced on Thursday that he would step aside as president and CEO, assuming the role of executive chairman. He will be replaced by Alain Bellemare, who left United Technologies Corp. last month after an 18-year career, including a stretch as president of Pratt & Whitney Canada, which builds engines for Bombardier's C Series jets.\n\nThe Family\n\nThe company's namesake family has relinquished some control in the executive suite, with Laurent Beaudoin retiring and the CEO office now to be occupied by Mr. Bellemare, the third CEO in the company's history to come from outside the family. But the Bombardier family will maintain a tight grip on the world's only manufacturer of both planes and trains. Like many family-run companies, Bombardier has a dual-class share structure, with each class A share representing 10 votes. The Beaudoins and Bombardiers hold a big majority of class A shares.\n\nThe Stock\n\nThe more-widely traded class B shares have not proven to be lucrative investments for several years. The financial crisis and ensuing recession saw spending on corporate jets and commercial aircraft slashed, sending Bombardier's stock into a steep decline from which it has never fully recovered. Investors lost confidence in the stock again in 2011 over weak regional aircraft sales, the loss of a $2.3-billion (U.S.) deal for the U.K.'s Thameslink rail system, and concerns about the company's C Series passenger jet program. In January, amid pressures on the company's cash flow, Bombardier suspended development of its new Learjet 85 and cut 1,000 jobs. Over the next few trading days, the stock declined by almost 40 per cent, setting a new 6-year low.\n\nThe Quarter\n\nThe company's changes were announced in conjunction with the release of fourth-quarter financial statements, which were discouraging. Even after a prior warning to investors, Bombardier's earnings still managed to fall short of analysts' expectations. Free cash flow fell to $590-million from $771-million a year earlier, which made suspension of the company's quarterly dividend an expected announcement, given the cash crunch. The company distributed $182-million in dividends in 2014. To protect its balance sheet, Bombardier also said it would issue up to $600-million of new equity and up to $1.5-billion of new debt. In a trend now familiar to Bombardier's shareholders, the stock declined 18 per cent shortly after the start of Thursday trading, briefly setting a new multi-year, intraday low of $2.50, before inching higher.\n\nThe C Series\n\nThe fate of Bombardier still very much hinges on the C Series jet program, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. The company's biggest line of planes, intended to compete with smaller passenger jets from Boeing and Airbus, were supposed to go into service in 2013. On Thursday, Pierre Beaudoin said the cost of the program has risen to $5.4-billion, up by about $1-billion from a year ago. He also said the plane is scheduled to go into service in the second-half of this year, although the market has long become used to missed deadlines on the C Series.", "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande said Egypt would order 24 Rafale fighter jets, a naval frigate and related military equipment in a deal to be signed in Cairo on Monday worth more than 5 billion euros (3.7 billion pounds).\n\nThe contract would make Egypt, aiming to upgrade its military hardware amid fears the crisis in neighbouring Libya could spill over, the first export customer for the warplane, built by Dassault Aviation.\n\nIt follows years of failed attempts by France to export the plane.\n\n\"The Rafale fighter jet has won its first export contract,\" Hollande's office said in a statement.\n\n\"The Egyptian authorities have just let me know their intention of acquiring 24 Rafale planes, a multi-mission frigate as well as related equipment.\" The latter items consist of a Fremm warship and MBDA air-to-air missiles.\n\nHollande, in Brussels for a European Council meeting, added that the sale accord would be signed in Cairo on Monday by Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nThe contract would be the first overseas for the Rafale, 14 years after it entered service and three years after Dassault Aviation entered exclusive negotiations to sell 126 of the combat jets to India.\n\nDelays in finalising the Indian contract are expected to be discussed at a major Indian air show starting on Feb. 18.\n\nDassault is also in negotiations to supply the Rafale to Qatar and under increasing pressure to sell the plane overseas.\n\nThe French government said last year it would slow the pace at which it takes delivery of Rafale jets, to just 26 over the next five years instead of 11 a year.\n\nParis and Cairo have enjoyed close economic ties in the past but turmoil in the north African state since President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in 2011 left Western governments wary of signing deals, especially in defence.\n\nWith the rise to power of Sisi, ties have improved. Both sides are concerned by the rise of jihadist groups in Libya and Egypt.\n\nFrance secured its first major military contract in Egypt in about 20 years in 2014 with a 1 billion-euro ($1.35 billion) deal to sell four naval frigates.\n\nThe Fremm is built by state-controlled DCNS, which is 35 percent owned by French group Thales. MBDA is a venture of Airbus Group, Britain's BAE Systems and Finmeccanica of Italy.\n\n(Additional reporting by Cyril Altmeyerhenzien in Paris and Yara Bayoumy in Cairo; Editing by Andrew Roche)", "The lingering Eurozone crisis has brought with it a decline in the value of the euro vs. the U.S. dollar. With the economic situation in Europe still shaky, the European Central Bank (ECB) has initiated a strategy of quantitative easing to spur growth. At the same time, problems in Greece have not gone away, and the new Greek government is threatening to exit the euro currency. All of these things are likely to keep the euro low for some time to come, and as with most things, there will be winners and losers in the U.S. economy. (See also, Will The ECB's Quantitative Easing Sink The Euro?)\n\nImporters of European goods. Companies that use European parts as inputs will find their supply chains becoming more affordable. Transportation companies that purchase European cars and trucks will benefit by adding to their fleet at a reduced cost. Similarly, airlines that buy their planes from Airbus or other European aircraft manufacturers will do so at better-than-usual prices. This can help boost profit margins for these firms.\n\nU.S. consumers. American consumers will find that imported consumables, such as fine wines and cheeses from France and Italy, have become more affordable. German cars, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen, will all become less expensive at showrooms in the U.S.\n\nInvestors in European companies that do big business in the U.S. American investors are able to buy shares of foreign companies through ADRs which are listed on U.S. stock exchanges. European ADRs of companies that have a large presence in the U.S. may benefit by increasing sales here. Bayer, the German producer of over-the-counter drugs, reports that a 1% depreciation of the euro could increase company sales by \u20ac260 million. Airbus could see a $1 billion boost in profits for every 0.10 decline in the euro, and chemical manufacturer BASF forecasts an extra \u20ac50 million in earnings for every one cent the euro drops.\n\nTourists and travelers to Europe. When the euro is weak, it means the dollar must be strong relatively speaking. Tourists and business travelers will see their dollar go farther while abroad. U.S. companies who regularly send employees to Europe for business will also benefit from cheaper accommodations. Ex-pats who live in European cities but earn dollars will also see their cost of living go down.\n\nExporters to Europe. U.S. companies that export to Europe will lose out as their products become more expensive for European buyers. Companies such as beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), tobacco companies like Philip Morris (PM), fast food chains including McDonalds (MCD), and consumer electronics and appliance producers like Harman International (HAR) all rely on sales to European customers as a large portion of their annual revenues. These companies may see their profitability suffer as a result. Investors in domestic companies that have large exposure to the European market should be wary.\n\nThe U.S. tourism industry. Tourism may suffer as American destinations become more expensive for European citizens. While it is true that the industry has reported fewer European travelers visiting the U.S. each year for the past few years, tourists from other parts of the world such as Asia and South America have reduced the negative impact of fewer Europeans. Ex-pats from Europe living in America but earning euros will see their cost of living increase.\n\nThe weakening of the euro against the dollar has created both winners and losers in America, and there is potential that the euro value may continue to slide. While importers and consumers of European goods will benefit, U.S. exporters to Europe will lose out. U.S. travelers to Europe will find that their dollar goes further, but Europeans may avoid traveling to America as their euros will buy less. Domestic companies that do a large amount of business in Europe will experience lower profitability for their investors, while European companies that do big business in America may see rising share prices.", "SilkAir, the 100 per cent Singapore Airlines subsidiary regional short-to-medium-haul carrier, has announced plans to expand its range in India, by exploring destinations in the North and West.\n\nThe airline, which is already active in eight cities in India -- Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai (joint operations with Singapore Airlines), and Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Coimbatore (standalone) -- will now be focusing more on Tier-II and Tier-II\u2008cities to provide greater connectivity.\n\n\"We connect 48 destinations in Asia with Singapore. In India, we are looking at Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Chandigarh and Amritsar as potential destinations,\" SilkAir General Manager India Jagdish Ram Bhojwani told Deccan Herald, without revealing further details.\n\nCurrently, SilkAir has a fleet of 28 aircraft comprising Airbus A319s, A320s and Boeing 737-800s. It is planning to replace its entire Airbus fleet with new Boeing 737s in the near future.\n\nIn 2012, SilkAir finalised an order for 54 Next-Generation 737s (23 737-800s and 31 737 MAX 8s) worth $4.9 billion at list prices, which will be deployed from late-2016.\n\n\"Our network involves flying to destinations which are situated five hours away from Singapore. The B737-800 MAX will enable us to extend our flight range to over six hours of fly time. Hence, we foresee expansion into the northern and western markets of India by late 2016,\" Bhojwani said.\n\nThe foray into smaller markets would also mean that the airline is able to provide connectivity to the Singapore Airlines network in India, by serving more regions collectively.\n\nATF price cut helps\n\nThe reduction in ATF prices by the government has encouraged Singapore Airlines to reduce its fuel surcharges for tickets issued on or after February 26, 2015. The new fuel surcharge levels will apply to Singapore Airlines and SilkAir flights, representing a decrease of between $5 and $83 per sector, depending on distance and class of travel.\n\n\"Fuel prices have declined in recent months, although jet fuel continues to account for a significant percentage of our group expenditure. Meanwhile, the government has been supportive, and with greater emphasis on developing suitable infrastructure to make our planned destinations airport-ready, we may realise our plans effectively,\" he said.\n\nSilkAir, which is bullish on India, has increased seasonal flight frequencies from most of its destinations.\n\n\"Our annual load factor for FY 2014 is at 65-70 per cent, which is expected to touch 74 per cent this fiscal,\" he said. \"With greater range will come more inbound tourism, education, and job creation. The employment generated at each new destination would be to the tune of 100-200 jobs.\"\n\nSilkAir clocked an operating profit of $18 million in the third quarter FY 2014-15, compared with $6 million during the same quarter of FY 2013-14. The company is growing at 2-4 per cent year-on-year. On average, it is adding four destinations in Asia to its network each year, Bhojwani said.", "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Airbus Group forecast on Thursday that 36 percent of its A320 aircraft family deliveries this year will be the A321 jetliner, up from 31 percent in 2014.\n\n\"By end of this year, 36 percent of deliveries will be A321, and it will be an even bigger proportion as we move forward,\" Simon Pickup, strategic marketing director at Airbus Americas, said at an industry conference near Seattle.\n\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nAirbus says A321 to account for 36 percent of A320 deliveries in 2015 - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "It's happening people.

And more than 90 per cent of Fijians travelling abroad depart on one. And that's not to mention all the Fijians who rely on our domestic airlines to travel within Fiji - to visit family, travel home or into the city, and access crucial services.\n\nGiven the huge importance that civil aviation plays in the Fijian economy - supporting our Tourism industry - and in our national life, I thought it appropriate to provide this honourable House with an update on this important portfolio.\n\nMadam Speaker, I will cover a broad range of topics and touch on a number of important initiatives, policies and plans within the Department of Civil Aviation to ensure amongst other things (inter alia) that air travel into, within and out of Fiji is safe, reliable and affordable.\n\nMadam Speaker, I would like to begin by outlining Government's plans to develop the infrastructure of the 15 airports operated by Airports Fiji Ltd. This is in line with the FijiFirst Government's plans to reform and modernise the aviation industry in Fiji to be globally competitive.\n\nAll told, AFL is looking to deliver around $250 million worth of capital upgrades over the next five (5) years, which demonstrates just how serious we are about this program. It will have huge benefits in terms of economic growth and development - including in our maritime zones - and job creation.\n\nThe centrepiece of this program is the Nadi Airport Terminal Modernization Project, which commenced in August 2014. The New Zealand company - Hawkins Infrastructure Ltd - was selected to carry out the work, which is scheduled to be completed by May 2016.\n\nThis year, the Fijian people and the visitors to our shores can expect to see a burst of activity and we kindly ask for their patience and understanding as the work is carried out. We promise, it will be worth the wait. Faster queues at check-in and through security, a spacious departure and check-in hall, views for the passengers in the departure lounge, top-quality food and beverages, a children's play corner, a prayer room, a modern VIP lounge and spa facilities. And of course a segregated smoking area for those who do.\n\nThere is also a plan to in the near future build at least a 70 room transit hotel located within the Nadi Airport complex.\n\nOf course, Madam Speaker, the major upgrade plans for Nausori airport are equally exciting. They include a runway extension - so that larger planes can land in Suva - and a new terminal. This will have huge benefits for our capital city, its people and its businesses.\n\nGovernment will intensify negotiations for the acquisition of about 35 hectares of land necessary for these upgrades and we look forward to finalising this matter this year.\n\nAnd of course, Madam Speaker, we also have our eye on Fiji's 13 outer island airports. We are committed to providing AFL the necessary support for capital projects, maintenance, and upgrades for these facilities. In this regard, one of our major focuses is the upgrade of the Rotuma airstrip.\n\nMadam Speaker, we are also focused on helping AFL continue to improve its own performance so that we can maximise the benefits we as a nation derive from these facilities, especially after they are upgraded.\n\nAs a result of the successful revenue restructuring and the achievement of operational cost efficiencies over the past few years, AFL's profit forecast at a conservative approach \"after tax\" is $33 million for 2015 and $46 million for 2016.\n\nWhile these numbers are forecasts, we think it's possible to surpass them if we are able to continue accessing new markets working with Fiji Airways and with other airlines. And we take a disciplined commercial approach to operating Airport. Of course madam speaker this was not possible under the previous Governments nor would it have been if the other side was on this side. In fact madam speaker until 2007 AFL was either making a loss or breaking even or just a minuscule profit if any.\n\nMadam Speaker, Government has called for expressions of interest for the acquisition of shares in AFL by the private sector and confidential negotiations are currently under way. This critical to ensure commercial confidence. As AFL's performance continues to improve, the share value in AFL will concomitantly rise - generating more interest internationally and giving more value to Fiji.\n\nWith the divestment and the increased profits of AFL, the current arrangement where Government funds outer island capital works while AFL as part of its social responsibility picks up the tab for operational costs for those airports, we will be in a position to have AFL carry out capital works from its own cash flow including the operational costs. We are in the process of developing an MOU in this respect.\n\nMadam Speaker, there is no doubt the AFL's turn-around has been remarkable in particular under the guidance and leadership of its chairman, Mr. Faiz Khan. The Board also consists of the likes of Geofferey Shaw, a well known hotelier, Tui Macuata - Ratu Wiliame Katonivere and Xavier Khan. But the question isn't if AFL is doing well. Because it is, beyond doubt. Remarkably well. The question is whether it can do even better. As a Government, we want the best - for our people and for our nation.\n\nThe point, Madam Speaker, is this. With the right people for the right job and now the right strategic partner, we can do even more, achieve even more, offer even more. As we have seen with Fiji Ports, the right partnership with the private sector has incredible benefits. It will further our case to become the hub for aviation in the region - recognised around the region and the world for the high standard of our facilities and the quality of our services.\n\nMadam Speaker, I am pleased also to report in this House today the spectacular performance of Fiji Airways.\n\nAs I'm sure my fellow Members will know, it's been a busy few years for the airline as it has achieved a remarkable turn-around of fortunes - a complete rebranding, a profit-sharing scheme for its staff and an ambitious plan to expand its operations.\n\nIt feels like yesterday when we welcomed the first new Airbus A330 - the Island of Taveuni. As the Prime Minister said at the time: Bearing a uniquely Fijian design, the plane was a flying billboard for Fiji - a message to the world that we are open for business and want to share our beautiful surroundings, our culture and our hospitality with the peoples of other lands.\n\nSince then, there's been no looking back for the airline. Two new Airbus A330s followed the first - Namuka-i-Lau and Yasawa-i-rara. And Fiji Airways has announced plans to lease a new Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A330-300, which will both enter its fleet in 2015. Following that, an additional 737-800 is planned for 2017.\n\nAnd in the domestic market, Pacific Sun has become Fiji Link - another addition to \"Brand Fiji\" - the FijiFirst Government's program to distinguish an internationally recognised Fijian brand that is known for its quality and uniqueness.\n\nFiji Link has revamped its fleet by purchasing an ATR 72-600 and ATR 42-600. It has also leased an additional ATR 72-600 to meet the demand for expanding routes. This has significantly improved the services it can offer its customers. Indeed, the new fleet has allowed our national carrier to strengthen its Pacific and international network.\n\nMadam Speaker, the results of all this activity is undeniable. Fiji Airways will soon announce its 2014 financial results, which are more than double the best profit in its history.\n\nBut Madam Speaker, I think that many would agree that the airlines biggest accomplishment is no doubt the creation of a team of committed and motivated individuals, who are working together better than ever to bring our national airline to new heights. I have no doubt this great success will continue in 2015, together with a great dividend for its shareholders.\n\nMadam Speaker, I would like to pay special tribute to the Managing Director and CEO, Stefan Pichler, for the great work he has done at Fiji Airways. We are very sorry to see him depart as CEO, but are happy that he will remain on the Board and continue to support the strategic development of the group.\n\nStefan has ensured that he is leaving behind an outstanding group of senior managers, and he is also playing a key role in the selection of a new CEO. So I can assure this House that business will continue as usual.\n\nMadam Speaker, Fiji Airways is continuously adding new routes to its service on the back of its fleet expansion.\n\nBeginning this month, Fiji Airways will start its Shanghai charters service - in partnership with Rosie Holidays - the first step toward tapping into the vast Asian market. In April, it will commence it's direct Honiara service. And in June, the airline will add Wellington to its list of direct New Zealand destinations.\n\nThere are plans to have an extra flight to Sydney, Melbourne, and Christchurch; to increase the frequency of ATR services; and to add an additional flight to Hong Kong in the peak holiday periods. And there will also be more flights to Taveuni, extra capacity on the Nadi-Suva route, and more supplementary services in peak periods.\n\nWhat's more, Madam Speaker, the new A330-300 will provide a 6 per cent capacity increase for the airline's popular Los Angeles route.\n\nI think we can all agree that the future of the airline has never looked brighter.\n\nUnfortunately, Madam Speaker, there are those who want to downplay Fiji Airways' potential by arguing for a closer relationship with Qantas. I would like to clearly state that they still hold 46% of Fiji Airways' shares. An issue we need to deal with in time to come.\n\nBut the fact is this, Madam Speaker. As a country that relies on tourism, it is absolutely essential that we have a national airline and that we have control of the fortunes of that airline. It's a matter of national interest. We cannot be subject to the commercial interests of foreign airlines alone.\n\nThat's why it was so important that we removed Qantas' veto rights in essential areas of the airlines operations. As a minority shareholder, these should never have been granted in the first place by Rabuka's SVT Government. And that's why the FijiFirst Government is committed to ensuring the viability and success of Fiji Airways.\n\nMadam Speaker, as a nation, we have acceded to many International Conventions and Treaties relating to Civil Aviation, such as the Warsaw and Chicago Conventions, to promote the safety and security of air travel. And so, Madam Speaker, I would now like to turn my attention to providing an update on the activities of the Department of Civil Aviation, which is responsible for ensuring Fiji is in compliance with these agreements.\n\nThe Department of Civil Aviation is responsible for the safe, efficient and effective regulation of air transport in Fiji. It develops air safety protocols, in line with international standards, and oversees/regulates the development of Fijian airports.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Civil Aviation is in charge of ensuring necessary compliance to the International Civil Aviation Organization standards, through the regulatory arm of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji - CAAF.\n\nCAAF regulates the safety and security in the civil aviation industry in Fiji. By effective implementation of the international safety standards set by the ICAO and their recommended practices, the Fiji civil aviation system is well above the global average and the highest in the South Pacific region (excluding Australia and New Zealand).\n\nWe are currently in the process of harmonising the Fiji Air Navigation Regulations with international best practices and standards to further raise our already exemplary record.\n\nAnd so, Madam Speaker, the Department manages the allocation of $3 million to CAAF for safety and security oversight.\n\nMadam Speaker, in addition to the focus on safe management, the Department also negotiates and reviews Air Services Agreements for the expansion of our aviation and tourism markets.\n\nMadam Speaker, for those who do not know, an ASA is an agreement between two nations to allow international commercial transport services to be established.\n\nThey are extremely important to a nation like Fiji - which relies heavily on tourism and is an island nation - and therefore it is absolutely necessary that we enforce their terms - which have been carefully considered and agreed to by both parties.\n\nAn example of this was the recent dispute with Solomon Islands after it breached its agreement with us. Flights were suspended after a Fiji Airways flight was refused a landing slot in Honiara by the Civil Aviation Authority of Solomon Islands.\n\nMadam Speaker, I am very pleased that this dispute has now been amicably resolved. But the point remains: Fiji takes its obligations under the ASA, as with other international obligations, very seriously and fully complies with its obligations.\n\nAt the same time, Fiji expects that those countries which sign ASAs with Fiji to also comply with their obligations. If they fail to do so, Fiji has a clear sovereign right to assert the terms of those agreements.\n\nMadam Speaker, Fiji has concluded agreements with 28 countries, including New Zealand, Australia, France, the United States of America, and Singapore. A total of 11 airlines - including Fiji Airways - have been issued licenses permitting them to operate air services.\n\nJetstar - one of the designated airlines of Australia - has recently been approved to operate three flights per week on the Gold Coast/Colangatta-Nadi service. The opening of this route through Jetstar will capture the Australian Eastern seaboard region North of Sydney and South of Brisbane, in addition to the existing four flights per week on the Sydney-Nadi service.\n\nIn addition, Madam Speaker, Russia and the United Arab Emirates have both approached Fiji to sign ASAs and negotiations are currently underway.\n\nBut I think that it is important to stress, Madam Speaker, that it is our responsibility as Government to ensure that our national interests are always protected.\n\nTherefore, Fiji does not support full air transport deregulation, also known as an Open Skies policy.This policy must be approached with caution and great care, as the time is simply not right for Fiji to enter such an arrangement with other sovereignties. We also do not support generally giving fifth and sixth freedom rights because they can have deleterious effect on Fiji Airways and Fijian interests.\n\nMadam Speaker, the Department also oversees the continual implementation of the important air subsidy scheme, to encourage air operators onto routes deemed uneconomical via a tender process.\n\nDomestic airline operators use these subsidies to facilitate trade, tourism, and public travel needs that are so essential for our maritime communities.\n\nThe tender process requires airline operators to bid the cost of operating air services to the outer island routes. Government then subsidises any shortfalls in the total revenue generated on a trip.\n\nMadam Speaker, the 2015 tender was advertised on 4 October 2014 and Fiji Link was awarded the tender for Vanuabalavu, Lakeba, Rotuma, Cicia and Koro. Northern Air was awarded the tender for Gau and Ono-i-Lau.\n\nAnd for the first time, Government is now also subsidising the Suva-Kadavu route.\n\nMadam Speaker, the award of tenders takes into account various factors such as the cost of operations, which incorporates the airline's profit margin, the aircraft capacity, airfares and the ability of the airline to generate revenue on the tendered route.\n\nMadam Speaker, allow me to provide a few examples that illustrate my point.\n\nThe Koro route was awarded to Fiji Link as they tendered a larger capacity 19-seater twin-otter aircraft with a lower cost of operation of $4,830, whereas Northern Air tendered a lesser capacity 9-seater Islander aircraft, with a higher cost of operation of $5,000.\n\nFurthermore, the Suva-Kadavu route was awarded to Fiji Link as they tendered a larger capacity 19-seater twin-otter aircraft whereas Northern Air tendered a lesser capacity 9-seater Islander aircraft, despite both airlines tendering an equivalent cost of operation of $4,000.00.\n\nMadam Speaker, without the Government subsidy, the air services to these outer islands would be not be feasible for airlines and air services to these areas would cease.\n\nFor example, the distance between Nadi to Rotuma is approximately 587km, which is a two and a half hour flight from Nadi to Rotuma, with no refuelling facilities available in Rotuma.\n\nThe airline operator on this route has to ship its fuel in advance to cater for the return flight from Rotuma. The Government subsidy assists airlines to recover the cost of operating this route with a reasonable profit margin.\n\nMadam Speaker, overall, as I have outlined, we are excited about the year ahead. There is much to look forward to in the year ahead.\n\nMadam Speaker, thank you for your time in allowing me to speak.\n\nVinaka", "A \u00a31m project to develop \"smart\" cameras which sense violence on the streets is being developed by Cardiff University researchers.\n\nComputer science and violence experts are teaming up with technology specialists from Airbus Group to develop a system that will spot trouble brewing and guide police before anyone gets hurt.\n\nThe study will develop imaging technology which will automatically alert CCTV operators when fights are detected on city centre cameras.", "Bengaluru, Feb 12: Team Airbus is landing in Aviation Capital of Bengaluru with a commitment to be part of government's 'Make in India' programme.\n\nAt Aero India 2015, the Airbus Group will present a wide range of cutting-edge products and technologies including commercial platforms, military aircraft/helicopters and radars.\n\nIn a unique initiative that could provide immense opportunities for talented engineers in India, the Airbus Group is conducting a recruitment fair at the show.

This on-board cockpit technology, which Airbus has pioneered independently over several years, increases pilots' situational awareness during landing, reduces exposure to runway excursion risk, and if necessary, provides active protection.\n\nCurrently, the airlines flies to five destinations in India namely; daily flights to Mumbai and Kochi; six times a week to Delhi and four times a week to Chennai and Thiruvanathapuram.", "When buying a car or decorating a home, practical-minded people worry about maximising the future resale value.\n\nSo too, it seems, do billionaires buying private jets that can cost between $US87 million ($112 million) to an upper range of $US200 million-plus.\n\n\"The smarter customers won't do black or red walls [in an aircraft] just like you probably wouldn't in your home,\" Airbus Corporate Jets marketing director David Velupillai said during a visit to Sydney on Thursday. \"Because when it comes time to sell it, it is going to be harder to sell. That is why you will often see business jets have a neutral colour cabin. Beige is very widespread. Because the smarter customers are thinking ahead to that one day they will sell it.\"\n\nSince the mid-1980s Airbus has sold 170 corporate jets, which are modified versions of the same A320 and A330 family aircraft flown by commercial airlines. The customer base is relatively evenly split between individuals, companies and governments. The individual market for the jets, which compete against offerings from Boeing, Gulfstream and Bombardier is comprised of a single demographic: billionaires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe top markets for Airbus include China, the Middle East and Russia. It has yet to sell any of its corporate jets to individuals in Australia, although politician Clive Palmer, miner Gina Rinehart and logistics king Lindsay Fox own models by other manufacturers.\n\nGood things are worth waiting for\n\nAirbus and rival Boeing dominate the upper-end of the private jet spectrum. Buying these aircraft is a very time-consuming proposition. Mr Velupillai said if a customer ordered one immediately, a narrowbody ACJ319 - a modified version of the A319 used by airlines - would not be delivered for another 18 months to two years. A widebody ACJ330, which could fly to Los Angeles or Dubai non-stop from Sydney, would not be delivered for two to two and a half years.\n\nAirbus has introduced special interiors packages for the time-poor billionaire that does not want every little item on the jet to be customised. But for those that want a fully customised luxurious plane, almost any request can be fulfilled, whether it be gold-plated taps in the bathroom or extremely rare leather.\n\n\"The lead time for that leather is the time it takes for a cow to be born,\" Mr Velupillai said of that bespoke request. \"It comes from a special part of the Pyrenees. This special part of the Pyrenees is an area where there aren't any brambles and things that can tear the skin of the cow so you get a nice piece of leather. So people go to incredible lengths to get that kind of stuff.\"\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the private jets don't tend to contain anything more exotic than a bedroom, shower or bar. \"These customers are not looking for the exotic,\" Mr Velupillai said. \"They are not looking for saunas and gyms. They are looking for a way to take their lifestyle on the ground into the air. They are looking to take their luxury apartment or their luxury villa into the air. They are looking to take their office into the air.\"\n\nThere are, however, certain special considerations that must be made due to the unique environment which requires all of the cabin interiors receive certification from regulators. Lighter materials are better because they will reduce fuel burn and give the aircraft a greater range. The materials should not be able to burn easily or produce toxic emissions in the unlikely event of a crash landing. The centre of gravity is also important to ensure the aircraft can fly safely.\n\nAnd just as consumer confidence affects whether middle-class consumers feel comfortable buying a car or house, it also can be an important factor in the private jet market. \"Just like you and I who are nervous about spending money when things are a little uncertain, you could see a billionaire doing the same thing, saying 'I'll keep my existing jet for a couple of years until things have settled down,'\" Mr Velupillai said.", "DMA testing is an instrumental technique in which the mechanical deformation of carbon fibre-reinforced composites is analysed, and focuses on measurement of glass transition temperature. The approval comes following a concerted effort by Exova to obtain Airbus approval for this critical test, including recent investments in new DMA equipment.\n\nThe Anaheim, California laboratory also worked closely with the other Airbus-approved Exova laboratories in Bridgwater, UK and Toulouse, France to ensure that test methods and procedures were well-aligned. The Anaheim laboratory previously obtained Airbus' authorisation for a range of mechanical and analytical tests. The addition of a local approved laboratory for DMA testing will significantly reduce turnaround times for North American customers.\n\nRocco Moro, Executive VP for Aerospace in the Americas, said: \"As composites play an increasingly important role on large commercial aircraft, there is growing demand for specialised testing such as DMA. This new approval makes Exova the first and only third party testing laboratory in North America to receive Airbus approval for DMA testing and reinforces our commitment to provide technically demanding services to the aerospace industry.\"\n\nExova Anaheim's primary customer for DMA testing is Spirit AeroSystems in Kinston, NC which requires testing of its Section 15 (Center Fuselage) composite components and Main Wing Spars for the Airbus A350XWB commercial airliner. Exova is also now in a position to perform DMA testing for other Airbus sub-contractors in North America, which require certification to the Airbus specification.", "By David Pugliese\n\nDefence Watch\n\nStamina seems to be a key ingredient for companies who want to take part in Canadian military procurement programs. Take for instance the firms that have been for at least 11 years trying to interest the Canadian Forces in buying their aircraft for the fixed wing search and rescue project.\n\nWhen the request for proposals is released later this year, three firms will be the only ones left standing.\n\nAlenia Aermacchi will be offering the C-27J Spartan, Airbus Military has its C295 and Lockheed Martin is promoting the C-130J. (of the three, Lockheed is a relative newcomer....Alenia and Airbus have been promoting their planes in Canada for more than 11 years now).\n\nBut what about the other potential contenders?\n\nBombardier was one of those but company officials say the firm is no longer pursuing the project because of the requirement for a rear ramp on the FWSAR aircraft. Its Q series/Dash 8 planes do not have such a ramp and the cost of redesigning and certifying such aircraft to take part in the competition would be prohibitive.\n\nBoeing, which at one point was hoping to offer Canada the V-22 Osprey for search and rescue, has gone silent.\n\nViking Air Ltd of Sidney, BC had proposed that it provide new production DHC-5 Buffalo aircraft, with the work being done in manufacturing facilities in Sidney and in Calgary, Alberta. The Buffalo is currently used by the Canadian Forces for fixed-wing search and rescue on the west coast.\n\nBut Viking has yet to build a new production Buffalo, a situation that would hinder any bid since it is expected than the request for proposals would call for flight testing of an existing aircraft.\n\nViking Air officials recently confirmed to Esprit de Corps magazine that the company no longer considers itself a \"prime contender\" for the project and has pulled back from the program.", "Bengaluru, Feb 12: Bell Helicopter has lined up a fine array of its latest military and commercial rotorcraft offerings during the upcoming Aero India 2015.

During a recent select-media briefing ahead of Aero India 2015, the MBDA officials said that the MBDA partnership will be a major boost to Indian defence industry sector and the government's Make in India strategy.\n\nThe officials say that India can expect a great degree of transfer of technology from the French government, at a level never before provided, anywhere else in the world. \"MBDA will provide the necessary expertise such as high fidelity models so that automated production lines can be set up in India for missile, seeker and subassembly production. India will have full autonomy for future missile development and production,\" an MBDA official said.\n\nHe said the first deliveries to the Indian armed forces will begin within three years after the project takes off.\n\n\"We are working with on 5th generation ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) for France with an expected delivery in 2017. Last year MBDA had proposed to India the prospect of jointly developing a fifth generation ATGM aimed at India's own specific requirements, offering full transfer of the de-risked technology currently being worked on for the French Army,\" the top MBDA official said.\n\nHe said DRDO to be the design authority supported by MBDA in the development of a family of identical caliber missiles with ranges and platforms to be determined by India (ranges from 2.5 km to 10 km, platforms to include helicopters, armoured vehicles, tripods.)\n\nHowever, a top DRDO official in the Missile Complex told OneIndia that the fate of the SR-SAM project is not known to them as well. \"It's a government decision and as far as we know the project has been shelved,\" an official said.\n\nMore FDI must flow in defence sector: Tatas\n\nThe Tata Group of companies pitched hard to propel Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' dream a reality through increased flow of investments into the domestic defence sector.\n\nMukund Rajan, a key face in the group told media ahead of Aero India 2015 the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into domestic defence sector has been very meagre in the last 15 years. \"It is startling how little FDI has come into India in the past 15 years. A mere $4.94 million has come as FDI in the defence and aerospace sector in India since 2000,\" Rajan said.\n\nThe Tata group has already made inroads in some of the critical aerospace and defence programmes in the country. He said the group's current order book position aerospace and defence sector is Rs 10,000 crore-plus.\n\nAs reported by OneIndia earlier, the company is the lone bidder for the Avro replacement programme, which is now stuck at the Defence Acquisition Council level.

For a variety of reasons, the actual work of building the AEC framework is not going as smoothly or quickly as planned, so its impact is going to be gradual.\n\nOne of the sectors likely to be affected fairly soon, however -- perhaps as soon as the early part of next year -- is the air transport sector. And right now the two major components of that sector, the airlines and the infrastructure, are in no way prepared to compete in the AEC.\n\nTwo editorials on Tuesday took up the subject of the Philippines' lousy airport infrastructure; BusinessMirror addressed the multi-agency squabble that has stalled the Mactan-Cebu airport expansion project, while Boo Chanco in the Philstar held forth on the lack of any effective action on the part of the Department of Transportation and Communications to address congestion at NAIA.\n\nBoth of them reveal some alarming things we should probably be concerned about. The Mactan-Cebu project has hit a snag because of the need to relocate part of an air base; apparently, the DOTC, the airport's management, the Philippine Air Force, and the Bases Conversion and Development Authority did not actually talk about it before the contract for the project was awarded.\n\nIn the case of NAIA, there has been no progress in relieving NAIA's air traffic stress. Since the government seems unable to decide on a replacement for the country's outdated and overworked international gateway, the next best option is a third runway. Not, as Boo Chanco pointed out in an amusing way, the recent proposal to build a fifth terminal.\n\nThe airlines have their own dramas as well. The transition of Philippine Airlines back to the control of Lucio Tan after San Miguel Corp. gave up on its foray into the airline business seems to have gone smoothly, but there are indications PAL is reeling in its ambitions to some degree; at the end of last month, PAL Holdings head Jaime Bautista disclosed the airline is seeking to defer the purchase of 38 aircraft it has ordered from Airbus.\n\nCebu Pacific, on the other hand, seems to have trouble avoiding being newsworthy for the wrong reasons. The havoc the Philippines' busiest airline caused with its breakdown in staffing over the Christmas holiday resulted in a P52 million fine and a public apology. Cebu Pacific is entitled to the benefit of the doubt with respect to its assurances that corrections will be made quickly, but any succeeding problem, even a small one, is going to be pounced on by the public.\n\nAmong other airlines, AirAsia Zest had the misfortune of suffering a minor accident -- a flight from Manila overshot the runway upon landing in Kalibo -- the same day its sister airline in Indonesia suffered the loss of Flight QZ8501 in stormy weather off Borneo.\n\nAnd UAE-based Emirates Airlines has been embroiled in a dispute with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for months over an unauthorized extra flight the airline added to its Dubai-Manila schedule. At the end of last week, Emirates raised a complaint to the Office of the President after the CAB rejected an extension of a grace period (which expired on January 26) it granted to Emirates at the end of last year.\n\nThe progress towards the AEC is going to put stress on the Philippines' infrastructure, and competitive stress on its airlines. Even under a realistically conservative scenario, AEC-related measures in the run up to the December 31 deadline and beyond are going to increase air traffic; the country on the whole is not at all prepared for it, which is probably why, even though the CAB is holding air service talks with Singapore this week and is planning talks with the United Arab Emirates as well, the government is sounding a distinctly protectionist note.\n\nThat effort is futile; the Philippines is going to be dragged into the regional competitive environment for the air transport sector whether it likes it or not. For one thing, the recent high-profile crashes of two Malaysia Airlines flights and the aforementioned AirAsia plane have probably guaranteed that work towards creating harmonized standards and an integrated Asean-wide air traffic control system will be accelerated. Reciprocity in access, already a concept the Philippines struggles with, is going to become even more exacting. If the Philippines is unwilling or unable to get with the program, it is going to find itself at a grave disadvantage in the regional market.", "SEATTLE (Reuters) - The aerospace industry is shifting more manufacturing investment to the United States after a decade in which production jobs in the sector flowed to China and other emerging economies, according to a new study.\n\nConsultancy ICF International analyzed more than 2,000 investment transactions made since 2000, and found 28 manufacturing investments in the United States from 2012 to 2013, compared with eight each in China and Mexico, and four in Brazil.

Translation by Julie Barlow.\n\nBombardier founder and former chairman Laurent Beaudoin. (Graham Hughes/CP)\n\nSkies are looking cloudy for Canadian aerospace and transportation giant Bombardier. On Thursday, the company announced the appointment of a new CEO, while delivering news of $1.2 billion in losses in 2014, and its $2.1 billion re-financing plan. The company is even considering closing divisions to reduce its debt.\n\nBut the news getting the most attention is the appointment of Alain Bellemare as Bombardier's new president and chief executive officer. Bellemare will replace Pierre Beaudoin, CEO since 2008 and son of Bombardier founder Laurent Beaudoin.\n\nBombardier's shares fell 67% under Pierre Beaudoin. Troubles have been brewing in recent years due to difficulties with Bombardier's new family of commercial jets, the CSeries. The program was delayed four times and is now two years behind schedule, increasing costs and delaying revenues.\n\nIt's a huge thorn in Bombardier's side. The delays are draining cash flow and probably explain Bombardier's decision, announced a few weeks ago, to put its Learjet program on ice. That forced Bombardier to record a pre-tax special charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 of approximately $1.4 billion.\n\nUntil the end of January, Alain Bellemare was former chief executive at United Technologies Corp. in Connecticut where he oversaw the Pratt & Whitney division.\n\nAlain Bellemare is a francophone Quebecker, with a degree in engineering from the University of Sherbrooke, an MBA from McGill university and a diploma from France's National Higher School of aeronautical constructions (ENSICA). By a happy coincidence, he left his job at UT just a few days ago, following the reorganization after the departure of UT's Canadian CEO, Louis Ch\u00eanevert.\n\nBellemare knows the aviation world well. At Pratt & Whitney, he supervised development of the engine motors Bombardier is using for the CSeries. His sudden availability may have influenced the decision to shift Pierre to the chairmanship and his father Laurent to President Emeritus.\n\nLaurent Beaudoin will have spent half a century at the helm of Bombardier. Under his leadership, Bombardier grew from a small snowmobile manufacturer into one of the giants of Canadian industry, with 74,000 employees in 60 countries and sales of 20 billion dollars.If Laurent Beaudoin was a professional athlete, he would be inducted into the Hall of Fame right now.\n\nDownload NextIssue today to get Canadian Business on your tablet -- along with Forbes, Fast Company, Wired and 100+ more of the world's best magazines -- all for one low price! Start your 30-day free trial right now!\n\nBut Bombardier's new president is facing an uphill battle.\n\nThe new CEO has to come up with enough capital to make sure Bombardier can get through the next few months. And while he's at it, he has to make sure the new CSeries jet gets certified. Bellemare has to win the favour of airlines, get the CSeries into production, fill his order books in the aviation and rail transport sectors and reassure markets that have lost confidence in his company.\n\nIt's not going to be easy.\n\nThe plane and train manufacturer is not about to crash, but Bombardier's control panel is making shareholders nervous. The available short-term capital resources Bombardier needs to stay in the air fell by a billion dollars at the end of the last fiscal year, to 3.8 billion dollars.\n\nThe company is burning a lot of money, and there are fears it won't have enough fuel to make it to its final destination: getting the CSeries into production and securing a revenue stream.\n\nThe company claims there's nothing to worry about. But the announcement of a refinancing plan of up to 2.1 billion dollars (including 1.5 billion refinancing debt and 600 million dollars from issuing new shares), along with suspension of dividends to shareholders, is making financial analysts' concerns look justified.\n\nAlain Bellemare now has to convince lenders to advance capital at a reasonable rate in spite of Bombardier's difficulties. And it won't be easy to sell new shares with falling stock prices. Shares fell 15% within hours of the announcement of Bellemare's appointment as CEO, after weeks of declining prices.\n\nBombardier says it will not try to refinance on the market unless the conditions are right. If they're not, the company might have to shut down one, or even hundreds of its divisions.\n\nThe best way for Bombardier to avoid dramatic scenarios will be to make sure the CSeries gets certified by the end of the year, as expected. Flight tests so far have had good results. As of February 10, the SC100, the smallest plane in the series, had registered 967 flight hours. The inaugural flight of the SC300 is scheduled for the end of March.\n\nThis good news should help boost Bombardier's sales. The company is aiming to sell 300 aircraft before entry-into-service, though only 243 sales have been finalized. Airbus, in comparison, has sold 4000 of the A320neo planes that compete for the same market. Last week, Air Canada announced it was buying 61 Boeing 737 Max planes, the new repowered version of its popular model, also a competitor of the CSeries.\n\nIn short, the battle's not over for Bombardier, especially given that the airplanes are not even in production yet.\n\nThe scenario would not be as disastrous if Bombardier's Learjet 85 program hadn't been put on hold. Sales in the aeronautic sector increased 11.9% in 2014, to $10.5 billion.

Out went the CEO, Pierre Beaudoin, along with the dividend. In came a commitment to pour more debt onto a company already drowning in debt.\n\nThe shares plunged, taking their one-month loss to more than 30 per cent and their five-year loss to a cruel 50 per cent. Surely this was a company in distress and companies in distress often seek saviours. Is Bombardier a goner as an independent aerospace and train company? Certainly, the official statement that Bombardier would explore various initiatives, including \"potential participation in industry consolidation,\" raised suspicions.\n\nBombardier is Canada's premier technology company, which, sadly, isn't saying a lot after nearly two decades of corporate blowups, foreign takeovers and grind-downs that eliminated Nortel and turned once-mighty BlackBerry, whose market value at its peak was more than 15 times greater than Bombardier's today, into a fringe player. Tech wasn't alone. Entire Canadian industries - steel, brewing, mining, forestry - got hollowed out, leaving a few sorry subsidiaries behind. Today, the biggies in Corporate Canada are largely limited to the five banks, a couple of insurers, gold companies and energy names such as Suncor and TransCanada.\n\nBombardier still stands proud amid the diminished ranks. It is the world's third-biggest aerospace company and invented a whole new category of plane - the regional jet - that is the equivalent of a flying minivan. Its private jets are the toys of choice for the Fortune 500 set. Its fire-fighting aircraft, which look like Second World War bombers painted yellow, are terrific global ambassadors (the ones in Italy and elsewhere are known as Canadairs). Bombardier Transportation, as the train division is called, is (barely) the top name in the industry and its high-speed trains are marvels. With a little help from taxpayers, the company takes big risks as big companies should if they want to build a future instead of resting on their laurels, doling out dividends to pensioners. The long delayed C Series jet is the biggest risk Bombardier has taken and could make or break the aerospace division.\n\nThe bad news is that Bombardier is starting to look like more victim than victor. The long-delayed C Series has, so far, been a sales disappointment and its costs have climbed 29 per cent, to $5.9-billion (U.S.), above last year's estimate. Bombardier wholly miscalculated the competitive response from Airbus and Boeing, which are in no mood to let the upstart Canadians bite into their bread-and-butter Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 market. The ambitious Learjet 85 business jet development project was dropped. The train division is feeling the heat from formidable European and Asian competitors.\n\nWith development costs soaring, debt has climbed to a fearsome $7.4-billion. The loss in the fourth quarter was $1.6-billion, mostly due to the ending of the Learjet 85 program. High cash burn meant the dividend had to be sacrificed and Bombardier is going cap in hand to shareholders for $600-million in new equity. It has all been too much pain for shareholders and Mr. Beaudoin is handing the control stick to Alain Bellemare, the former boss of the propulsion and aerospace business of United Technologies, the U.S. tech giant that makes the Pratt & Whitney engines used in the C Series. Mr. Beaudoin becomes executive chairman of the family controlled company, where he will direct overall strategy, including mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAlready, speculation is rife that he and the Bombardier family members will explore the sale of the company, in whole or in parts, on the theory that Bombardier may already have lost the war with Boeing and Airbus and may lose the train war to the Chinese, who have apparently made global train domination their goal. In December, the two train giants controlled by the Chinese state, CSR and CNR, agreed to merge. Since cash-strapped, austerity-minded state and municipal governments are the main train customers, the relatively cheap prices that CSRC/CNR can offer is bound to attract customers everywhere. CNR has already found an American customer.\n\nMy own view is that Bombardier will not break the company up and sell the aerospace side to, say, Boeing, and the train side to a competitor such as Germany's Siemens. While planes and trains offer little industrial synergy, there is a lot of financial synergy. Capital-intensive manufacturers that live and die on innovation need the vast financial resources that come with sheer bulk. That's not just because of the hefty development costs for any big project, but because the banks have to guarantee warranty and penalty costs. The bank guarantee would kick in, for example, if Bombardier were required to pay a penalty for the delayed delivery of an airplane or train.\n\nKeeping planes and trains together also makes sense because of the down payment system for each. Planes are generally paid for upon delivery, whereas train orders demand somewhere between a third and half the payment up front. This allows the cash flow from train orders to subsidize aircraft development costs. Barring a breakup, the options are the outright sale of the whole company or a series of joint ventures. The latter has enormous attractions and is already used by Bombardier to some degree. The JVs, as they're called, might see entire planes and train systems manufactured in, say, China, India or Brazil. Cheaper labour costs are not the only attraction; it's market access. If you want to sell in China, you have to build in China. Under this scenario, Bombardier's Montreal operations would evolve into a commercial business charged with development, financing and marketing, while the JVs would do the grunt work on the assembly lines.\n\nAn outright sale seems unlikely in the next few years. The C Series jet could still be a winner and a JV strategy could open up new markets. The Bombardiers and Beaudoins are industrialists, not coupon clippers, and would be loath to sell. But if Bombardier cannot revive itself, however slowly, they would certainly act rationally and get out. Were that to happen, the Canadian tech sector would be a wasteland.", "Dubai: Emirates Group is hiring more than 11,000 additional employees in the coming year as it gears up for an expansion drive and prepares to receive 20 new aircraft over the next few months.\n\nHihglighting its growth plans, the company that runs Emirates Airline and dnata announced on Tuesday that the massive hiring will increase its staff size by six per cent by March next year.\n\nHalf of the new recruits will work as cabin crew, to be based out of Dubai.

Its underlying pretax profit was down 8% to GBP1.62 billion from GBP1.76 billion last year. In October, issuing a warning on its revenue outlook for the year, Rolls had said it expected its underlying pretax profit for the year to be flat.\n\nThe reported pretax profit was driven lower by a big rise in financing costs over the year, up to GBP1.3 billion from GBP114 million last year, along with the impact of lower revenue.\n\nReported revenue for the year declined to GBP13.74 billion from GBP14.64 billion in 2013, hit by a decline in defence spending by governments in many countries and a weaker performance from its land and sea business, owing to weaker end markets. The drop was partially offset by growth in Rolls-Royce's Civil Aerospace business and by an improvement in its Defence aerospace services unit.\n\nUnderlying revenue for the year was down 6% to GBP14.59 billion, from GBP15.51 billion a year earlier. The drop was worse than the 3.5% to 4% decline in underlying revenue Rolls-Royce said it expected in October.\n\nThe group's underlying results strip out the impact of currency translation.\n\nAlong with the revenue decline this year, the group provided guidance on its 2015 performance, with underlying revenue expected to be broadly flat year-on-year at GBP13.4 billion to GBP14.4 million. It expects its underlying pretax profit for 2015 to be GBP1.4 billion to GBP1.55 billion. The guidance does not include the effect of currency translation.\n\nIn its revenue warning in October, Rolls-Royce had rolled back its statement in its 2013 full-year results, reported in February last year, that it expects growth to resume in 2015. On Friday, it further pulled back on any optimism for the coming year, saying the conditions in some of it major markets have deteriorated and noting the drop in the oil price is creating increased uncertainty for some of its customers, particularly in its Marine Offshore business.\n\nIt expects its earnings in 2015 to be weighted towards the second half, as happened in 2014, with a higher research and development charge to be booked in the first half but Civil Aerospace deliveries to be weighted to the second.\n\nIt also expects near-term headwinds to its cash position as it invests in the doubling of Trent engine deliveries. Full-year free cash flow for 2015 will be impacted by cash costs involved in its restructuring programmes, including the plan announced in November to cut 2,600 jobs over the next 18 months, and due to higher working capital requirements as engine volumes ramp up.\n\nFree cash flow fell to GBP254 million in 2014, substantially down on the GBP781 million reported last year, owing to lower volumes and lower deposits in its Civil, Marine and Defence businesses.\n\nRolls-Royce said its total payout to shareholders for the year was 23.1 pence, up on the 22 pence paid last year.\n\nThe group's Aerospace business put in a mixed performance, with underlying revenue in the Civil Aerospace business rising slightly on the back of Trent engine orders, but the performance of its Defence arm suffering from a slowdown in orders.\n\nRolls-Royce's order book at year-end was up 5% to GBP73.7 billion, boosted by increases in the Civil Aerospace, Defence Aerospace and Power Systems businesses.\n\nThe Civil Aerospace order book increased by 5% in the year, boosted by a series of orders for its Trent engine range, including GBP4.5 billion in orders for Trent 7000 engines and TotalCare service orders for Airbus A330neo planes.\n\nUnderlying Civil Aerospace revenue was up 3%, with 8% growth in original equipment sales but a 1% decline in services revenue. The original equipment performance was driven by a ramp-up in Trent 1000 engine production, Rolls-Royce said, though this was offset by a 9% drop in business jet engine deliveries.\n\nBut the performance in the Civil Aerospace division was offset by weakness in its Defence Aerospace arm, where underlying revenue dropped by 20% to GBP2.07 billion. The drop was driven by a 41% fall in underlying original equipment revenue over the year, hit by lower volumes across several work programmes, including major deliveries in 2013 for two export contracts which were close to completion in Saudi Arabia and India.\n\nUnderlying profit in the Defence arm was down 16%, with the decline in revenue somewhat offset by cost cutting and a favourable mix towards aftermarket sales.\n\nWithin its Land & Sea business, Rolls-Royce reported weaker revenue in its Power Systems and Marine business but an improvement in its Nuclear business, excluding the unit it has sold to Germany's Siemens AG.\n\nPower Systems underlying revenue was pulled down 4%, primarily due to currency translation impacts. Growth in its defence and power generation segments within the division was offset by substantially lower sales to European construction, industrial and agricultural customers. Marine revenue in the Power Systems unit also fell, down due to weaker yacht markets.\n\nUnderlying revenue in the Marine business was dragged lower by 16%, partially due to currency translation but also due to a 17% fall in original equipment sales and a 15% drop in services revenue. The original equipment sales were pulled lower by weaker pricing and an anticipated decline in offshore, resulting from the weak order intake in 2013. Service revenue came down as shipowners deferred overhaul and maintenance spending decisions.\n\nUnderlying revenue in Rolls-Royce's Nuclear business, excluding the energy gas turbines and gas compressor business sold to Siemens last year, rose 3%, driven by growth in its Civil Nuclear service business. Including the business it has sold to Siemens, underlying revenue fell 8% to GBP1.41 billion.\n\n\"2014 has been a mixed year during which underlying revenue fell for the first time in a decade, reflecting reduced spending by our defence customers, macroeconomic uncertainty, and falling commodity prices,\" Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rishton said.\n\nInvestec said the results were broadly in line with consensus and with its forecasts and said the midpoint of Rolls-Royce's 2015 profit guidance is broadly in line with the market view, which should provide some reassurance.\n\nFollowing 2014, however, investors are likely to be cautious on the company, the broker said. It said it expects the focus to shift rapidly to 2016, where Rolls will continue to face the same headwinds to its business, and Investec reckons a continued drag on its performance by non-aerospace units will serve a catalyst for a strategic review.\n\nInvestec has put its recommendation and price target on the stock under review, having previously had a Hold review and 860 pence price target.\n\nBy Sam Unsted; samunsted@alliancenews.com; @SamUAtAlliance\n\nCopyright 2015 Alliance News Limited.

($1=0.6491 pounds) (Editing by Susan Thomas and Greg Mahlich)", "By Robert Wall\n\nLONDON-- Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC has again cut its profit forecast for the year as the British engineering group struggles to get to grips with turbulent trading conditions that contributed to a sharp drop in profit for 2014.\n\nThe engine maker said on Friday that it barely broke even last year, reporting full-year net profit of GBP69 million ($106.1 million) compared with GBP1.37 billion in the previous year on a 6.1% fall in revenue to GBP13.74 billion.\n\nRolls-Royce had \"a mixed year during which underlying revenue fell for the first time in a decade, reflecting reduced spending by our defense customers, macroeconomic uncertainty, and falling commodity prices,\" said Chief Executive John Rishton.\n\nThe sharp drop in net profit reflects the revaluation of its currency hedging, Chief Financial Officer David Smith said. The more closely watched underlying pretax profit figure, which excludes changes in the value of currency hedges, was GBP1.62 billion, down 8% from the previous year.\n\nRolls-Royce said underlying pretax profit this year could fall as much as 14% to between GBP1.4 billion and GBP1.55 billion, worse than it had forecast as recently as last October.\n\nManagement blamed the sharp fall in oil prices, down around 50% from last summer, for the downgraded outlook. \"In October we started to see oil prices coming down but not half as much as we've seen since then,\" Mr. Rishton said.\n\nFalling crude prices have proved a particularly headache for Rolls-Royce's marine engine business, dependent on custom from ship builders supplying the oil and gas sector. Profit at the ship engine division could fall to GBP90 million from GBP138 million last year, excluding currency fluctuations, the company said.\n\nRolls-Royce's civil aerospace activities, the group's largest profit contributor, are also under pressure, with the unit expected to return GBP800 million to GBP900 million in pretax profit, down from GBP942 million last year. The decline partly reflects a rise in new engine deliveries which are less profitable than the division's repair and maintenance business.\n\nThough oil prices are weighing on near-term earnings, Mr. Rishton said they should be good for the company over a longer period by aiding global growth.\n\nMr. Rishton also said the company is pressing ahead with efforts to boost profitability after the group's operating-profit margin slipped to 11.5% last year.\n\nRolls-Royce has struggled to meet earnings targets--a year ago it forecast sales and earnings growth for 2015--as cost cutting at its aerospace unit, the company's largest division, fell short.\n\nThe company has announced it would cut 2,600 jobs. Mr. Rishton said 545 employees had left last year on a voluntary basis with most of the rest of the departures expected this year. Reductions are being made in the land and sea activities through a series of smaller measures, he said.\n\nThe possible rise in sales this year is linked to increased output of long-range jetliners at Boeing Co. and Airbus Group NV. Rolls-Royce builds engines for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and has makes the only turbine for the rival Airbus A350 that entered service last month at Qatar Airways. Sales in civil aerospace should rise to at least GBP7 billion from GBP6.8 billion.\n\nMr. Smith said costs to build the engine for the A350 are coming down as planned. Rolls-Royce also said earnings this year won't be affected by any further Airbus productions cuts for its A330 jetliner. Airbus in December said it may curtail production amid weak demand for the current version. Rolls-Royce builds one of the types of engines used on the widebody jet.\n\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=GB00B63H8491\n\nAccess Investor Kit for The Boeing Co.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0970231058\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US7757812067\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-13-150526ET Copyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines\n\nReferenced Stocks: BA , RYCEY", "SEATTLE: Stelia Aerospace, a large maker of commercial aircraft structures and components, is considering putting a production facility in the United States to be closer to customers and increase its purchases in dollars, a senior executive said on Thursday.\n\nStelia, formed last month from the merger of Airbus subsidiaries Aerolia and Sogerma, is considering aircraft seat production in the United States, among other options, Francis Archambault, director of business development at Stelia, said at an industry conference near Seattle. The planning is preliminary and no time frame has been set, he said.\n\nStelia, which makes business and first-class seats, large aircraft structures and equipment, said European aerospace suppliers are well-prepared to meet single-aisle aircraft production at Airbus's targeted rate of 46 a month in 2016.\n\n\"The job was very well done in terms of building capacity for this ramp-up,\" Archambault said at the conference, organized by the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance.\n\nBoeing Co plans to increase output of its rival 737 jet to 52 a month in 2018, from 42 a month currently.\n\nArchambault would not comment on the capacity of the European suppliers to support higher rates at Airbus.\n\nStelia aims to increase its purchasing in dollars toward 50 percent, Archambault said. Dollar-denominated purchases at the combined group have increased to 34 percent from 17 percent five years ago, he said. Dollar-denominated purchases help hedge against currency swings, because commercial aircraft are priced in dollars.\n\nStelia is looking across the United States for a possible plant location, using an analysis Airbus performed when it placed an aircraft assembly line in Alabama. That factory is due to produce its first airplane next year, for JetBlue Airways.\n\nThe Stelia investment, if it comes, would be in line with significant growth in aerospace manufacturers in the United States since 2013.\n\nStelia also has sizable manufacturing operations in Morocco and Tunisia, and that is another growth area for investment, Archambault said.

That is why you will often see business jets have a neutral colour cabin. Beige is very widespread. Because the smarter customers are thinking ahead to that one day they will sell it.\"\n\nSince the mid-1980s Airbus has sold 170 corporate jets, which are modified versions of the same A320 and A330 family aircraft flown by commercial airlines. The customer base is relatively evenly split between individuals, companies and governments. The individual market for the jets, which compete against offerings from Boeing, Gulfstream and Bombardier is comprised of a single demographic: billionaires.\n\nThe top markets for Airbus include China, the Middle East and Russia. It has yet to sell any of its corporate jets to individuals in Australia, although politician Clive Palmer, miner Gina Rinehart and logistics king Lindsay Fox own models by other manufacturers.\n\nAirbus and rival Boeing dominate the upper-end of the private jet spectrum. Buying these aircraft is a very time-consuming proposition. Mr Velupillai said if a customer ordered one immediately, a narrowbody ACJ319 - a modified version of the A319 used by airlines - would not be delivered for another 18 months to two years. A widebody ACJ330, which could fly to Los Angeles or Dubai non-stop from Sydney, would not be delivered for two to two and a half years.\n\nAirbus has introduced special interiors packages for the time-poor billionaire that does not want every little item on the jet to be customised. But for those that want a fully customised luxurious plane, almost any request can be fulfilled, whether it be gold-plated taps in the bathroom or extremely rare leather.\n\n\"The lead time for that leather is the time it takes for a cow to be born,\" Mr Velupillai said of that bespoke request. \"It comes from a special part of the Pyrenees. This special part of the Pyrenees is an area where there aren't any brambles and things that can tear the skin of the cow so you get a nice piece of leather. So people go to incredible lengths to get that kind of stuff.\"\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the private jets don't tend to contain anything more exotic than a bedroom, shower or bar. \"These customers are not looking for the exotic,\" Mr Velupillai said. \"They are not looking for saunas and gyms. They are looking for a way to take their lifestyle on the ground into the air. They are looking to take their luxury apartment or their luxury villa into the air. They are looking to take their office into the air.\"\n\nThere are, however, certain special considerations that must be made due to the unique environment which requires all of the cabin interiors receive certification from regulators. Lighter materials are better because they will reduce fuel burn and give the aircraft a greater range. The materials should not be able to burn easily or produce toxic emissions in the unlikely event of a crash landing.The centre of gravity is also important to ensure the aircraft can fly safely.\n\nAnd just as consumer confidence affects whether middle-class consumers feel comfortable buying a car or house, it also can be an important factor in the private jet market. \"Just like you and I who are nervous about spending money when things are a little uncertain, you could see a billionaire doing the same thing, saying 'I'll keep my existing jet for a couple of years until things have settled down,'\" Mr Velupillai said.", "CONNECT 29 TWEET 10 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nPARIS -- Airbus Helicopters last month submitted its offer in Poland's tender for 70 military multirole helicopters and expects a short list to be selected in February, Chairman Guillaume Faury said Tuesday.\n\nThe Polish competition is a \"strategic opportunity\" and Airbus has \"good chances,\" Faury told journalists at the New Year's press conference.\n\nAirbus Helicopters has pitched its EC725 Caracal against the Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk and AgustaWestland AW149.

Since Boeing (NYSE: BA) started 787 production in North Charleston in 2011, groups from the region have been trying to lure investment from aerospace suppliers with limited success.\n\nThe Florida group isn't trying to woo suppliers away from Washington state, but rather to encourage them to consider Florida's industrial panhandle if they're thinking of opening a branch in the South, Gardner said. He's also an economic representative of PowerSouth, a regional energy cooperative.\n\nFrom Gardner's viewpoint, the northwest of Florida is becoming the new epicenter of aircraft manufacturing.\n\nWhen Airbus' new A320 plant starts operations in 2016, the Florida panhandle will be bracketed by five aircraft manufacturers: Airbus an hour to the west, Boeing Charleston six hours to the north, and one Gulfstream and two Embraer factories, two hours east.\n\nSteve Wilhelm covers manufacturing, aerospace and trade for the Puget Sound Business Journal.", "The annual aircraft industry conference in Lynnwood, Wash., got off to a roaring start on Wednesday when an aircraft industry analyst suggested that Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) might resurrect its 757 single-aisle, twin-engine jet by putting new engines on the plane. A Boeing executive rejected that idea later in the day. Boeing has consistently denied that it will put new engines on the 757.\n\nSo what will Boeing do? According to Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president for marketing in its commercial planes division, the company is working on its plans for a replacement for the 757, but that reaching a decision will take some time.\n\nTinseth said that there are still about 950 757s in use, of which about 750 are passenger planes and the rest are freighters. According to a report from industry consulting firm Leeham, Tinseth gave a \"very firm 'No'\" to putting a new engine on the 757 frame.\n\nThe 757 fills a niche in the airlines business that is not as large as that of the single-aisle 737 and the Airbus A320, but Boeing now trails Airbus in orders for the smaller planes, and Boeing wins in the dual-aisle, wide-body space. The 757 fits between these two larger spaces and has the capability to fly into and out of smaller airports with shorter runways and to serve high-altitude airports. The plane is also capable of flying so-called long-thin routes -- long distances with around 200 passengers.\n\nALSO READ: Boeing to Build the Next Air Force One\n\nAirbus has announced an A321LR (long range) to fill this niche. The plane is essentially an A321neo (new engine option) with a standard configuration of 16 business class seats and 190 economy class seats. Added fuel tanks give the plane a claimed range of 4,000 nautical miles. The longest commercial flight currently flown by the 757 connects New York non-stop with Berlin, which is slightly more than 4,000 nautical miles. The 757 can only fly this far with fewer passengers.\n\nBoeing will do something in this niche because it must. In Thursday's conference sessions, industry analyst Richard Aboulafia -- who brought up the 757 issue -- also said that Airbus would hold 60% of the market for single-aisle planes through 2024. The market is currently almost equally divided between Boeing and Airbus, and Boeing's Tinseth said he does not agree that Airbus will dominate that market.\n\nBut Airbus could, and that is why Boeing needs to do something to counter the A321LR and keep a Boeing plane as at least an equal player in the 757's niche. It doesn't look like it can be done cheaply, though, and that is what bothers Boeing.\n\nBoeing's stock traded down fractionally at $147.87 Thursday morning, in a 52-week range of $116.32 to $148.89.\n\nALSO READ: Boeing's 777X Wing Plant Sprouts Steel\n\nBy Paul Ausick", "CONNECT 29 TWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nPARIS -- The key role of military helicopters in underpinning French national security was highlighted in the police assault on the two brothers who killed the journalists at the Charlie Hebdo weekly, with four helicopters assigned to the deadly task.\n\n\"The helicopters were up close to the action,\" Army Gen. Olivier Gourlez de la Motte, chief of the Army Air Corps, said Jan. 22. Three Army Pumas and one from the Air Force were committed, with one of those on standby, he said.\n\nThree helicopters flew to Dammartin-en-Go\u00eble, the village where the killers Ch\u00e9rif and Sa\u00efd Kouachi had gone into hiding in a small print company and seized its owner as hostage. The fourth helicopter served as a back-up unit at the Villacoublay military base on the edge of the capital.\n\nThe helicopters flew in officers of the \u00e9lite paramilitary unit Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale who were attached to a rope beneath the helicopter on the special patrol insertion/extraction system.\n\nThe pilots also flew reconnaissance flights over the key site.\n\nThe top priority placed on domestic security will slow the government's response to a request for 10 or so attack and transport helicopters to reinforce the Barkhane operation in the Sahel sub-Saharan region.\n\n\"This evening, there is a theater on which I would like to insist, because it is at an unprecedented level,\" Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Jan. 22. \"It is of course the national theater.\" The minister was speaking before service chiefs, industry leaders, politicians and foreign diplomatic officers at the New Year's reception at the Naval Museum.\n\nThe French forces have asked for more helicopters to boost the 20 or so choppers flying in the Barkhane mission, de la Motte said Jan. 9.\n\nSome 15 helicopters are on stand-by for domestic missions, and the administration could send these to Africa for a three-month deployment, he said.\n\nFrance launched the Barkhane operation last year, aimed at countering Islamist insurgents. France signed up Burkino Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger as partners, and the African nations are bases for some 3,000 French troops in the region.\n\n\"The target is to rise in strength,\" de La Motte told the defense journalists association. \"Today we have around a dozen helicopters in Gao, and between eight and 10 for the special forces. The goal is to add 10 more,\" he said. Gao is a French military base in Mali.\n\nThe aim is \"to have a real helicopter force for Barkhane,\" he said. The extra units would be a mix of Tiger and Gazelle combat, and Puma and Cougar transport helicopters.\n\nArmy planners have asked for six Tiger helicopters deployed in 2015, he said. At Gao, there are presently three Tigers in the h\u00e9licopter appui et protection, or lighter, version, under Barkhane command.\n\nThere are also two of the heavier h\u00e9licopter appui et destruction (HAD), or support and attack models, based in Central African Republic under the Sangaris operation. These Tigers fly from the base at Bangui.\n\nHAD Tigers are armed with laser-guided Hellfire II missiles and have a more powerful engine.\n\nAirbus Helicopter on Dec. 10 delivered the first two of the HAD Block 2 version to the French Army. The Block 2 has an improved targeting system and additional combat external fuel tanks, Airbus Helicopters said in a statement.\n\nThe helicopters are needed to help control the territory and to launch attack missions, de la Motte said.\n\nThe crews have built up a wide range of experience, having flown over Afghan mountains, in urban combat in the Ivory Coast, night missions in Libya and the more recent operations in Africa.\n\nIn the allied air operations in Libya, Tiger and Gazelle crews flew night missions from the Mistral helicopter carriers and operated under the \"kill box\" approach, which affords great autonomy to hit targets.\n\nThe US, UK and France equip fleets with attack and transport helicopters on a 50:50 basis, while most forces fly more of the latter type, de la Motte said.\n\nAt an international forum in Dakar, Senegal, Dec. 16, Le Drian said, \"military action is indispensable but it is not enough on its own.\" Military is important but governance, development aid and economic growth are also crucial, he said.\n\n\"A lasting security can only come from combining these different factors,\" he said at the closing of the two-day conference.\n\nFrench military intervention defeated advancing insurgents in Mali and prevented a civilian massacre in CAR, he said.\n\nEmail: ptran@defensenews.com.\n\nCONNECT 29 TWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/strike/2015/01/23/france-helicopters-hebdo-police-africa-mali-islamist-barkhane-le-drian/22211785/", "* First sale worth more than 5 billion euros (Recasts with Hollande confirmation)\n\nBy Julien Ponthus and John Irish\n\nBRUSSELS, Feb 12 (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande said Egypt would order 24 Rafale fighter jets, a naval frigate and related military equipment in a deal to be signed in Cairo on Monday worth more than 5 billion euros ($5.70 billion).\n\nThe contract would make Egypt, aiming to upgrade its military hardware amid fears the crisis in neighbouring Libya could spill over, the first export customer for the warplane, built by Dassault Aviation.\n\nIt follows years of failed attempts by France to export the plane.\n\n\"The Rafale fighter jet has won its first export contract,\" Hollande's office said in a statement.\n\n\"The Egyptian authorities have just let me know their intention of acquiring 24 Rafale planes, a multi-mission frigate as well as related equipment.\" The latter items consist of a Fremm warship and MBDA air-to-air missiles.\n\nHollande, in Brussels for a European Council meeting, added that the sale accord would be signed in Cairo on Monday by Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nThe contract would be the first overseas for the Rafale, 14 years after it entered service and three years after Dassault Aviation entered exclusive negotiations to sell 126 of the combat jets to India.\n\nDelays in finalising the Indian contract are expected to be discussed at a major Indian air show starting on Feb. 18.\n\nDassault is also in negotiations to supply the Rafale to Qatar and under increasing pressure to sell the plane overseas.\n\nThe French government said last year it would slow the pace at which it takes delivery of Rafale jets, to just 26 over the next five years instead of 11 a year.\n\nParis and Cairo have enjoyed close economic ties in the past but turmoil in the north African state since President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown in 2011 left Western governments wary of signing deals, especially in defence.\n\nWith the rise to power of Sisi, ties have improved.

Dollar-denominated purchases at the combined group have increased to 34 percent from 17 percent five years ago, he said. Dollar-denominated purchases help hedge against currency swings, because commercial aircraft are priced in dollars.\n\nStelia is looking across the United States for a possible plant location, using an analysis Airbus performed when it placed an aircraft assembly line in Alabama. That factory is due to produce its first airplane next year, for JetBlue Airways .\n\nThe Stelia investment, if it comes, would be in line with significant growth in aerospace manufacturers in the United States since 2013.\n\nStelia also has sizable manufacturing operations in Morocco and Tunisia, and that is another growth area for investment, Archambault said.

The family said it has no plans to give up control through its current dual-class share structure - a system that has been \"a strength\" in tough times, Mr. Beaudoin said.\n\nAs executive chairman, Mr. Beaudoin will take over responsibility for mergers and acquisitions as well as financing, he said, allowing Mr. Bellemare to focus on operations and execution.\n\nBombardier has been down this road before, hiring outsider Paul Tellier as CEO a decade ago to lead a turnaround at that time. His tenure lasted less than two years.\n\nMr. Beaudoin moved into the corner office in June, 2008. Marked by delays and earnings misses, his six-year reign saw the company's stock fall by 70 per cent as concerns mounted over the company's future.\n\nHe delayed the C Series program at least four times, giving rivals Boeing and Airbus the chance to develop competing jets. He also made downward revisions to profit guidance twice over the past year alone.\n\n\"It hasn't worked out\" for shareholders under Mr. Beaudoin's tenure but it's not yet finished, said Ernie Arvai with boutique U.S. consultancy AirInsight. \"They've bet the company on the C Series.

Its corporate jet business is slipping from a lack of orders. Commercial aircraft is waiting for a revenue jump from the C Series.

Bombardier wasn't formally looking for a replacement but when Mr. Bellemare became available, it was an opportunistic talent grab, the source said. Mr. Bellemare had just left United Technologies Corp. when Pierre Beaudoin called.\n\n\"I knew he could execute very well,\" said Mr. Beaudoin, who's known Mr. Bellemare for about 20 years. \"It's an opportunity I took when Alain became available.\"\n\nVeritas analyst Mr. Scilipoti said he believes Bombardier is at a crossroads, and could parcel off its train business as it re-evaluates its priorities after a weak performance over the past two years in particular.\n\n\"They've got to now decide what they're going to do as a business. Because they can't do everything.\"\n\nHaving sold the businesses that don't make up an obvious core part of Bombardier's strategy, like its military aviation training unit, Mr. Beaudoin now intends to turn his attention to examining the possibility of more formal commercial partnerships.

It was not an option; it was an obligation.\n\nIn the periods of my career when I stopped passing the ball forward, or when I stopped looking for the risky pass that might open up a defence, the consequences were the same. The manager stopped picking me. I got back into the team when I went back to doing it the way he wanted.\n\nUnited's history was built on attacking football, which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances. Why do you think United have had some of the best goalkeepers in the world over the years? They needed them because the team committed so many players forward.\n\nIt does not give me any pleasure to say that at the moment I am struggling to watch Louis van Gaal's team with any great enjoyment. They beat Burnley on Wednesday night but it was Burnley who had by far the best of the first half. At times, United's football is miserable. To beat opposing teams you have to attack, and to attack you have to take risks. Too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks.\n\nAs a midfielder at United I had to pass the ball forward and, yes, it did not always work. It did not always mean putting a chance on a plate for the strikers. It was up to them to get on the ball and score goals. Was it easy? No, but we were playing for United. It was not supposed to be easy.\n\nOf the current team, Angel Di Maria has taken more risks than any other player and, unfortunately, for him it has not worked out. He has given the ball away a lot for very little returns. Otherwise there seems to be an emphasis on possession. I would go further than that: there is an obsession with possession.\n\nUnited fans don't care if the team only has 40 per cent possession as long as they are watching an attacking team. My experience was that the supporters understood that even our best teams, even the teams with Peter Schmeichel or Edwin van der Sar in goal, were going to concede goals. We were not reckless, or na\u00efve, but always the chief aim was to attack - and we backed ourselves to outscore the opposition.\n\nThis season, how many times have United been rescued by David De Gea? Without him they would be three, four places lower down the table.\n\nThough David De Gea has impressed for United this season I realise that the comparisons I am making are with a golden age in United's history and that nothing lasts for ever. I was fortunate to play with so many wonderful footballers and under the greatest manager of all time, but I do believe that a club's ethos, the principles of how it plays, should outlive even the biggest individuals in its history. United are about attacking football, and everything else has to takes its place behind that.\n\nWe come at last to the two strikers, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. I feel they look like strangers at times, while Wayne Rooney is moved around the team to accommodate them.\n\nWayne can play anywhere on the pitch. He is so willing, and he will give you at least a 7/10 performance most times. Against Burnley he ended up as a defensive midfielder. At other times he has been pushed out to the right-hand side, where he will look for the strikers early or switch the play. But if Van Gaal does not think Rooney is a better option up front than the other two then there really is a problem.\n\nAgainst Burnley Wayne Rooney ended up as a defensive midfielder He has a fantastic goalscoring record for United, behind only Sir Bobby Charlton and Denis Law, yet against West Ham he did not have a single touch in the opposition's box. That cannot be good for the team.\n\nVan Gaal has taken some criticism for his Tuesday press conference when he produced those statistical printouts to come back at Sam Allardyce over his joke that United were a long-ball team. There was part of me that was pleased to see Van Gaal show a bit of edge and take someone on. It is what we expected of him when he was appointed.\n\nEven so, I know Big Sam quite well and he had his tongue firmly in cheek when he said what he did about United. At the end of the day, all Van Gaal had to remind himself was that, for all Big Sam's qualities, we were not talking about the manager of Real Madrid or Liverpool or Bayern Munich. We were talking about West Ham. There was no need to rise to the bait.\n\nI like Pochettino. He has confidence without arrogance\n\nHis team might have lost to Liverpool on Tuesday but the more I see of Mauricio Pochettino, the more I think he is the best young coach around.\n\nWhat I like about Pochettino is the way that he looks in control. He is in control of his players, in control of the way that they play. He is confident without being arrogant and his team is playing with a great energy.\n\nHe had very little to spend in the summer and yet he improved the players that he inherited. He has a clear way of playing, the 4-2-3-1 formation, and from what I hear his squad's fitness is a major part of the way he works. In that respect he takes them right up to the limit in training and they play the same way.\n\nNot only that but he has been brave in picking younger players ahead of the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado and Paulinho. In Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason he has a very hard-working, solid midfield base. Ahead of them, the attacking three of Christian Eriksen, Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Erik Lamela are given licence to rotate positions. In Harry Kane he has found himself a great centre-forward.\n\nI recognise that Tim Sherwood gave a lot of these young players their first chance and Pochettino has shown the same faith in them. Mason and Bentaleb are both still relatively inexperienced in the Premier League, although they broke through relatively late in their careers, and at this stage they will make mistakes. They both did so against Liverpool in the first half. But they still offer a lot to the team.\n\nMason has caught my eye a lot this season. He can tackle, he is tactically disciplined and he kicks the ball cleanly with either foot. He gets about the pitch too. I understand he had a few loan spells and some injury problems before he made it as a regular with Spurs and his development has been overshadowed by Kane. But I see no reason why Mason should not be in the next senior England squad.\n\nHarry Kane has scored 23 goals for Spurs this season That brings us to Kane. You simply cannot argue with goals against teams like Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. Especially away at Liverpool. I think scoring for the away team at Anfield is still a litmus test for any striker who wants to call himself a goalscorer. Kane is not just picking up goals at home against teams in the bottom half of the table, he is scoring against the best and away from White Hart Lane too.\n\nWhat makes him special? I have said before that he does not have a standout quality but scores highly across a number of categories. The more I watch him, the more I appreciate his temperament. Playing in attack is difficult. You are under scrutiny and you have to be able to deal with that. Kane seems to do it easily.\n\nTake Tuesday night. Martin Skrtel is good at rattling the opposing centre-forward. He did it to a player as experienced as Diego Costa and got a reaction out of him. Yet Kane never reacted to Skrtel once, and never looked like doing so. Then, when the chance presented itself he was ruthless. I have said before his finishing reminds me of Ruud van Nistelrooy. The thing about Ruud was he never wanted to give the goalkeeper a sniff of saving it. Kane is the same.\n\nRyan Mason (left) has also excelled for Tottenham From the outside, Spurs have always seemed a turbulent club. They are either on Cloud Nine or near the bottom of the league. What Pochettino has brought is a calm. He has shown respect to the players he has left out and carried along with him those youngsters who broke through under Sherwood.\n\nOn top of that, I hear he takes time to watch the youth teams and the Under-21s play. I cannot tell you how important that is. Modern managers have a lot of demands on them and many feel, with justification, that they do not have the time to commit to watching the junior sides. But it makes such a difference to the mood at a club when the first-team manager knows every youngster by name. The manager I played under did.\n\nI'm sure I've called Robbie much worse down the years!\n\nI realise that my inadvertent remark on BT Sport that was picked up by the cameras has caused a fair bit of amusement. I have to be clear about one thing, the \"k***head\" comment was something of a reflex that came out because I must have been so relaxed on the Fletch and Sav sofa. In reality, I did not even realise I had said it until the presenter, Darren Fletcher, apologised on air a few minutes later.\n\nScholes (left) and Robbie Savage tussle for the ball in 2004 So let me clarify: I don't think Robbie Savage is a k***head! We have known each other since we were kids and I enjoy being on the show with him. I am sure we said much worse to each other in those Manchester United youth teams.

His contract is set to expire after the 2015-16 season but Rummenigge has said the Spaniard can stay at Bayern indefinitely should he so choose.\n\nThe manager said last month that he would not discuss an extension until the season ended, but Rummenigge said he is not overly concerned by the uncertainty surrounding Guardiola's future.\n\n\"I had a discussion with him a couple of weeks ago about this matter,\" the chairman told ESPN FC. \"The outcome of the final results of these discussions have been that I don't want to ask him within the end of this running season.

And while Rummenigge is keeping an eye on the future, he says it's not yet time to replace the current stars with younger models.\n\n\"So we have some players that are beginning with the autumn of their careers, players that are more than 30 years old. But I don't have the impression that all of them are in a critical phase,\" Rummenigge said.\n\n\"I think players like [30-year-old Bastian] Schweinsteiger, Ribery, especially Robben are still up in good conditions and doing well. When I'm watching Arjen Robben I'm still falling in love with his performance, which has been at a very high level for two years especially.\n\n\"Of course we have to care about, to find the right balance at the end. But I'm convinced there is a good chance that we will find the right balance in the end to find a good way to substitute them.\n\nAsked if he felt he would have to build a new Bayern in the coming years, the chairman said: \"That is, of course, a very important matter we have to do together with the coach, which is not easy. But I believe we are able to do so.\"\n\nRummenigge also predicted FIFA president Sepp Blatter would easily win his bid for a fifth term when elections are held in May.\n\n\"I believe the elections are done,\" he said. \"Mr Blatter is a candidate and he is by far the big favourite. He's supported by all the big continents from Africa, Asia, South America and so on.\n\n\"Maybe he will not be elected by Europeans because there are European candidates like Luis Figo and maybe Prince Ali from Jordan. But in the end I'm convinced Blatter will win by far.\n\nRummenigge said a change in FIFA leadership may not be for the best, even if prominent European federations have supported other candidates.\n\n\"I don't know if a change would be good for football because I believe, if you regard to FIFA, I know that Mr Blatter is not very popular in England, he's not very popular in Germany, but I have the impression he's very popular in Africa, Asia and South America,\" Rummenigge said. \"Maybe we have to request ourselves why FIFA is not very popular in Europe, especially in these two countries.\n\n\"So, I believe it is not very easy to always find good solutions for FIFA, which in the end are well accepted by all continents. I believe that Europe has to have a good policy regarding everything, because Europe is by far the most prominent continent, and by far the most important continent.\n\n\"To give an example, I believe that last World Cup 76 [percent] of all players playing, or who were in the squads, are contracted in Europe. That's a sign that things in Europe are well, and European football is very wealthy especially in the 'Big Five' countries.\n\n\"But that is definitely a goal to find good solidarity solutions that are accepted by all continents.

The only thing we need to grow is TV figures.\n\n\"So, in comparison to Italy and Spain, and especially England, we are far away.

Villa sits in the third relegation spot with just 22 points in 25 games. However, it is just a point from safety.\n\nSo why is Klinsmann so high up?\n\nThere's the fact that he has suffered criticism following the World Cup after a bad run of form, admittedly in friendlies. He's been vocally frustrated with players in the U.S. pool moving back to MLS rather than pushing for higher quality soccer in the top European leagues, which has led to public dust ups with MLS commissioner Don Garber. He's managed in Europe, albeit unsuccessfully, with Bayern Munich.\n\nThere's also the fact that American Randy Lerner owns Aston Villa. Connections abound!\n\nBut is there anything really to it? It seems highly unlikely.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that oddsmakers often post numbers based on how they think people will bet not necessarily how the winds are actually blowing. Klinsmann has a huge name across the world and obviously the U.S., so people may wager on him on recognition alone. Remember, he was high up on the oddsboards for the Spurs job last season.\n\nThen there's situation. Even throwing out the fact Klinsmann lives in California and has total control over the U.S. national team set up, there's also the type of job we're talking about here.\n\nYes, Aston Villa is a Premier League squad, but right now only just. The club's ownership situation with Lerner is a mess, and relegation is a strong possibility, which would leave any manager hired now on tenuous ground when the season ends. Or if Villa is actually sold at some point.\n\nIt certainly makes sense for a manager out of the game to take it, hello Sherwood, but one who has a pretty cushy job? That's another story entirely.\n\nNote that Klinsmann isn't the only former U.S. manager to be found on the oddsboard. His predecessor Bob Bradley is as low as 20-to-1 in some shops, putting him in the top 10 candidates.\n\nBradley, who is managing Staebek in the Norweigan first division and narrowly missed getting Egypt to the World Cup in 2014, previously declared interest in the Villa job when it came open in 2010. However, though Bradley did well keeping Staebeck up this season, saving a team in Norway from relegation isn't quite the same task as doing it in England.\n\nAnd just for good measure, Galaxy and former U.S. coach Bruce Arena is actually listed at many of the shops, including as low as 12-to-1 at one book. If that seems odd, considering there has been absolutely zero linking him there, it's just a reminder to take all of these numbers with a grain of salt.\n\nSo is it possible Klinsmann ends up at Villa? Sure. Is it likely?\n\nDon't bet on it.\n\nPresented by Merrill Edge Presented by Dodge Charger Kings reach agreement with George Karl to replace coach Ty...

he is very inexperienced despite his reputation.\n\nCan Villa at such a critical stage, with so much TV money at stake, afford to take such a risk?\n\nDid you know?\n\nKenny Dalglish once approached the late Blackburn Rovers owner Jack Walker to ask him to sign a young Bordeaux midfielder making waves in France.\n\nWalker dismissed the request and asked Dalglish: \"Why do I need Zinedine Zidane when I have Tim Sherwood?\"\n\nJurgen Klinsmann\n\nManagement experience\n\nJurgen Klinsmann boasts over a decade's coaching experience - even though less than a season of it was in club management.\n\nAs a player Klinsmann was a World Cup winner and European Championship winner with Germany and he took over as manager of his national team in 2004, leading them to the World Cup semi finals in 2006 and restoring the footballing feel-good factor in his homeland.\n\nDespite his positive impact on a nation feeling down from a previous tournament failure, the job took its toll on Klinsmann who decided against renewing his contract and left his post in July 2006.\n\nTwo years later he succeeded Ottmar Hitzfeld at Bayern Munich, leading them to Champions League quarter finals.\n\nThey were challenging for the Bundesliga title when he left in the closing stages of the season after a fallout with the board.\n\nSince July 2011 he has been the head coach of the Unites States national team, helping raising the standard and profile by leading them to the World Cup last 16 last summer.\n\nAvailability\n\nKlinsmann is contracted to the U.S. national team until 2018.\n\nCharisma\n\nLoads of it. Klinsmann exudes class.\n\nOn his arrival in England he was portrayed as a cheating diver.\n\nWhen he departed after a successful spell at Spurs he was highly regarded as a thoroughly nice bloke - by everyone except Alan Sugar, who when the striker left White Hart Lane that his shirt was not good enough to wash his car with.\n\nDeal-breaker\n\nHe seems to enjoy living in the States, so much so that he even commuted from the U.S. during his time in charge of Germany.\n\nVilla would need to make him quite an offer to persuade him to swap a burgeoning project and happy home life for a survival slog in Brum.\n\nAs U.S. blogger Ryan Rosenblatt put it on Stars and Stripes FC: \"There are real people in the world who think that Klinsmann would give up his home in Manhattan Beach and trade it for a home in Birmingham.\n\n\"They think he would rather manage a Premier League club on short notice that he can't buy players for in the hope of keeping them from being relegated instead of a team that he has three years invested in and three more years guaranteed.\n\n\"They think that money is unholy and want to light theirs on fire.\"", "Former FIFA referee Herbert Fandel has urged Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola to tone down his touchline behaviour or otherwise face disciplinary action.\n\nLast week, Guardiola escaped sanctions during Bayern's 1-1 draw with Schalke when he stormed out of his technical area following a controversial decision, and seconds later was seen talking to -- and also making contact with -- the assistant at the corner flag.\n\nOn his way back to the dugout, with Bayern taking the lead, the coach then embraced the fourth referee.\n\nIt was not the first time this season that Guardiola was seen talking to the fourth official, making content with them or outside the technical area.\n\nGuardiola was not sent off during the match against Schalke and Hellmut Krug, one of the two German referee bosses, said that was because \"there was no aggression involved\" during the incident at the Allianz Arena and referee Bastian Dankert was right to not sanction the Bayern boss.\n\nHowever, Krug hinted the Spanish coach has been put under closer surveillance.\n\nSpeaking to Sport Bild, Herbert Fandel, the chairman of the referee committee of the German FA (DFB), warned Guardiola that patience is running out.\n\n\"With all due understanding for emotions in football, limits have been overstepped,\" he said.\n\n\"A coach, who storms out of his technical area and runs to the assistant at the corner flag has to be sent to the stands by the referee\n\n\"That he only received a warning against Schalke should remain an individual case.\"\n\nFandel also said that he does not like Guardiola's way of touching the referees or the fourth official, and said that this lacked the \"respect and distance\" towards the official.\n\nHe added: \"Guardiola would be wise to immediately change this behaviour.\"", "Has the \"Shaka curse\", most notably seen previously in ill-fated predictions, turned its attention to Mr. Hislop's Top 10? After Bayern Munich lost first place a week ago, now it's Real Madrid's turn to be toppled!\n\n1. Barcelona (+1)\n\n\"How David Moyes transformed Barcelona's season\" is an unlikely headline but is somewhat apt given that, since Real Sociedad's 1-0 win on Jan. 4, Luis Enrique has gone from a manager on the brink to one of renewed security, thanks to 10 straight wins, in which his team have scored 37 goals. What a turnaround!\n\n2. Atletico Madrid (+1)\n\nJust when you thought there were no more superlatives, Diego Simeone's side ran out 4-0 winners in the Madrid derby. For those keeping score, that's six straight games in which Atleti are unbeaten vs. Real Madrid since the Champions League final. They probably won't retain La Liga but we've been taught to never write them off.\n\n3. Real Madrid (-2)\n\nTalk about a bad day at the office. Carlo Ancelotti's men were bested in every department at the Calderon and seem to have developed a real problem against their city rivals. Not helping their PR either was the timing of Cristiano Ronaldo's birthday party...\n\n4. Bayern Munich (no change)\n\nNormal service has been resumed at the Allianz Arena. After back-to-back winless games to begin the second half of the Bundesliga season, Bayern picked up three points at Stuttgart. Coming up after the visit of Hamburg this weekend, they face a Champions League trip to Ukraine.\n\n5. Juventus (no change)\n\nWith four wins in their last five league games, Juventus have reminded any doubters that they are head and shoulders above the rest of Serie A. Two more winnable games are ahead vs. Cesena and Atalanta before what must be the main priority for The Old Lady: a Champions League tie vs. Borussia Dortmund.\n\n6. Chelsea (no change)\n\nThe last week has seen Chelsea claim two wins that characterise title-winning teams. First, without Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, they edged past Aston Villa before Willian's late winner ended a night of frustration vs. Everton on a happy note. It's hard to see Jose Mourinho's men being caught.\n\n7. Wolfsburg (+1)\n\nSince losing at Schalke on Nov. 22, Wolfsburg have won five and drawn three on their rise to second in the Bundesliga. Most recently, Hoffenheim were dispatched 3-0 as new signing Andre Schurrle marked his debut with an assist and two-goal Kevin De Bruyne continued to cement his status as one of Europe's most in-form players.\n\n8. Paris Saint-Germain (-1)\n\nThe quadruple chase continues in the French capital. Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned PSG a point at Ligue 1-leading Lyon before a straightforward 2-0 victory over Nantes assured French Cup progress. Caen visit the Parc des Princes on Saturday, followed by Chelsea in the first leg of the Champions League last 16.\n\n9. Lyon (no change)\n\nGiven they faced Monaco and PSG without top scorer Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon are probably content to have picked up two draws, which means they remain top, albeit by just two points. It could have been better, especially when they took the lead vs. PSG but they have come through two huge tests and remain title contenders.\n\n10. PSV Eindhoven (no change)\n\nIt's a 12-point lead in the Eredivisie now for PSV after they beat Utrecht and, barring disaster, they'll win the Dutch title for the first time since 2008. But can they stay in my Top 10? There's a few Premier League clubs pushing them and they might need a deep Europa League run to maintain their position.", "Isinbayeva dreams of new pole vault world record in Rio Published: 12 Feb 2015 at 21.45 | Viewed: 198 | Comments: 0 Online news: Sports Writer: AFP - +\n\nMOSCOW - Russian pole vault star Yelena Isinbayeva said Thursday she has been dreaming about setting a new world record at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nYelena Isinbayeva won pole vault gold medals at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and at the 2008 Beijing Games\n\n\"I want it so much (to beat the world record at Rio),\" the 32-year-old two-time Olympic champion told a news conference.\n\n\"The Olympics is a very special event for me.

How swiftly perceptions can change.\n\nLooking slimmer, and brimming with confidence since being employed in a back three, Can's purchase now looks a triumph for Liverpool and possible embarrassment for Bayern Munich, who bizarrely let him go from their youth ranks when he moved to Bayer Leverkusen with an unstable buy back clause.\n\nThe 21-year-old is not quite the standard of Gerrard at the same age so plenty of perspective is still required, but the superlatives are justly flowing on a weekly basis. Such is his current influence, one wonders if Can is indeed a potential successor to the captain, not just in terms of his dynamic influence but also when Brendan Rodgers is assessing the credentials of those to take the armband.\n\nLogic, convention and all those conservative values the majority of football managers cling onto would suggest it is too soon for Can to be a serious option for the Anfield captaincy. He has only established himself in the first team in the last three months and the form of young players is notoriously erratic, exceptional starts quite often followed by the inevitable dip.\n\nIn ideal circumstances, you would not turn to a player of such a tender age, nor wish to burden him with the extra pressure as he adapts to a new club and country. Gerrard himself was 23 when he took over from Sami Hyypia, exceptionally young, but the timing was right after a couple of years establishing himself in the first team.\n\nThe problem for Rodgers when Gerrard departs for America is he is not exactly flush with options. Jordan Henderson is seen as the most likely to be promoted given he is currently the vice-captain, but it is telling Rodgers has not confirmed a natural line of succession.\n\nCan is unlikely to be at top of his thoughts for such a role at the moment, but there must have been moments during the victory over Spurs on Tuesday night he saw the future and pondered.\n\nFrom the moment he walked into Anfield, Rodgers has consistently demonstrated age is no barrier to rapid progression.\n\nRaheem Sterling was a surprise inclusion on Rodgers' first home game against Manchester City and it hasbeen a similar theme ever since - Jordon Ibe the latest promotion to reap dividends.\n\nGiven his history, one wonders if Rodgers will spend the next six months privately contemplating whether to make another outstanding youngster the leader of his side next season.\n\nHenderson may indeed become that figure, but it is a role he is growing into rather than one that has come naturally to him.\n\nWhat was striking in the closing stages of Liverpool's victory over Spurs is it was Can above all others who was the driving force once Gerrard left early due to a hamstring tweak. His maturity defied his years.\n\nThe German has been dictating Liverpool's passing style from his defensive position for weeks, but when he moved into midfield - just as at Bolton a week ago - he imposed his class on what had been a problem area for much of the evening.\n\nIt screamed out captaincy material. In usual circumstances you would be talking about a few years from now, but how many candidates are there?\n\nOf the more senior players, Martin Skrtel has the potential to take on the role, although in the past he has been considered one of the quieter members of the dressing room.\n\nHad Lucas Leiva's future not been so uncertain he probably would have been named vice-captain last summer, with a view to taking over once Gerrard left. The problem there, despite his recent return to the starting line-up, is the Brazilian is sure to be considering his options again at the end of the season. That effectively rules him out.\n\nSteven Gerrard is leaving Liverpool at the end of the season (Rex)\n\nAdam Lallana was the skipper at Southampton, but he has not started enough games in his debut year at Anfield to be a realistic candidate. Rodgers would end up moving the armband from one player to the next from week to week.\n\nSo the smart money will remain on Henderson. In the short-term at least - unless Liverpool sign a ready made, commanding senior player in the summer - Henderson will probably get the opportunity and few will begrudge him.\n\nBut Rodgers has shown he won't shy away from bold decisions when considering the long-term consequences and Can certainly offers a radical alternative, even if the wisest juges will argue such a promotion would be more advisable in a few years rather than months.\n\nWhether it is a feasible for him to become one of Liverpool's youngest captains or not, the prophecy within Anfield that Can will eventually fill the Gerrard void no longer sounds as whimsical as it did last summer.\n\nDid you know Telegraph Sport has a Liverpool Facebook page?", "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Four goals in three matches is a sub-par performance by Bayern Munich standards.

Porto cheated Celtic out of a UEFA Cup final in Seville with an unprecedented amount of feigning injury and other time-wasting tactics in the final 10 minutes. I couldn't believe Mourinho got away with it then, and I still can't believe he gets away with it now.\n\nHe is exceptionally good at his core job, winning football matches. Possibly the best we've ever seen. Sir Alex Ferguson was a club builder par excellence but to get 11 players to win over 90 minutes, you wouldn't look past Mourinho. He led Inter Milan to the Champions League beating Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich for goodness sake.\n\nBut whereas Fergie was good for football, bringing through young players, producing largely attacking teams, Mourinho is good for his club but not for the game in general.\n\nHis constant belittling of officials, opponents (his arrogant pre-final whistle handshakes) and crass manipulation of authority and the media does our national game little good. Why Luis Figo would want Mourinho's endorsement when he is going for a serious job at FIFA is beyond me.\n\nAnd the irony is Mourinho would still be a winner if he didn't engage in any posturing, because he knows how to handle players and get the best out of them. The rest of his shtick is egotistical rubbish.\n\nPETE JENSON\n\nThere was lingering evidence of Mourinho's legacy in Spain this week when 'Mourinho was right' stickers started appearing on the lampposts around Real Madrid's training ground.\n\nIt was a reference to the players losing the Madrid derby 4-0 and then going to Cristiano Ronaldo's birthday party the same night.\n\n'It wouldn't have happened on Jose's watch,' was the message. Cue a lunchtime news debate about whether he is missed. The majority said no but to even ask the question when his successor won the Champions League is a measure of the mark he made.\n\nI translated Diego Torres' book The Special One about his time in Spain. Mourinho says it's pure fiction - a fairy story. But Torres is a respected, well-connected journalist who was writing about the fall-out with senior players at Madrid before it came to light.\n\nThat is part of the magic of Mourinho. Did he really have the team hotel swept for bugs when he believed his team news was being leaked? Did he really climb inside a laundry basket to get around a UEFA ban?\n\nThe man is pure entertainment, both when he is talking and when he's pulling that 'I'm not talking to you lot' face. He is the closest thing we have to Brian Clough and a welcome diversion from the mundane and predictable.\n\nMost importantly he can back it all up with brilliance. If he was a mid-table manager throwing tantrums and taking on TV pundits then it would soon lose its appeal but he's one the most successful managers of the modern era. He's also a showman. Long may the show go on.\n\nRIATH AL-SAMARRAI\n\nYes. Definitely. It sometimes feels like people want sport to be a perfectly clinical environment - no mistakes in the officiating, no disputes, players who live sterile lives, characters who hold supreme control of their emotions.\n\nIt sounds awfully dull. Narratives are infinitely more interesting when you have villains and Mourinho occasionally fills that role. When he does he is compelling, a source of great drama and storylines all on his own.\n\nMATT BARLOW\n\nMourinho produces strong, aggressive, well-balanced and usually successful teams. Part of that success is the intense spirit he generates. 'You fight for me and I'll fight for you,' is the mood.\n\nI don't think it's an accident. If you're not in, you're out. Within each season there's a period he identifies as vital when he turns up the pressure, demands more from his team and behaves like this to show his players he's in it with them.\n\nLast season it was closer to the end of the campaign but this year I think he believes if he drives through this month he can move clear in the title race and prioritise Europe. Without question there are times when he strays too far, says too much and the mob mentality gets ugly. But basically it's business.\n\nNot very different to the way Fergie would try to intimidate and influence. If he were in charge of my team, I would appreciate it. From a media perspective, he's dynamite and when the cameras go off there's a little more charm and humour on display. Again like Fergie. Behind the scenes, he is popular with players and staff. And, yes, I'll admit it, I'm quite fond of him.\n\nDOMINIC KING\n\nI like him. I understand why he isn't universally popular and some of his antics might not be clever but there is no doubt he is good for the Premier League.\n\nWe scrutinised Serie A and La Liga when he was with Inter Milan and Real Madrid because he is fascinating and a winner.\n\nOthers around the world will be watching the Premier League because of him. If he wasn't managing here, we would want him to come back.\n\nIn some ways he has something of Luis Suarez and Diego Costa about him: opposition fans don't like him but if he is on your side you back him to the hilt. He is absolutely good for the Premier League.\n\nCHARLES SALE\n\nNo one doubts that Mourinho is a brilliant manager, but the way he flouts Premier League media regulations has to be addressed.\n\nWith so many billions of pounds flooding into the top flight, there is a duty on Mourinho and the other managers to adhere to all their press conference commitments.\n\nBut Mourinho, like Sir Alex Ferguson before him, only turns up when it suits him and not if he feels aggrieved by media or FA treatment of Chelsea.\n\nIt took seven years for the Premier League to bring Sir Alex into line, hopefully they will deal with Mourinho rather quicker.\n\nNICK HARRIS\n\nMourinho is objectively the best active manager in the world, when best is measured by the array of major trophies in his career, and that's without considering the diversity of the clubs at which he's worked.\n\nOnly Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and perhaps Louis van Gaal come close with the younger pretenders Diego Simeone and Jurgen Klopp some way off Mourinho's long-term sustained achievements.\n\nDo we want the world's best manager in the Premier League? That's a no-brainer - yes. It's a bit like asking whether you want your country's best club competition filled with people who want to win, players and managers of uncompromising standards.\n\nOf course he's arrogant, can be tetchy, has a b*****d streak in him. He's also fiercely loyal and extremely charming; and in an irony for those who queue up to say how boorish and childishly attention-seeking he can be, they spend one hell of a lot of time and space giving him that attention.\n\nWhen he announced himself with that touchline jig at Old Trafford as Porto stunned United in 2004 you knew it.\n\nWhen he described himself as the Special One on arrival you knew it and when he came back and started winding up Arsene Wenger (again) you knew it.\n\nYou may not like his style, his arrogance or his pre-90 minute handshakes with opposing managers but you cannot take your eyes off Jose Mourinho.\n\nThe man is an entertainer in an entertainment industry, the bad guy in a tale of heroes and villains. He is great for journalists, great for television and, without a shadow of a doubt, great for the Premier League.\n\nCRAIG HOPE\n\nI'm bored of him and his victimisation tactics to the point where I won't read anything about it. Whatever happened to the 'Happy One'?\n\nHe's a brilliant manager, the best, but he's making the Premier League less and less about the football on the pitch. People call him 'Box Office'... but I feel we're now watching repeats.\n\nSAMI MOKBEL\n\nHe's the Special One for a reason. It's not just his managerial expertise, it's the entire package. The over-the-top celebrations, the tirades at rival managers, throwing strops when things aren't going his way. He wears his heart on his sleeve; when he's in a good mood, you know about it.\n\nWhen he's in a bad mood, you know about. Those in football are so guarded with their emotions nowadays. But not Mourinho - and we should embrace that.\n\nSome people love him, others can't stand the sight of him. But whether he is good for the Premier League isn't a question we should even be asking. Of course, he is.", "Manchester United are claimed in the Metro as lining up a move for Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus, despite the winger having signed a new contract this week.\n\nThe German signed a new four-and-a-half year deal this week, which was thought to have ended all speculation in his signature for this summer, but that doesn't seem to be.\n\nThe Red Devils are said to be lining up a \u00a350 Million bid for the Dortmund forward, with Louis Van Gaal 'desperate' to sign him despite his obvious rise in price, with the \u00a318 Million clause having been excluded from his new deal.\n\nManchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich were all believed to have been lining up moves for the 25 year-old this summer, but may be put off by his new asking price.\n\nDortmund currently sit third from bottom in the Bundesliga, and will more than likely struggle to keep the bulk of their key players should they fail to climb to safety.", "Jurgen Klopp said Marco Reus received a round of applause from the Borussia Dortmund players after extending his contract and said it shows his belief in the club as they look bounce back from their poor start to the season.\n\nReus signed a new contract until 2019 on Tuesday, with no release clause, despite his previous deal containing an option to leave for 25 million euros and interest from some of the world's biggest clubs.\n\nDortmund are currently in the relegation playoff position in the Bundesliga after a dismal start to the season, but Reus told BVB Total the extension represented a \"deal for life\" and Klopp feels the Germany international's decision \"sends out a strong signal.\"\n\n\"I am delighted that he made a timely decision,\" he told a news conference ahead of Friday's game against Mainz. \"In our current situation, that's good, and important for everyone involved.\"\n\nKlopp had found himself under serious pressure after Dortmund dropped to the foot of the table after taking only one point from their first two games after the winter break, but Saturday's 3-0 win over Freiburg and the news of Reus' decision have restored optimism.\n\nHe said the contract extension shows \"that Marco, just like me, is convinced that we can take care of our current difficulties, and I hope that you can tell on Friday evening [against Mainz] that everyone believes in a successful future.\"\n\nKlopp said he hopes Reus, who opened the scoring at Freiburg, can build on that performance against Mainz.\n\n\"He seemed to be very relaxed, and in great spirits, and free,\" he said. \"He received a round of applause in the dressing room.

He was brave as a lion.\"\n\nBut that match was nothing compared to what Bert had experienced before he became a footballer.\n\nIn the Second World War, the German paratrooper fought on the Western Front and the Eastern Front, before being captured by the British and made a Prisoner of War. He won five medals including the Iron Cross.\n\nAt the end of the war he declined the offer of returning to Germany and went on to have four sons, the youngest of whom died in a car crash when he was a little boy.\n\nIn 2004, Bert was awarded an OBE for promoting Anglo-German relations.\n\nBOBBY MOORE\n\nEngland and West Ham captain\n\n1958-1978\n\nAfter Winston Churchill, many regard Bobby Moore as the greatest ever Englishman.\n\nHe captained West Ham United for more than 10 years and was captain of the England team that won the 1966 World Cup, earning him an OBE for his services to football.\n\nHe is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, and was named as a member of the World Team of the 20 Century.\n\nHe won a total of 108 caps for the England team, which at the time of his international retirement in 1973 was a national record.\n\nHe remained inspirational after his retirement from football when, in February 1993, he announced he was suffering from bowel and liver cancer.\n\nThree days later, he made his last public appearance, commentating on an England match against San Marino at Wembley. Seven days after that, on 24 February, he died at the age of just 51.\n\nBut as in life, Bobby remains an inspiration in death.\n\nSoon after her husband died, his wife, Stephanie, established the Bobby Moore Fund, in partnership with Cancer Research UK in 1993.\n\nTo date the Fund has raised over \u00a321 million, which has gone towards pioneering bowel cancer research carried out by leading scientists working across the UK.\n\nMIA HAMM\n\nUnited States striker\n\n1987 - 2004\n\nMia Hamm is simply the most famous women's footballer in the world - a veritable suffragette for the popularity of the sport for young women.\n\nShe is one of the most successful and decorated women footballers, an ambassador and also an icon for the women's game in the world.\n\nJust look at her achievements:\n\nHer 275 international caps for the United States are the third highest of all time (including the men's game).\n\nShe scored 158 international goals - the second highest of all time,\n\nShe won the FIFA Women's Player of the Year in 2001 and 2002 - the first two years of its existence.\n\nShe also finished second in both 2003 and 2004 before her retirement.\n\nShe is one of just two female players to be named to the FIFA 100, commemorating the 125 greatest living soccer players.

For \u00a35.136billion, the astronomical numbers from the latest TV deal, it would be easy to say that about the Barclays Premier League.\n\nBut is it really 'the best'? At this moment, I have to say no. We absolutely have the best football product in the business and that's why the fight between TV companies to secure the rights was ferocious.\n\nOn the day the deal was announced, Liverpool and Tottenham conjured up a thrilling contest, advertising all that is good about the Premier League, but, in terms of pure quality, I don't think we can make the boast of being the best.\n\nWith the money that has flooded in, our teams should be carrying all before them in Europe. In the not-too-distant future, some clubs will be in a position where they will not only be able to get into bidding wars with Real Madrid and Barcelona but actually trump them.\n\nAt the minute, however, we don't have the strength and depth of other leagues on the continent and the resumption of both European competitions next week brings that sharply into focus. With the financial power English clubs have, we should be favourites to do a clean sweep.\n\nThe Europa League, in particular, is something we should be stamping our presence all over. That tournament gets criticised but I believe it is the real indicator of how strong a country's league is. England's performance in the last 15 years has, frankly, been awful.\n\nOnly Liverpool (2001) and Chelsea (2013) have lifted the trophy; Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) are the others who have contested the final. Spanish teams, in the same period, have provided six winners and three other finalists. We have grossly underperformed.\n\nIt is the same in the Champions League. With Borussia Dortmund in the bottom three of the Bundesliga, Germany only has one team (Bayern Munich) capable of winning it. With the threat from Italy and France also minimal, the path should be clear but, of our three remaining candidates, only Chelsea look capable of going all the way.\n\nSo it throws up the question of how clubs are investing their riches. And that is one of my big concerns: recruitment. Have these incredible figures put agents and players around the globe on alert that England is the place to come and make a killing?\n\nThis is not just a deal for English football. Some will see it as a deal for world football but will our clubs now get kidded when they go looking for players? Only Chelsea have recruited well recently. Can Liverpool, Tottenham or Manchester United say the same?\n\nIs it too easy for these clubs to say 'we've got the money' rather than scouting properly?\n\nDo not confuse this for me saying clubs should only be buying British: I want to see clubs continue to buy stars such as Diego Costa, Alexis Sanchez and Angel di Maria; performers like Marco Reus and Paul Pogba would be welcome additions in the future and we want the best managers here, too.\n\nMy worry is we will see an influx of dross arriving, players who know they will get lavishly rewarded for not doing much but will block the development of young local talent. They are the most worrying transfers. Clubs cannot fall into a trap of thinking success will come just by throwing money around.\n\nI spoke to a respected figure who works in development football and he conducted a study of the top Premier League clubs' use of players within their 25-man squads; essentially, there tends to be 14 or 15 players within each group -- the mainstays -- who play 75 per cent of all matches. We want the best players coming in to challenge them, the concern is the players who occupy the other eight to 10 places. We don't want players to come in and snuff out the chances of local kids at the club, just because they have cost money. They add nothing and stop progress.\n\nWatching Jordon Ibe and Harry Kane in midweek put that into focus. Both players have had spells out on loan and such moves are becoming increasingly crucial in a young player's education as they are competing against men for points and fighting to show they are good enough. With that experience, they should be given the chance to support the regulars. Only rarely do we get young English stars such as Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney or Raheem Sterling, who go straight into the team as a teenager. Clubs have a duty to give those who have put 10 years or more in at an academy a proper opportunity to succeed.\n\nOne aspect that should be looked at accordingly is the 'homegrown' rule. It is a nonsense that players such as Wojciech Szczesny and Cesc Fabregas, for instance, can be classed as being locally produced even though they were recruited from abroad.\n\nThe added spin-off of that will help benefit the England team in the long term. I've heard it said that the Premier League has hindered England's performances in the last two decades but let's not kid ourselves on that -- England were struggling at tournaments long before 1992.\n\nWhat we should not lose sight of, either, is how supporters should be treated and surely now is the time for clubs to give something back to those who have stood by them through thick and thin?\n\nCan clubs find a way of providing subsidies for away travel and agree that \u00a320 for an away ticket is the top limit? Why can't the 20 chairmen make that the fair price? For the money they are going to earn, any fall in gate receipts would be minimal.\n\nThey are all issues that, in time, will be addressed. The Premier League is the best concept in football, one that we should be proud of. But is it the best in all areas? No. Not yet.\n\nRODGERS MUST FACE DOWN BOGEYMEN\n\nSome games from childhood last a lifetime and the 1990 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Crystal Palace is one that has stayed with me.\n\nI remember coming in from playing Sunday League football and being completely stunned that Liverpool could lose 4-3 to opponents like Palace. It was a defeat that stripped Liverpool's aura of invincibility and, I felt, started the club's demise.\n\nThere is no doubt Palace have been a bogey team for Liverpool. They shattered Brendan Rodgers's hopes of bringing the title back to Anfield and the effects of that 3-3 draw were still being felt all the way through to last November, when Liverpool folded at Selhurst Park and were beaten 3-1.\n\nOnly after that defeat were Liverpool able to start recovering and while they head into Saturday night's FA Cup fifth-round tie with an opportunity to really build some momentum, the squad will be conscious of the threat Alan Pardew's men pose.\n\nIt is the tie of the weekend, as Palace will be aiming to inflict further misery on Liverpool and dreaming of the chance to repeat their achievements of 1990 and get back to Wembley. They can be difficult opposition when the home crowd get behind them. This match, however, is huge for Liverpool.\n\nWith their hopes of getting into the top four still delicately balanced and a tough Europa League fixture against Besiktas looming, they cannot afford to let the FA Cup slip away.\n\nThey cannot suffer at the hands of their bogeymen again.\n\nTHIS WEEK I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO... LOUIS VAN GAAL'S NEXT PRESS CONFERENCE\n\nManchester United's manager came in for criticism this week for how he handled some barbs from Sam Allardyce after the sides drew 1-1 at Upton Park.\n\nAs soon as Van Gaal started handing out sheets at his conference before the game with Burnley you could hear people say 'he's lost it', because it's not something you see a manager do every day. But I applauded him for standing up for his beliefs.\n\nIt was also hilarious when he was passing around the sheets with his tactics on and came out with the line: 'Give this to Big Sam!'.\n\nHow many of these press conferences do we see that are filled with endless cliches and quotes you have heard 100 times before?

But the U.S. Men's National Team coach is happy where he is already, according to a new ESPNFC report.\n\nKlinsmann's name had been making the rounds, along with former Tottenham coach Tim Sherwood, as candidates to head the beleaguered English Premier League club, but Klinsmann isn't interested.\n\nAccording to unnamed sources, Klinsmann, who previously lived in England while playing for Spurs, is settled with his life in the U.S. and is looking forward to building for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nThe ESPNFC report also suggests that Klinsmann may be wary of taking over a side that has been struggling so late in the season, especially if an ownership change is a possibility for the club. Villa owner Randy Lerner put the club up for sale last year.\n\nVilla has been having a rough go of it as of late. Over the weekend, they Villa lost 2-0 to Hull City, moving Hull out of the relegation zone and dropping Villa to the bottom three of the Premier League table.\n\nBy Wednesday, the club announced it has \"parted company\" with Lambert, adding that they would \"announce a new manager in due course.\" The club said first-team coach Scott Marshall and goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall would continue to manage the team in the interim.\n\nKlinsmann, a former coach for Bayern Munich, joined the USMNT as coach in 2011.", "The Bayern Munich midfielder selected his Champions League all-time XI, selecting former team mates and players he's played against.\n\nThe Champions League has always been a special tournament for Xabi Alonso. The midfielder has starred in the competition with four different sides during his career: Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich; and scored in the memorable 2005 final in Istanbul.\n\nThe two-time European champion selected his all-time line-up of Champions League greats, including several players who have now retired.\n\nXabi's Champions League team:\n\nManuel Neuer. I have played with some fantastic goalkeepers, but he is the best. It isn't just the ability he has to make saves, but how good he is outfield and the fantastic composure that he always shows on the ball.\n\nPhilipp Lahm. He's such a great player for Bayern; his leadership and qualities have been missed while he has been injured. Hopefully we will have him back for some important matches before the end of the season. He is comfortably one of the top five defenders of the last 10 years.\n\nCarles Puyol. So important for Spain's success at the Euros in 2008 and then was even better when we won the World Cup in 2010. So dependable at the back, and then scored that winning goal against Germany in the semi-final.\n\nSergio Ramos. When Sergio is mentally on the top of his game, then I think he is the best there is. He is a leader, he gives everything, and as a player in midfield he is the sort of defender that makes you feel very comfortable being behind you.\n\nDavid Alaba. One of those players who I think does not get the recognition outside of Germany and Austria he deserves. Maybe the most complete full back in the world who can attack and defend brilliantly. When I joined Bayern it was him and Neuer who impressed me the most.\n\nXavi Hern\u00e1ndez. Such an intelligent player - and proof that you don't have to cover 100 miles to be effective. So much of Spain's success was because we played with so many midfield players, and Xavi was at the centre of everything.\n\nPaul Scholes. In Spain you would not believe how well respected he is by professionals and journalists. Maybe because he was quiet off the field he never got the right praise in England because he likes to keep a low profile. Technically he could have played in any league in the world.\n\nSteven Gerrard. He is a great friend and has been a big influence on my life.

I played against him when he was at Madrid and also against France, then of course he was part of the staff when I was playing for Real. At his peak he was on a different level to anybody, made the most difficult of things look easy.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo. If you looked at his goal scoring record for Real Madrid and you hadn't witnessed it yourself, then you just wouldn't believe that it is possible. I have been privileged to play with some amazing players, but he is the best.\n\nLeo Messi. To have two players like Messi and Ronaldo in the same era is pretty rare. The individual brilliance that they are capable of sets them apart. It is no surprise that they have won so many Ballon d'Or awards between them.", "This week's roundup of the biggest news stories in football sees a 30th birthday party cause a week-long hangover, a Manchester United manager invoke the spirit of an ex-Liverpool boss and the biggest story of the summer transfer window scuppered already.\n\n1. Ronaldo's birthday blues (Monday, Feb. 9)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has not had a good start to 2015, despite winning a second straight Ballon d'Or in early January. He has split from his long-term partner, seen Barcelona cut Real Madrid's lead at the top of La Liga cut to just one point due in no small part to Lionel Messi's resurgent scoring form and returned from suspension in time to be on the wrong end of a 4-0 humbling in the Madrid derby.\n\nBut it was Ronaldo's 30th birthday, of all things, which is behind his most recent cause for woe. Following the heavy defeat at Atletico, Ronaldo went ahead with his celebrations as planned, but received plenty of criticism from Real fans who didn't take kindly to video footage of him partying the night away and singing with reggaeton star Kevin Roldan just hours after the loss.\n\nSam Allardyce is a manager who quite openly revels in taking points off the big-name managers, but even he cannot have predicted Louis van Gaal's reaction to his remarks about the Dutchman's so-called long-ball tactics following Sunday's 1-1 draw between West Ham and Manchester United.\n\nVan Gaal responded by producing a four-page dossier of diagrams and statistics at his next news conference in order to refute that claim, but any hopes that would be the final word on the matter were quickly dispelled.\n\nAs he passed the dossier around, saying \"you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation,\" Van Gaal was literally giving the assembled media the ideal material to help express their doubts over the Dutchman's tenure. After the predictable comparisons to Rafa Benitez's now infamous \"facts\" speech, the focus is now back on Van Gaal -- to the point that even Wednesday's 3-1 win over Burnley drew more criticism than praise.\n\nThe upcoming summer transfer window is going to need a new main protagonist now that Marco Reus has committed his future to Borussia Dortmund. Rumblings that a deal could be signed emerged in Germany on Monday, but when the signing of a contract extension that runs until 2020 was announced the following day it still took the football world by surprise.\n\nThe reaction across the country was one of delight, with the media hailing the forward for his integrity, his teammates applauding him in the dressing room and even Bayern Munich claiming that a strong Dortmund would benefit them too.\n\nThat a club managing to keep hold of a player they already own is regarded as a \"coup\" is a strong indication of the relative power of Europe's top clubs, but with Dortmund still languishing in the lower reaches of the Bundesliga, this is not the time to look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nIn September 2014, after they had won three of their first four Premier League fixtures of the season, Aston Villa handed Paul Lambert a contract extension until 2018. Since then the club have won just two more league matches and scored nine goals in the competition.\n\nSo it was no surprise to see Lambert finally sacked on Wednesday following their 2-0 defeat at fellow strugglers Hull City that moved the Tigers out of the bottom three at Villa's expense.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann, Steve McClaren and Avram Grant have already ruled themselves out of the running for the vacancy while Tim Sherwood, the perennial front-runner for every job going these days, is yet to show his hand. Whoever eventually takes the reins for the rest of the season, they will need to get Villa scoring and quickly to have any chance of saving the former European champions from a first relegation in almost 30 years.\n\nJose Mourinho is going through one of his occasional rows with authority at the moment.

Almeria are coming off an away win at fellow relegation battlers Cordoba. As has been the case this year, Almeria were stronger on the road with two goals in quick succession, both scored by right back Michel Macedo and both assisted by his fellow Brazilian and Arsenal loanee, Wellington. Almeria have now claimed 16 points and 13 goals on the road, while collecting a mere six points in 10 home games with a negative eight goal differential. They've now won two straight matches against bottom of the table competition and look to continue the streak against Real Sociedad. La Real's position belies their ability, as they sport an average team rating and goal differential that is more fitting for a top half side. They recently drew at home against suddenly feisty Celta Vigo. RSD have been as awful on the road as Almeria has at home, so something will have to give, as the saying goes.\n\nSevilla enter the game after two straight losses, most recently to relegation candidates Getafe. Sevilla's season form has seen mostly positive results when not playing the top three teams. Recently, however, they have lost 4 of their last 6 matches, with wins by Valencia and Villareal eroding their hold on fourth place in La Liga (Valencia has now passed them with Villareal sitting one point out). Fortunately, they have been very hard to defeat at home. With some of his choices being second-guessed, it's hard to say what Unai Emery's lineup will be, but Barca loanee Gerard Deulofeu is expected to be back in the lineup, and he could trouble Cordoba on the wings. Cordoba have fought hard over the last month, winning both at home and away to Granada and Rayo Vallecano, showing determination and defensive solidarity even in losing efforts (they played tight games against Eibar, Celta Vigo, and even stayed within a goal of Real Madrid). Cordoba's level of play is not fitting of the bottom three, at least defensively; though they have been unable to produce many goals (17 total this year, second to last in La Liga). They are still dealing with injury concerns, limiting their lineup. Fede Cartabia is having an impressive season and will be leaned on, while Man City loanee Bruno Zuculini is expected to get his first start, A hungry Sevilla at home should be too much, however.\n\nDeportivo La Coruna @ Real Madrid\n\nReal Madrid's portion of this section will be easy writing, as most cules on this site are well aware of their recent struggles. Questions of the team's heart, Ancelotti's rotations, or \"peaking too soon\" may actually be cause for concern at some point, but the real problem against Atletico was three injuries and a suspension, leaving them without the creative talents of James and Marcelo, but also the experience and leadership of Ramos and Pepe. Creative lynchpin Marcelo will be back after a suspension and his playmaking ability on the wing will be welcomed after a stagnant match against Atletico Madrid in which the squad could only muster one shot on goal. The loss of Sergio Ramos and Pepe showed itself against Atletico, as the lack of experience and playing time in the back line could be directly attributed to at least one of the goals conceded. Statistics for this year still show Madrid as one of the best sides in the world, though in the last month they have looked unspectacular in wins against bottom-dwelling teams (Barcelona have now surpassed them in terms of goal differential and sit one point off the league lead), were sluggish in handling Sevilla at home, and then were eviscerated by a dominant-looking Atletico. The La Coruna squad, sitting a whopping 30 points off the leaders, looks to be the perfect remedy for what ails Madrid. They are mediocre across the board, not showing any preference for playing any better or worse at home or away. Distressingly, though, Coruna have the least amount of away goals this year. Injury concerns have left their backline wanting, as well. However, they have played better as the year has progressed. Even with injuries and what looks to be a lack of urgency as of late, Madrid should have way too much talent for Coruna to challenge them. Ancelloti should also fix some of the tactical errors he made against Atletico. However, Madrid need to get back to the inspired play soon, or else not only will Barcelona and Atletico apply pressure, but the second tier teams of La Liga (Valencia, Sevilla, Villareal) will be able to steal points as well.\n\nAthletic Bilbao @ Granada\n\nAs most here will know, Athletic played bravely against Barca, pressing the visiting side high while avoiding park the bus tactics, and took a 5-2 beating for their efforts. Granada, who would never be mistaken for an in-form Barca, lost against Villareal 2-0 at one of the toughest away venues, El Madrigal. Granada sits in the relegation zone, one point below Levante, who are currently 17. Bilbao, seemingly more comfortable at 13 place, actually only sit 5 points ahead of Granada. Both teams will be on the favorable side of their home/road splits, as Granada has been slightly better at home and Bilbao has performed well on the road. Otherwise, these teams are not far apart. This match looks like a toss-up for those reasons, and given the fact that the bottom half of the table is almost the same quality-wise from 11 to 20th place, it's difficult to predict outcomes between such teams.\n\nEspanyol @ Malaga\n\nMalaga are coming off a surprise thrashing by bottom dwelling Levante. The home side had scored a mere 13 goals in 21 games before going off for four on a sloppy Malaga side. Individual errors and careless fouls led to two penalties and the attack never got going. The Andalusians currently sit in a peculiar position in the table. They are six points off Villareal and don't look to threaten for Europa League qualification, yet are nine points ahead of Eibar and are clearly above the very crowded relegation battle. Funny enough, their goal differential of ZERO encapsulates their position at the moment: not bad, but not good. The other Barcelona club is coming off an understandable home loss to Valencia. Espanyol are only two spots lower on the table, but are nine points off Malaga. Unfortunately for Espanyol, 21 of their total 26 points have been earned at home, and they are 1-2-7 on the road this year, the worst mark in La Liga.\n\nValencia had a great weekend, their win at Espanyol and Sevilla's surprise loss left them in 4 place in the league, in position for a Champion's League playoff spot. Pablo Piatti returned and scored a goal, and Dani Parejo hit a free kick square off the keeper's face for an own goal, just to add insult to injury. Notably, wonderkid Jose Luis Gaya continues his scintillating play down the left sideline. The teenage left back, a product of the Mestalla academy system, has been given an opportunity after the departure of Juan Bernat to FC Bayern (Jordi Alba was on Valencia at one point, too, it's a left back factory), and he's been a revelation. He has been the prototypical wingback, using his immense acceleration and stamina to patrol the entire left side of the field, with defensive midfielder Javi Fuego dropping back to cover his runs at times. His crossing and ball skills have been phenomenal, and he has a defensive work rate to match. Against Espanyol he provided the assist to Piatti in the 61 minute and then cleared a dangerous ball off the line in the 80th, for example. He should become one of the best left backs in Europe, but before this article becomes a testament to Gaya, lets look at Getafe. They are coming off a surprise victory (much to the delight of Valencia), which helped them keep their heads above the relegation zone for another week. Unfortunately for Getafe, Valencia have collected the second most home points this year (and remain one of the toughest places to play), while they have collected a measly eight points out of a possible 30 on the road. They also looked to be a little \"lucky\" against Sevilla, as the visiting team looked off, Unai Emery's coaching lacked imagination and the side just looked generally uninspired. Valencia should handle this matchup with ease.\n\nLevante @ Barcelona\n\nBarcelona will kill them. Read the in-depth preview on this site!\n\nVillareal @ Rayo Vallecano\n\nVillareal kept up their position to qualify for Europe with a 2-0 win over now last place Granada. It was a competent if not spectacular performance, though Villareal clearly was the deserving winner. They are now 5-1-0 in their last six, beating bottom-dwellers and losing in a close match to Barcelona. Rayo had a chance to get a little above the relegation fray, but were thoroughly outplayed by 17 place Elche on the road. They are in poor form, losing their last three. Amazingly, Rayo have gained only seven of a possible 30 points at home this season. The team makes a lot of errors and has problems defending the counter-attack, so this should play right into Villareal's strengths.\n\nAtletico Madrid @ Celta Vigo\n\nAtletico Madrid is last weekend's winner, reminding everyone in Spain who last year's league champ was with a dismantling of Real Madrid. They also showed that they are capable of more than physical tackles and set piece goals in the process, with Antoine Griezman continuing to prove that he is becoming one of the best young attacking players in Europe. Atletico travel to Basque Country and bring with them an impressive 19 points out of a possible 30 on the road this year. Midfield workhorse Koke will be out for a considerable time and is a very difficult player to replace. It will be seen what Simeone decides to do with his midfield, but he does have capable backups. Celta Vigo started the year off well, but had seen some bad form over the past month before picking up the slack in their last two matches, and has more talent than their current position on the table suggests. They have been much harder to defeat at home, and will have at least that consolation when a much more talented Atletico side come to town. Although Celta Vigo have shown strength in defending set pieces, Atletico won't feel like they need one to score.", "Phillipp Lahm backs Pep Guardiola extension at Bayern Munich\n\nGermany and Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm said he thinks the current talk about coach Pep Guardiola's potential contract renewal issues is completely unfounded.\n\n\"This is absolutely no topic,\" Lahm said of the club's future during an exclusive interview with ESPN FC. \"I mean it is 1 1/2 years.

Now we are positioned very well again. All this is also a big part because of the coach.\"\n\nLahm said Bayern are flexible tactically, but that having many playing options is a good problem to have.\n\n\"As a whole I think that a coach has never an easy task, especially if you have a choice of so many world class players that have already proven in the past that they can play at an absolutely high level in every situation, in every game,\" Lahm said. \"That is already a tough decision for a coach. Who do I bring on the field? Yes, still the coach has to find a mix [keep] everybody a little bit content then to integrate injured players back 100 percent.\n\n\"As a coach, you never have an easy job but I think our coach brings this very well to the point.\"\n\nThe Bundesliga leaders are also on course to win their third championship in a row. No German team has ever been able to win four consecutive league titles, but Guardiola has 18 months left on this contract.\n\n\"One thing is certain, the season is very long,\" Lahm said. \"There is no team that plays from the first to the last day at the same constant high level is playing football. There will always be phases where one plays a bit worse.

The Gunners' first back-to-back wins are fresher in the memory, however (2002 & 2003), and were under the same manager in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But which group of players were better, the Cup-winning team of 2003 or today's crop? Who would you pick in your composite XI?\n\nDavid Seaman vs David Ospina\n\nOn the surface this could be a mismatch - Seaman has four FA Cup winners' medals in his drawer, two league titles and a European Cup-Winners Cup to his name.\n\nBut, if performing on the biggest stage is the measure of the man, Ospina, who has nudged out Wojciech Sczcesny from Arsenal's best XI, had a brilliant World Cup in Brazil, while it's best not to mention World Cups and Brazil in the same sentence to Seaman.\n\nLauren vs Hector Bellorin\n\nThis could be a question worth asking again in a few years, as Bellerin appears to have everything a modern full-back could need - he is fast, has fine distribution, and was schooled at La Masia, Barcelona's famous academy, before Arsenal enticed him away. The 19-year-old has broken into the first team this season, albeit in arguably the position most up for grabs in Wenger's first XI.\n\nFew Arsenal fans had heard of Lauren when he arrived at Highbury, but the Cameroon international would go on to become a key member of Arsenal's Invincibles, an attacking full-back when attacking Arsenal full-backs came into fashion. Two Premier League titles and three FA Cup finals are tough to dispute.\n\nMartin Keown vs Per Mertesacker\n\nTwo defenders who have made the most of their strengths and minimised their deficiencies. Keown was a snarling, in-your-face hard man that no forwards would enjoy playing against. His team-mate Ray Parlour described him as a rash, and he was not talking about his pock-marked face.\n\nMertesacker is slow, ponderous, and was described as having the \"agility of a rhinoceros\" by Wojciech Sczcesny's father this season, but he is also a key component of Germany's World Cup winning side of last year, so you do the math.\n\nOleg Luzhny vs Laurent Koscielny\n\nLuzhny was predominantly a right-back, signed to take over from Lee Dixon, which never really happened because the Ukrainian who arrived at Highbury never hit the heights he did at Dynamo Kiev. Nicknamed \"the horse\" by fans for his tendency to gallop upfield, he picked up a league winners' medal and was at least versatile enough to play in the middle.\n\nKoscielny is equally versatile and has attracted the attention, according to his agent at least, of Barcelona and Bayern Munich during his time at the Emirates. The Frenchman displaced Thomas Vermaelen at Arsenal, leading to the former captain suffering the ignominy of a transfer to Barcelona.\n\nAshley Cole vs Nacho Monreal\n\n\"Cashley\", for all his perceived faults, was a rampaging full-back who used to play centre-forward in his youth, another key member of Wenger's Invincibles. He soured relations with fans with the \u00a355,000 a week car-swerving episode, but is quality was beyond question.\n\nMonreal goes relatively under the radar in Arsenal's public consciousness, but the 28-year-old Spaniard is a more solid defender than the left-back he is keeping out of the team, Kieran Gibbs.\n\nGilberto Silva vs Francis Coquelin\n\nThere is an argument that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger have failed to fill the hole in defensive midfield left by the Brazilian World Cup winner, another Invincible. One swallow does not make a summer, but Francis Coquelin's brilliant performance in Arsenal's 2-0 win away to Manchester City in January, provoked comparisons with the great Gilberto. Time will tell.\n\nRay Parlour vs Aaron Ramsey\n\nParlour's love of a sociable evening indicated that he would not thrive under Wenger's lifestyle-conscious regime, yet the \"Romford Pele\" grew to be one of the most reliable and underrated members of his manager's early years. Tenacious and hard-working, an Arsenal man through and through.\n\nRamsey is injured - again - which is the biggest negative about a player who over the last two seasons appeared to be fulfilling massive potential as a midfielder with every string to his bow.\n\nRobert Pires vs Alexis Sanchez\n\nA heavyweight contest. Pires, at his best, was a magnificent sight down the flank for Arsenal, tall, graceful, skilled and voted by fans as their sixth-greatest player ever. A World Cup and European Championship winner with France to boot.\n\nSanchez has settled into north London, quicker than anyone could have dreamed, hitting 18 goals in 33 appearances for the club playing either out wide or through the middle. The Chilean can never expect to emulate Pires' international achievements, but the former Barcelona forward is a genuine candidate to be the Premier League's player of the year in only his first season.\n\nFredrik Ljungberg vs Mesut Ozil\n\nLjungberg, the Swedish underwear model, was a highly popular exponent of the Wenger way - athletic, versatile, and committed. Coming in off either flank or sitting behind the strikers, he also had a habit of scoring goals when they were most needed. Five major winners' medals are evidence enough of his quality.\n\nOzil, has a World Cup winners' medal, however. He also has Real Madrid on his CV and a reputation as one of the world's most creative players.

No, Hamburg aren't particularly sexy, but Der Dinosaurier are the only original member of the Bundesliga to never be relegated, though that could change this year.\n\nHSV are presently four points clear of relegation, but given their offensive struggles -- in all of Europe's top leagues, only Aston Villa have had more difficulty scoring -- they're treading turgid waters. Hamburg have scored just 14 goals in 20 games; by comparison, Bayern's Arjen Robben has 12 goals in 16 Bundesliga games. (In case that math is too daunting: a single Bayern Munich player is scoring goals at a faster rate than the club he faces on Saturday.)\n\nIn order to spark the offense, Die Rothosen added Croatian stalwart Ivica Olic in the winter transfer window, a homecoming for the 35-year-old striker who left HSV for Bayern in 2009. Another Hamburger with Munich ties: American wunderkind Julian Green, who has struggled with a rib injury and hasn't seen playing time since November (a report that Green was being demoted to Hamburg's under-23 team was untrue). FUN FACT: Olic and Green are the only two Hamburg players who scored a goal at the last World Cup; Bayern have four who combined for 11 goals (and it's worth noting that Franck Rib\u00e9ry and Robert Lewandowski didn't play in the World Cup).\n\n\"But Bayern are struggling!\" says someone making a case that this game will be close. True, the Bavarians got trounced by Wolfsburg and drew a tough Schalke team in consecutive games, representing five of the superteam's 11 dropped points -- and five of their nine goals allowed -- all season. But Bayern still have a +36 goal differential and are eight points clear on the table; they're doing just fine, even by FC Bayern's rigorous standards.\n\nSo why tune in? For ageless Arjen Robben deftly cutting left even though the defender knows that's where he's going. For Rib\u00e9ry bombing down the opposite sideline. For Philipp Lahm's perfection on the pitch. For Manuel Neuer's larger-than-life presence in goal, and his derring-do out of it. For Pep Guardiola's impeccable fashion and Handsome Dad-ness. For the clinical majesty of Robert Lewandowski. For all the usual reasons you watch a buzzsaw at work: because a clean line through solid wood is immensely satisfying to watch.

Initially plying his trade in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) with the Georgia Revolution, a strong showing in the US Open Cup against the nearby Atlanta Silverbacks afforded him the chance to play on a bigger stage.\n\nThe Silverbacks were forced to wait for their man, however. \"We didn't want to get the word out too much about him,\" the Silverbacks general manager, Andy Smith, explained. In the process of acquiring a green card, Poku's discovery late in the season proved poor timing for the team.\n\nEventually acquired ahead of the 2014 season, it was then that his true position became evident. \"With the Georgia Revolution he was playing as a forward,\" Smith explains. \"That's what we initially thought he was, but in a conversation it came up he was originally a holding midfielder and that he tries to model himself on Yaya Tour\u00e9.\"\n\nIt would also seem that is where Poku fits into the plans of Jason Kreis. Against St Mirren he confidently sprayed the ball from left to right before engaging in some driving runs in the final third, leaving both the commentators and viewers alike enthusiastic at what they had seen.\n\nThus it should come as little surprise that a quartet of MLS sides including the Chicago Fire and Real Salt Lake courted Poku during 2014, as he once again shone in the US Open Cup - netting the only goal in a win over RSL. Again besting MLS opposition in the the next round, Poku grabbed the headlines as he was harshly sent off for attempting to break up a fight late in the game against the Colorado Rapids.\n\nIt was also around this time that teams in MLS began to take notice. As Smith explains the eventual trade between New York and Seattle was the product of a \"crazy\" race to file a Discovery Claim: \"It was who got that piece of paper in first,\" he said.\n\nThe piece of paper in question is part of a league rule in which teams can claim they have discovered a player. Perhaps more interesting is Smith's revelation that Seattle took the Ghanian on trial last year, but as he bluntly explains: \"They offered us nothing for him, it was silly. They didn't see it [his talent].\"\n\nThat had further consequences. With Seattle's offer of zero dollars up front with incentives still being considered a valid bid, it locked Poku in. For New York to procure him, not only would they have to deal with Atlanta put they would also have to satisfy Seattle's demands - eventually sending a conditional draft pick in 2017 for the 22-year-old's rights.\n\nSmith is still surprised by the Sounders' decision to allow New York to sign Poku . The Silverbacks GM is a considerable fan of his former midfielder, a player he describes as \"raw\" but also \"a huge talent\".\n\nOff the pitch, it would seem he is a positive influence too: \"No one has a bad thing to say about him,\" Smith explains. \"He's incredibly respectful. A gentle giant is a great way of putting it.\"\n\nPoku is far from the finished product and could still benefit from adding goals to his game - he scored just twice last season. If he can score more often, New York may have picked up one of NASL's brightest talents in years.\n\nPoku is currently at Manchester City's extravagant training complex, and there is every chance the two men may train side by side this week as Tour\u00e9 returns from international duty at the same time as New York begin their pre-season schedule.\n\nManchester City have won just once this season in the league without the influential Tour\u00e9, a sign of the importance of the Ivorian's commanding presence in a team full of star turns. If New York City can utilise Poku to his optimum, they could reap the rewards of their own version of Tour\u00e9.", "The football is miserable at times - too few of current players are prepared to take risks\n\nPart of being a Manchester United player under Alex Ferguson, perhaps the most important part of being one of United's attacking players, was that when you were in possession you had to take risks in order to create goalscoring chances. It was not an option; it was an obligation.\n\nIn the periods of my career when I stopped passing the ball forward, or when I stopped looking for the risky pass that might open up a defence, the consequences were the same. The manager stopped picking me. I got back into the team when I went back to doing it the way he wanted.\n\nUnited's history was built on attacking football, which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances. Why do you think United have had some of the best goalkeepers in the world over the years? They needed them because the team committed so many players forward.\n\nIt does not give me any pleasure to say that at the moment I am struggling to watch Louis van Gaal's team with any great enjoyment. They beat Burnley on Wednesday night but it was Burnley who had by far the best of the first half. At times, United's football is miserable. To beat opposing teams you have to attack, and to attack you have to take risks. Too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks.\n\nAs a midfielder at United I had to pass the ball forward and, yes, it did not always work. It did not always mean putting a chance on a plate for the strikers. It was up to them to get on the ball and score goals. Was it easy? No, but we were playing for United. It was not supposed to be easy. Of the current team, Angel Di Maria has taken more risks than any other player and, unfortunately, for him it has not worked out. He has given the ball away a lot for very little return.\n\nOtherwise there seems to be an emphasis on possession. I would go further than that: there is an obsession with possession.\n\nUnited fans don't care if the team only has 40 per cent possession as long as they are watching an attacking team. My experience was that the supporters understood that even our best teams, even the teams with Peter Schmeichel or Edwin van der Sar in goal, were going to concede goals. We were not reckless, or naive, but always the chief aim was to attack - and we backed ourselves to outscore the opposition.\n\nThis season, how many times have United been rescued by David de Gea? Without him they would be three, four places lower down the table.\n\nI realise that the comparisons I am making are with a golden age in United's history and that nothing lasts for ever. I was fortunate to play with so many wonderful footballers and under the greatest manager of all time, but I do believe that a club's ethos, the principles of how it plays, should outlive even the biggest individuals in its history. United are about attacking football, and everything else has to takes its place behind that.\n\nWe come at last to the two strikers, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. I feel they look like strangers at times, while Wayne Rooney is moved around the team to accommodate them.\n\nWayne can play anywhere on the pitch. He is so willing, and he will give you at least a 7/10 performance most times. Against Burnley, he ended up as a defensive midfielder. At other times he has been pushed out to the right-hand side, where he will look for the strikers early or switch the play. But if Van Gaal does not think Rooney is a better option up front than the other two then there really is a problem.\n\nHe has a fantastic goalscoring record for United, behind only Bobby Charlton and Denis Law, yet against West Ham he did not have a single touch in the opposition's box. That cannot be good for the team.\n\nVan Gaal has taken some criticism for his Tuesday press conference when he produced those statistical printouts to come back at Sam Allardyce over his joke that United were a long-ball team. There was part of me that was pleased to see Van Gaal show a bit of edge and take someone on. It is what we expected of him when he was appointed.\n\nEven so, I know Big Sam quite well and he had his tongue firmly in cheek when he said what he did about United.\n\nAt the end of the day, all Van Gaal had to remind himself was that, for all Big Sam's qualities, we were not talking about the manager of Real Madrid or Liverpool or Bayern Munich. We were talking about West Ham. There was no need to rise to the bait. (\u00a9 Independent News Service)\n\nI realise that my inadvertent remark on BT Sport that was picked up by the cameras has caused a fair bit of amusement.\n\nI have to be clear about one thing, the \"knobhead\" comment was something of a reflex that came out because I must have been so relaxed on the Fletch and Sav sofa. In reality, I did not even realise I had said it until the presenter, Darren Fletcher, apologised on air a few minutes later.\n\nSo let me clarify: I don't think Robbie Savage is a knobhead! We have known each other since we were kids and I enjoy being on the show with him. I am sure we said much worse to each other in those Manchester United youth teams.

Nichols is being held without bail.\n\nAccording to the documents filed in this case, other cases, and statements made in court: On May 28, 2012, Nichols and three men were traveling in a gray Dodge Magnum toward Elizabeth. Nichols was driving the vehicle.\n\nUpon arriving in Elizabeth, the three men exited the car and approached a 2005 BMW 645. The men pointed handguns in the direction of the BMW's passengers and ordered them out of the car. Two of the men then entered the BMW and drove it away.\n\nThe third man re-entered the Dodge Magnum driven by Nichols. The third man was carrying a black Taurus Millennium semi-automatic handgun and a cell phone that had been stolen from one of the occupants of the BMW. Nichols and the third man drove away and followed the stolen BMW.\n\nWhile driving away from the scene, multiple police vehicles activated their overhead lights and turned on their sirens in an effort to stop Nichols. Nichols continued to drive the Dodge Magnum at a high rate of speed from Elizabeth into Newark, drove through a red light and struck a vehicle at the intersection of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Market Street.\n\nThe driver of the other vehicle suffered serious injury. Nichols and the other man then attempted to flee the area on foot.\n\nSubsequently, while detained at the Essex County Correctional Facility on the armed carjacking charge, Nichols conspired with others, including Solomon, Dwayne Harper, 31, of Newark, and Darsell Davis, 29, of Newark, to pay cash bribes to Solomon so that he would smuggle contraband - including cell phones, tobacco, and marijuana - into the Essex County Correctional Facility.\n\nAfter Davis and Harper collected the contraband, Davis delivered the items and cash bribes to Solomon, who then smuggled the contraband to Nichols. Nichols ultimately sold the marijuana and cell phones to other inmates.\n\nThe inmates purchasing marijuana and cell phones had their friends and family pay for the items by sending Western Union money transfers to Nichols, who enlisted Davis and others to retrieve those payments. Davis obtained at least $4,300 in Western Union payments for Nichols.\n\nSolomon pleaded guilty Oct. 1, 2014, to conspiring to commit extortion under color of official right and is scheduled to be sentenced March 25. Davis pleaded guilty Oct. 21, 2014, to conspiring to commit extortion under color of official right and awaits sentencing.\n\nDwayne Harper pleaded guilty Oct. 21, 2014, to conspiring to smuggle marijuana into the Essex County Correctional Facility and awaits sentencing. Davis and Solomon have been released on bail. Harper is being held without bail in New Jersey.\n\nThe armed carjacking charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Each charge also carries a maximum fine of $250,000. Nichols agreed to forfeit $4,300 consisting of his proceeds from the contraband smuggling conspiracy. His sentencing is scheduled for May 20, 2015.", "Automotive depreciation is kind of like Robin Hood: it makes models that would regularly be available to only the rich, accessible to those with even the most laughable of bank account balances. But what good is it if the car has notoriously expensive mechanical issues? Don't worry, I got your back.\n\nThe 2002-2008 BMW 7-series was controversial to roughly the same degree that Beyonce is underrated. It had styling made by the love-him-or-hate-him Chris Bangle, and was the first car to come equipped with BMW's proprietary iDrive system, which had the user-friendliness of the Large Hadron Collider. Its long-wheelbase, fully loaded models still had technology that the current S-Class didn't have, like electric rear side window shades, six-speed automatic transmission, electronic parking brake, and an infinitely variable intake manifold. This meant that the car had some serious kit to go along with its awesome, near six-figure original price tag. But there was huge problem, and its name was BMW.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, BMW was regularly having its lunch eaten by the Mercedes S-Class, and in order to one-up the rival German automaker, they employed longer engine oil change intervals, called Condition Based Servicing, or CBS. What this meant is that new BMWs needed their oil changed once every 15,000 miles as a minimum, in an attempt to get people interested in their new line of Bangle-butts. Just as time heals all wounds, it also exposes bullshit. 15,000 miles, as it turns out, was way too long of an interval for the 4.4 and 4.8 liter N62 V8s in the 745/750i.\n\nWhat this mistake did over time was harden the engine's oil seals so that they became brittle and would leak, allowing oil where it shouldn't be - in the intake manifold and in some cases, the combustion chamber - which decreased performance and gave a noticeable plume of whitish blue smoke when running and idling. While oil seals can be potentially expensive on a regular car, they can be downright financially suicidal on a BMW as complex as this. If the problem is valve guide seals, a competent BMW dealership would likely charge between $4500 to $8,000 in labor alone.\n\nFor that reason, you can find decent used examples for well under five figures today. Seriously, check out the insane markdowns on early, fully loaded, relatively low mileage models.\n\nIf your new-to-you 7-series starts becoming a chain smoker, you have a few options and likely possible causes:\n\nReplace The Crankcase Vent Valve (CCV)\n\nThe CCV, also known as the PCV valve, allows a vacuum from the intake manifold into the crankcase, relieving pressure and saving oil seals from that excess pressure. When these parts fail, they can allow oil to seep into the intake manifold and into the combustion chamber, causing the telltate bluish-white smoke. The parts required are around $50, and the whole thing can be completed with hand tools in short order. Here's the entire procedure from start to finish:\n\nThis is another fix that involves a cheap part, but the labor is the killer. The valve guide is an integral oil seal between the combustion chamber and the cylinder head. If the above CCV fix still doesn't change your car's smoking habit, the valve guide seals may be the likely culprit. To change this part traditionally, you would have to remove both cylinder heads, which means a complete disassembly of the front of the engine, intake manifold, exhaust manifolds, and timing equipment, as well as all accessories and cooling components. This is where that near-five-figure budget for labor comes in.\n\nBy the powers of the free market, a forward-thinking company called All German Auto has developed a tool that allows you to keep your engine largely intact, cutting install time and costs by orders of magnitude. Their innovative tool costs around $850, and while it is expensive, it's absolutely everything you'll need to complete this job, other than the actual valve guide seals, which are about $50. You can always sell the tool when you're done with it, but with the price of a traditional repair method, one use of this tool would've already paid for itself. Although a good independent shop should routinely charge around $600 for a job of this size, it's something you can definitely do yourself over the course of a long weekend. Here's the entire procedure:\n\nWhile the oil burning issue isn't the only common issue this car has, it is the one that most people consider the most daunting, and one of the biggest reasons why this car has depreciated to the point where nearly anyone can afford to buy it. It's a crazy value, and if taken care of with regular 5,000 - 7,000 mile oil change intervals, it can last a long, long while.

We can hardly blame you, considering how well it held up against the Nissan GT-R and Bentley Continental GT in the Australian Outback on a recent episode of Top Gear, despite the disadvantage on driven-wheel count. But that, you see, is where Alpina comes in. The \"other M division\" offers the a twin-turbo 6 Series Gran Coupe with four-wheel traction - even here in the US - and it's just been upgraded.\n\nThe 2016 BMW Alpina B6 xDrive Gran Coupe packs a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, just like the M6. But whereas the previous B6 packed less power than its factory counterpart, the new one surpasses it. Thanks to a boost by 60 horsepower and 50 pound-feet of torque, the B6 now cranks out 600 hp and 590 lb-ft - which rather impressively bests the M6 by 40 hp and 90 lb-ft. Plus it's driven to all four wheels.\n\nThe manufacturer says that's good for a tenth of a second off the 0-60 time, now quoted at 3.6 seconds, with a top speed pegged at 200 miles per hour, making this the fastest Alpina ever offered. The 2016 B6 also benefits from new headlamps, upgraded brakes and reshaped aerodynamic elements, but it's mostly the power boost that makes this the quickest Alpina off the line in the company's history.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nShow full PR text THE NEW BMW ALPINA B6 XDRIVE GRAN COUPE\n\nEnhancements for 2016 model year deliver more power and refinement than ever.\n\nWoodcliff Lake, N.J. -February 11, 2015... The new 2016 model year BMW ALPINA B6 xDrive Gran Coupe gains subtle BMW enhancements and benefits in particular from the results of continuous development by ALPINA. The four-door Gran Coupe, already widely recognized for aesthetic beauty and impressive driving performance, raises the benchmark with exciting new details. The new BMW ALPINA B6 xDrive Gran Coupe will become available to order starting in March 2015, with US deliveries slated to begin at BMW Centers in June. Pricing will be announced closer to the on-sale date.\n\nThe BMW ALPINA B6 xDrive Gran Coupe is available as a special-order vehicle with capacity-limited production underscoring its exclusivity. The B6's body is manufactured in the BMW 6 Series factory (Plant Dingolfing) and hand-finished with the remaining ALPINA components at the ALPINA factory in Buchloe, Germany. The hand-finishing sequence at ALPINA increases the production lead-time by approximately two weeks. European Delivery at the BMW Welt delivery center is available for the BMW ALPINA B6, as is BMW Performance Center Delivery in Greer, SC, USA.\n\nA more-dynamic front spoiler and fascia enclose the subtly-revised BMW kidney grill, and shape the transition to the new ALPINA hood which features character chines, lending the new B6 xDrive Gran Coupe an even more powerful appearance and accentuate its class-leading performance potential.\n\nThe 4.4 liter V8 Bi-Turbo V-8 engine - known amongst aficionados as the embodiment of power, torque and refinement - now delivers an astonishing 600 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and maximum torque of 590 lb-ft at only 3,500 rpm (all figures preliminary). The increase in output of 60 hp over the 2015 model has been achieved through extensive rework of the air intake ducting and air filter housing, with enhancements to the fuel supply system. Coupling the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive system with an ALPINA-developed performance calibration means the new B6 xDrive Gran Coupe delivers heroic straight-line performance. With a 0 - 60 mph acceleration time of only 3.6 seconds (preliminary), it is the fastest-accelerating BMW ALPINA model ever developed. The new B6 xDrive Gran Coupe is capable of a maximum speed of 200 mph (electronically limited).\n\nThe ALPINA sport suspension utilizes BMW's advanced electronic suspension technologies including Dynamic Damper Control (adjustable, adaptive shock absorbers) and Adaptive Drive (Active Roll Stabilization), which work together with the fully-variable torque distribution of the all-wheel drive system to achieve very neutral, agile driving dynamics.\n\nThe powerful brake system now features blue calipers with ALPINA lettering on the front axle with brake discs measuring 374 x 36 mm on the front and 370 x 24 on the rear (increased from 345 x 24 mm).\n\nThe standard equipment level has been extended to include attractive features such as Full LED Adaptive Headlights with High Beam Assistant, and a discrete new B6 model designation in the B-pillar in high-gloss Shadow Line.\n\nRefined performance with powerful delivery.\n\nContinuous development of the 4.4 liter V8 Bi-Turbo V-8 engine has resulted in a number of upgrades leading to a significant increase in power output in the new B6 xDrive Gran Coupe. The engine now develops 600 hp at 6,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 590 lb-ft between 3,500 and 4,500 rpm (preliminary figures).\n\nTwo specifically-constructed, large-diameter turbochargers, operating in parallel, are primarily responsible for achieving a high power and torque output over a very broad engine speed range, without sacrificing spontaneous throttle response at low rpm. The high-performance water-air intercooler system with a short intake distances consists of a large-volume low-temperature heat exchanger, and two near-engine intercoolers. Additional oil and water coolers are located just behind the front spoiler to ensure overall thermodynamic efficiency of the engine. Extensive optimization of the air intake ducting and air filter housing leads to a substantial reduction of losses, which together with an upgraded fuel supply system results in the hike in output of 60 hp over the previous model year.\n\nInside the cylinders, specific MAHLE pistons are designed to deal with temperatures and pressures associated with up to 1.2 bar (17.4 psi) boost pressure and the engine's 10.0:1 nominal compression ratio.\n\nALPINA-tuned 8-speed Sport Automatic transmission.\n\nAdapted and tested in co-operation with ZF, the advanced ALPINA SWITCH-TRONIC 8-Speed Sport Automatic transmission is perfectly tailored to the power and torque of the V-8 Bi-Turbo engine. It excels equally in the disciplines sport and comfort, playing a central role in infusing the B6 xDrive Gran Coupe with ALPINA typical characteristics.\n\nIn Automatic (D) Shift Mode, the flexible blend of eight speeds and high torque makes for smooth gear changes only a torque converter can provide. Explicitly programmed for comfort, the B6 Bi-Turbo Gran Coupe glides effortlessly and efficiently at low engine speed and tall gears, offering unmatched cruising ability.\n\nIn Sport (S) Shift Mode, the transmission becomes significantly more dynamic, gear changes are executed faster and feedback becomes more direct. The system allows for multi-simultaneous downshifts in only milliseconds, wherein the transmission will skip several gears depending on engine loads and speeds to select the most favorable gear for optimum acceleration.\n\nThe Manual (M) Shift Mode allows full driver control over the transmission. The ALPINA SWITCH-TRONIC buttons are ergonomically mounted on the rear of the steering wheel, their actuation allowing the driver to shift up or down as required. A unique feature of the transmission software in Manual (M) Shift Mode in combination with the selection of Sport+ or DSC OFF Mode using the Driving Dynamics Control button is the cancellation of automatic upshift function. In this mode of operation, the transmission will maintain the selected gear up to maximum engine speed and will not automatically upshift to the next gear. This is desirable in certain driving situations, for example during especially dynamic driving on roads with multiple tight hair-pin corners, or on race track segments featuring pronounced elevation change.\n\nHardware modifications to the transmission, output and driveshafts enable unrestrained power delivery. In combination with the single-cylinder fade-out and ALPINA specific software modifications, this eliminates the common reduction of torque required by the transmission in order to up-shift. This allows super-quick upshifts under full loads which, together with xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive, means the B6 xDrive Gran Coupe requires only 3.6 seconds for the sprint from 0 - 60 mph (preliminary).\n\nBMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive.\n\nThe ALPINA all-wheel drive system exploits the technical potential of BMW's xDrive system and its intelligent, dynamic distribution of drive power which continuously and variably distributes torque between the front and rear axle within milliseconds, for a maximum of traction and control.\n\nFor the BMW ALPINA B6 xDrive Gran Coupe, the programming of the torque distribution control system, which is interconnected with the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and engine management system, is performance-oriented and increases driving agility and dynamics - especially under lateral acceleration - while maintaining a neutral balance. Besides allowing optimum traction under acceleration by eliminating slip-induced losses, the system continuously monitors a wide range of sensory inputs - for example steering angle, lateral acceleration, yaw angle and speed - to distribute torque to achieve maximum safety in challenging conditions or when encountering sudden changes in road surface friction.\n\nExhaust system.\n\nThe B6 xDrive Gran Coupe features a full stainless steel exhaust system with ALPINA trademark elliptical twin tailpipes. The character of the deep exhaust note is prominent but not intrusive. Active exhaust valves allow balance between enthusiasm and comfort on long journeys. The driver can influence the sound experience using the Driving Dynamics Control button. In Comfort Mode, the exhaust valve is closed up to 2,500 rpm, and in Sport Mode the valve is permanently open.\n\nChassis, wheels, and tires.\n\nBMW ALPINA automobiles place special demands on chassis and suspension - requiring high levels of comfort for relaxed cruising, light-footed and dynamic agility for purposeful driving as well as safe and neutral handling at high speeds.\n\nThe B6 xDrive Gran Coupe's chassis and suspension technology builds upon the basis of a BMW double-wishbone front suspension and integral rear axle. Furthermore it utilizes sophisticated electronic suspension technologies including Dynamic Damper Control (adjustable, adaptive shock absorbers) and Adaptive Drive (BMW Active Roll Stabilization). This allows the driver to change the chassis and suspension settings distinctly between Comfort+, Comfort, Sport, and Sport+ using the Driving Dynamics Control rocker switch.\n\nThe ALPINA-specific calibration of dampers and stabilizers is tied into other system parameters including torque distribution, stability control, steering assistance, and throttle response.\n\nStiffer springs and increased front wheel camber, combined with the 20\" staggered ALPINA CLASSIC wheel and tire set, result in direct steering response and precise handling. The high performance MICHELIN Pilot Super Sport tires forego run-flat technology in order to maximize comfort and they have a high speed rating to allow for the B6 xDrive Gran Coupe's maximum possible speed of 200 mph. The dimensions of the rear wheel and tire have increased to 10\" x 20\" and 295/30 ZR20 for improved traction while the front dimensions remain at 8.5\" x 20\" and 255/35 ZR 20.\n\nAll season tires measuring 255/35 front and 285/30 rear are available as a factory option. Vehicles supplied with this option from the factory have a non-removable limited top speed of 130 mph. ALPINA recommends the appropriate use of performance summer tires and winter tires according to weather conditions for the best performance, handling and safety of your BMW ALPINA vehicle.\n\nExterior design.\n\nThe ALPINA design features blend seamlessly and stylishly into the surfaces and lines of the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe, accentuating its dynamic, graceful silhouette.\n\nA new, more aggressive front spoiler and apron enclose the subtly-changed BMW kidney grill and shape the transition to the new hood with character chines. These lend the new B6 xDrive Gran Coupe an even more authoritative appearance and hint at the enormous performance potential of the V-8 Bi-Turbo engine.\n\nThe design and shape of the new ALPINA front spoiler ensures the effective flow of sufficient air to the radiator modules of the performance cooling-system, including inter-cooler, water and oil. A subtle, integrated splitter directs air over and around rather than underneath the vehicle, thereby stabilizing the front end at high speeds.\n\nSpecial NACA air channels at the front of the underbody suck cold air towards the powerful brake system with blue calipers which are visible through the delicate spokes of the ALPINA CLASSIC 20\" wheels. Large diameter brake discs measuring 374 x 36 mm on the front and 370 x 24 mm on the rear (up from 345 x 24 mm) guarantee effective brake performance.\n\nInterior & equipment.\n\nThe new B6 xDrive Gran Coupe has a comprehensive, comfort orientated range of standard equipment, a luxurious interior, and only the highest-quality materials. Nappa leather and a leather instrument panel remain standard in addition to essential features such as electric comfort seats. The BMW Navigation system with BMW ConnectedDrive services is also standard.\n\nBlue ALPINA instrumentation, an ALPINA steering wheel covered in hand-stitched LAVALINA leather, the ALPINA production plaque overhead, door sill trims with blue illuminated ALPINA lettering, and the classic ALPINA luxury wood trim in Myrtle or Piano lacquer - these are some of the exclusive features of the B6 xDrive Gran Coupe's interior.\n\nBMW Group In America\n\nBMW of North America, LLC has been present in the United States since 1975.

It's been about Greece and any resolution they can get there. And it's been about oil and that is why the markets are pushing to where they are,\" he said.\n\nThe earnings season has also clearly played a role, as well. Stephanie Link, chief investment officer and director of research at TheStreet.com, noted the earnings picture over the last several weeks has been pretty good, especially in the tech sector. \"I like the fact that we are seeing both new technology and old technology companies performing well right now,\" she said. \"Those stocks continue to be very attractive and a place to put money.\"\n\nApple is one place where investors are putting their money. The stock hit a new 52-week high on Thursday. But despite its strong performance, Icahn wants the company to not only invest in its growth but to also do a stock buyback.\n\nA number of the panelists agreed that Apple should buy back some of its stock and issue a dividend, given the cash it has on hand, but they largely support the decisions Apple has made in the way it has been deploying its capital. Ichan is \"dead right,\" said Josh Brown, CEO and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management. \"But you can't be dissatisfied in the moves the company has been making with its capital.\"\n\nAnd while Bridgewater Associates has cut its Apple holdings in half as of the end of last year, Najarian wasn't too concerned, attributing that move to the investment firm as taking profits off the table.\n\nTesla's disappointing fourth-quarter results and plummeting stock price apparently are not deterring all investors. Cathie Wood, CEO and founder of ARK Investment Management, said she is charging ahead and snapping up more shares of the electric-vehicle maker. Tesla now represents 6% of ARK's holdings and comprises the largest piece in two of ARK's portfolios.\n\nShe pointed to Tesla's three-year lead over other car manufacturers in developing a small consumer electronics battery to power electric vehicles. Wood believes that eventually, other automakers such as General Motors , Ford and others, will want to use Tesla's battery patents for their vehicles.\n\nWood also noted that Tesla sales are 1.7 times those of BMW's Series 7 cars in the U.S. And with Tesla preparing to unveil its Tesla X model in the next six months, expanding its offerings beyond its Tesla S, she is already speculating about how far it could go with a larger lineup. If Tesla were to extend its line of offerings to something comparable to that of all the BMW series, she said, the company could deliver 1.1 million vehicles by 2020.", "ATLANTA -- Whitney Houston's daughter was involved in a traffic accident that injured two people days before she was found face-down in a bathtub, according to a police report obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nBobbi Kristina Brown lost control of her Jeep Liberty when a tire blew out on Jan. 27, crossing into oncoming traffic and colliding with another vehicle.

New seats that are ventilated and/or heated are now available both up front and in the back while for cold weather purposes a steering wheel that heats up is recommended and also available.\n\nSince this is a car aiming at family men and women, the entertainment options for the rear seats are focused around a 9\" display, a new audio system and bigger screen for the driver as well (8 inches/20 cm).\n\nOn the powertrain front, the new 3.5-liter V6 engine will have cylinder deactivation that should drive the fuel consumption figures down but we don't have any performance figures at the hand right now.

In 2014 strong sales of premium tyres offset weakness in Latin America.\n\nPirelli has been focussing since 2010 on more upmarket tyres for brands such as Mercedes , Audi, and BMW - luxury carmakers which have weathered the downturn better than their mainstream rivals. Pirelli's sales volumes of premium tyres increased by nearly 18 percent last year.\n\nThe company forecast 2015 earnings before interest and tax, after restructuring costs, of around 930 million euros (689 million pounds). It expects to grow revenues by up to 6.5 percent to around 6.4 billion euros, while investments are seen at below 400 million euros.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Chairman and CEO Marco Tronchetti Provera confirmed the company's policy to distribute around 40 percent of net profits in dividends. Should the cash generation continue, the board may consider a higher dividend or a buyback, but no decision had been taken at this stage.\n\nTronchetti Provera also said Pirelli continues its search for a partner in Asia for its truck business.\n\n\"We hope that in 2015 we will be able to start the process with some of the players we are in touch with,\" he said, without elaborating.\n\nEarlier on Thursday Pirelli said 2014 operating profit rose 6.8 percent to 838 million euros helped by its focus on higher-margin products, a better price mix and efficiency measures.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a 837 million euro operating profit, according to a consensus provided by the company.\n\nRevenues stood at 6.02 billion euros, down from 6.06 billion the previous year and compared with an analyst consensus of 6.05 billion euros.\n\nThe Italian group's figures compare with weaker results from France's Michelin , which has a bigger exposure to mass-market tyres. Michelin pledged to step up cost-cutting efforts after cut-price competition hit profits more than expected last year.\n\nPirelli's results were released after market closed on Thursday. The stock, which is up 12 percent in the year to date, closed up 2.4 percent at 12.9 euros earlier in the session.\n\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak; editing by Jane Merriman and Elaine Hardcastle)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nPirelli forecasts 11 percent profit rise in 2015 on strong premium sales - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "Washington (AFP) - General Motors' Chevrolet division announced Thursday it would take into production the all-electric Bolt that it introduced in January as a concept car.\n\nTaking on popular, but more expensive long-range electrics like the Tesla and BMW's i3, GM North America President Alan Batey said the company is moving to production quickly \"because of its potential to completely shake up the status quo for electric vehicles.\"\n\n\"The message from consumers about the Bolt EV concept was clear and unequivocal: Build it,\" said Batey.\n\nAs unveiled at the Detroit auto show last month, the Bolt is a hatchback-looking \"small crossover\" that lowers the price of entry to a full-range electric to as low as $30,000 (once various tax breaks that some states give buyers are counted).\n\nThat would put it as a direct competitor to the electric sedan being developed by Tesla in the same price range. Tesla's current electric car, the luxury Model S, starts at around $70,000.\n\nChevrolet says the new car will be able to go 200 miles (320 kilometers) on a charge, five times farther than its five-year-old Volt plug-in electric.\n\nThe new car will be built at General Motors' Orion Assembly facility near Detroit, and is expected to hit the market in 2017.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nGM commits to produce Chevrolet Bolt electric car - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "NEW YORK: How far does electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc have to go to reach its goal of matching Apple Inc's current market value? It would take 26 years, based on rough calculations by Reuters, unless it starts selling a lot more cars.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk surprised analysts on the company's earnings call on Wednesday by saying that his company could be worth $700 billion by 2025. That is roughly the same size as Apple Inc, the most valuable company in the Standard and Poor's 500 index, is worth now.\n\nInvestors were quick to point out that reaching that goal would require a jump of 2,700 per cent in the value of Tesla's shares, given its market value of $26.6 billion.\n\nActually, at its current annual production rate of 55,000 cars a year, the company would have to sell every car until 2040 to get to that market cap.\n\nMore likely, Musk expects the production rate to expand, but the question is by how much? Today, every Tesla car represents $463,636 in market cap.

James MacIntosh. When the vehicle was eventually moved onto Windbeam Road, MacIntosh said, the driver was identified as 41-year-old Roy Delosangeles.\n\nWhile speaking with Delosangeles, the patrolman detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath, while also observing a flushed face and bloodshot eyes, according to MacIntosh.\n\nHe said Delosangeles admitted to drinking alcohol earlier in the evening.

Benny Booker, 29, was found in the doorway of Nichols' home and was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead a short while later.\n\nBoth men were fatally shot to death.

That changed when six body armor-clad Department of Homeland Security agents and local police officers showed up at her North Carolina home and blocked her driveway. They were there because of an arbitrary law promulgated 26 years ago to guard the prerogatives -- and profits -- of automakers and car dealers. Specifically, they were there to take Brinkley's truck.\n\n\"They wouldn't even tell me why it was being seized,\" said Brinkley, who lives near Charlotte. Though she didn't understand what was happening, she reluctantly complied with the agents' request. \"If you're a law-abiding citizen, what can you do?\" she said.\n\nAround 6 a.m. that same day in Yakima, Wash., and Mobile, Ala., Homeland Security agents and police came to the homes of Mike Rodeiger and Jack Montgomery, respectively, with warrants that ordered more truck seizures. Montgomery, an attorney, said they threatened to arrest him for obstruction of justice if he or his family took photos of them.\n\n\"It was disgusting,\" said Montgomery, an attorney who asked Jalopnik to alter his last name for this story, out of fear that the incident could harm his legal practice. \"It's beyond weird. Weird would be a nice word for it. This is thuggery.\"\n\nIn a series of pre-dawn raids that morning in July, agents scoured the country for 40 Land Rovers in an ongoing civil forfeiture case. All of them were older; all of them were the rugged Defender models; and all of them had originated outside the U.S. and were imported here in the last few years by the same man -- but in a way that authorities say may have violated America's strict car import laws.\n\nSince that day in July, federal authorities have seized even more Defenders around the country. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials allege that all of the vehicles are not in compliance with America's vehicle importation laws, which stipulate that a car must be more than 25 years old to be legally imported here from another country.\n\nBut each of the Defenders in this case is now at least 26 years old, according to court documents and several owners who spoke with Jalopnik. Many of the seized trucks were in rough condition or in the process of being repaired or restored. Brinkley was the fourth owner of her Land Rover since it had been imported into the U.S.; at first she had no clue why federal agents would want a run-down vehicle she calls \"a glorified tractor.\"\n\nRoediger's 1986 Land Rover was in a state of disrepair at a body shop, but the agents wanted it after inspecting it there and declaring it had a bogus Vehicle Identification Number. They said the truck was in reality much newer than a 1986 model, which meant it was in violation of the law when it was shipped to America.\n\n\"I said, 'How can that be?'\" Roediger said. \"'Look at the frame. It's even got rust.' They said that could be faked.\"\n\n.\n\nMonths after the seizures, a fight to get the Defenders back is being waged in federal court by Will Hedrick, a Land Rover enthusiast and bankruptcy lawyer by day who has taken on the case pro bono.\n\nHedrick said the government, as well as Jaguar Land Rover North America, made more than a few errors in supplying and interpreting the information that led to the seizure of the cars. So far, he's made a lot of progress. Six of the seized Land Rovers have been returned through his efforts.\n\nDespite the seemingly long odds of taking on the federal government by himself, Hedrick is working to get the case dismissed outright, and if not, he said, a trial could possibly happen sometime this year.\n\n\"I think they expected to find a bunch of VIN-swapped vehicles,\" he said. \"That's not the case.\"\n\nHedrick's case contends that the cars are currently of legal age, making their seizure \"moot.\" He also argues that each vehicle was within a few months of being 25 years old when it was imported -- and that the law measures age from the model year, not its date of manufacture.\n\nThe seized trucks were all imported into the U.S. by the same man, Aaron Richardet, a North Carolina chiropractor. Ostensibly, the seizures occurred as part of a possible criminal case being built against Richardet, but so far he has not been charged with anything. Richardet told Jalopnik he believes he imported all of the Defenders correctly and broke no laws.\n\nOfficials from Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on this case specifically, but said in an email that they and other agencies from the United Kingdom have been targeting imported Defenders and Mini Coopers they believe aren't in compliance with the law as part of a program called Operation Atlantic. This operation has led to several prosecutions in both countries, they said.\n\nBut to the owners of the Defenders, their seizures are a gross violation of their property rights, an overreach by the government that hasn't been explained to them very well. Federal officials say they're just taking unsafe and illegal cars off the road, and doing so in connection with an investigation into a man who hasn't been charged with breaking any laws and might not be.\n\n\"But what if he's innocent?\" Brinkley said of Richardet. \"What happens to our trucks then?\"\n\nThe Land Rover Defender is a far cry from the modern, high-tech, leather-lined Land Rovers that are fixtures at every Neiman Marcus parking lot -- and that's a big reason the vehicle has such a cult following.\n\nIt's a boxy, rugged, truck-like 4x4, stripped out and basic, mechanically simple and easy to work on. But it's also the closest modern thing to the old safari-ready offroaders that come to mind when someone mentions the name \"Land Rover.\"\n\nThe truck was launched in the 1980s as a revival of the company's old adventure vehicles, but it was only sold in the American market for a brief few years in the mid-1990s.\n\nThis has led many of its American fans to import older ones from the UK or other countries. The Defender still rolls off the assembly lines in the United Kingdom, although to the sadness of many, 2015 will be its last year of production.\n\nPristine Defenders can get expensive, but many of the Defenders in this case are far from pristine. They're all 1980s models that have already done what they were built to do -- go where normal cars cannot.\n\n\"It has this iconic look it's had for 50 years,\" said Zak Mosieur of Portland, who imports Defenders and diesel engine kits. This also makes it hard to determine their age.\n\n\"At a glance, the trucks all look the same,\" Mosieur said. \"You can't really tell the difference.\"\n\nIn fact, due to the Defender's longevity and modular nature -- it's built for farm and military duty, after all -- many exporters will sell trucks with newer doors, body panels, or interior parts grafted onto older vehicles. Some are on their second or third engine.\n\nTelling their true age is hard because so many different parts may have been grafted onto the original frame, which along with the engine is what really matters where import laws are concerned.\n\nUntil the 1980s, Americans were mostly free to import just about any car they wanted into the U.S. Luxury cars, often with engines or options not available in the U.S. market, were among the most popular choices for so-called \"grey imports.\"\n\nBut because these imports were moving through unofficial distribution channels, they started eating into automakers' profits. After Mercedes-Benz and other car companies spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress, lawmakers passed rules in 1988 that heavily restricted the importation of foreign cars.\n\nToday there are really only a few legal ways to import a foreign car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the vehicle safety arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, requires that a vehicle be 25 years old or older (or already compliant with U.S. safety regulations, like a U.S.-spec vehicle sold abroad) for safety reasons. The Environmental Protection Agency requires the vehicle or engine be 21 years old or older for emissions.\n\nOfficially, the reason for these laws is to keep vehicles that don't meet America's strict safety and smog-control laws out of the U.S, and to prevent polluting and unsafe vehicles from endangering lives. Customs officials said in an email that they also fear the importation of stolen goods into the U.S., something they claim happens in \"many instances.\"\n\nBut critics, car collectors, aspiring enthusiasts and would-be importers have derided the laws as protectionist and arbitrary. Some vehicles can be imported under what's called the \"show or display\" law, but that is limited to an approved list of certain cars and restricts how they can be used.\n\nFor example, an American cannot import a new Volkswagen Scirocco from Germany because it isn't sold here and hasn't been crash tested in America, even though it's mechanically similar to the Volkswagen Golf sold in the U.S. and has a top five-star crash rating in the European New Car Assessment Programme crash tests.\n\nA new European BMW M3 can't be imported here, either, even though it has an equivalent version in the U.S., because it's not American-spec. With modern cars this often means small details, like the color of the turn-signal indicators.\n\nWhat if someone wanted to import a 2001 Nissan Skyline GT-R to the U.S., a car that's long been regarded as forbidden fruit among enthusiasts? Is it any less safe than an American-market Nissan from the same year? Importers who wish to bring the Skyline or other cars to the U.S. must pay to have several of them crash tested first to certify they're safe, destroying them in the process, an expensive and time-consuming process.\n\nCanada, which has safety standards that are often identical to the ones in the United States, allows cars that are 15 years or older to be imported.\n\nAnd when it comes to emissions, while many new European cars feature smaller and cleaner engines than ones we get, they can't be imported here because they haven't been tested and certified by the EPA and because our government views emissions differently than do Europeans.\n\nAs for the 1980s Defenders in this case, a 1981 version of the car isn't substantially different from a later model and not necessarily more or less safe than an SUV sold in the U.S. in the same period. It may even be safer than, say, a small car from the 1990s, due to its sheer size.\n\nAnd some of the upgrades on these Defenders to make them safer and cleaner -- more modern engines, newer parts -- are being adduced as evidence against the cars.\n\nIt's not clear exactly how many vehicles Americans attempt to import each year, or how many are rejected for not meeting legal requirements. Jalopnik filed an Freedom of Information Act request in late December seeking that data, but it has not been fulfilled yet. Customs officials said in an email that Operation Atlantic alone has had \"interventions\" with $1 million worth of vehicles.\n\nSome importers try to skirt these rules, illegally, by swapping the VIN from an older car onto a newer one. That's what federal officials allege happened with a 2000 Mini Cooper in New Jersey in December; they claim that car had a 1988 VIN plate that belied its modern stereo and airbags, which is why they had to crush it in a kind of public display of how the law must be enforced.\n\nBecause of its iconic status and its scarcity in the U.S., the Defender has been a popular choice for importation. In this country, low-mileage, great condition Defenders can go for as much as $100,000.\n\nIt's also a top choice for importers looking to make a buck by selling trucks that aren't really up to U.S. specs at first glance.\n\n\"As of April 2014, the entry of 369 Land Rover vehicles declared as exempt because of their age had been reviewed by NHTSA,\" prosecuting Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve West wrote in one filing. \"Approximately 20 percent of these vehicles were found not eligible for the exemption and 14 percent of the Land Rover vehicles reviewed exhibited evidence that their VINs were removed, obliterated, tampered with, or altered.\"\n\nAs such, they've been targeted by federal authorities for years now. From a 2013 Car and Driver story:\n\nChecking the VIN, or vehicle identification number, is the first -- and traditionally only -- stop for verifying a vehicle's age. In the Defender, VINs appear in two spots: There's one on the chassis, and another VIN plate on the casing of the brake booster. In most cases, the original VINs are ground off the newer Defender and a VIN from a 25-year-old European Defender -- one on the road still, or one rusting away in a field somewhere -- is etched in.\n\nWith NHTSA's guidance, customs officials have caught many of these. This is a black-and-white case of breaking the rules, but there are murkier situations.\n\nIn 2013, customs officials said they seized \"dozens\" of Defenders believed to be illegal at ports in Philadelphia, Norfolk, Houston, Tacoma and several other cities. Many of those trucks, officials said, had altered VINs.\n\nBy some accounts, Richardet, the chiropractor who imported the cars involved in the most recent seizures, was one of the top importers of Defenders in the country. Court documents state that from 2009 to 2012, he imported 114 Defenders into the country for sale through a licensed dealer called Patterson Auto Sales in Wilmington, N.C. (The dealership declined to comment when reached by phone.)\n\nAccording to a complaint filed by Department of Homeland Security investigators, federal authorities began looking into Richardet and his imported Defenders in September 2012.\n\nThe complaint says customs inspectors at the port in Wilmington found what they said were issues with one 1983 and one 1986 model Richardet had brought in. Those included the presence of disc brakes, a diesel engine that wasn't in production until the late 1990s, interior and exterior features only found on later cars, a transfer box from a 2004 Defender and other discrepancies.\n\nObviously, this made authorities wonder if the vehicles were not what Richardet said they were, so they launched an investigation. In an email to his broker, Richardet said that both vehicles had simply undergone restorations and modifications \"to make them safer and more user friendly,\" hence the newer parts. He went on:\n\nThe Truck was taken down to the frame. It was sand blasted then galvanized to prevent rust. The doors are prone to rust are scrapped and swapped out for newer ones. The old dashes have been out of production since 2004 so the newer dash is used if the old one is bad. The restoration shops try to make modifications and upgrades to the trucks to make them safer and more user friendly. Just like restoring an old camero [sic] old parts get junked and newer go one. I hope he will see that. All those parts are available from land rover and the truck has changed so little you can bolt them right on.\n\nThe complaint says that in October 2012, investigators started probing further, sending a list of the 110 Defenders to both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and to Jaguar Land Rover North America. They sought to determine whether the VINs matched with their respective cars, and whether the vehicles really complied with U.S. safety and emissions standards. (A source at Jaguar Land Rover North America confirmed that federal authorities issued a subpoena for that information.)\n\nDocuments filed by prosectors say investigators sent a Jaguar Land Rover North America safety compliance manager a list of the VINs of the vehicles Richardet had imported and asked him to identify their true date of manufacture. The safety manager included several details about the trucks, including their engine number and type, transmission, rear axle, transfer box number, original color, country of manufacture and the country where they were first delivered.\n\nThe manager sent the list along the following January. From there, the complaint says, investigators determined that 51 of the 114 Defenders were ineligible to be here because the date of production and the importation date both fell within the 25-year window. In March 2013, they seized 20 Defenders at Richardet's house, according to a local news report.\n\nAfter months of surveillance, they came for the rest of them. Of the 51 vehicles, 40 were listed in the warrant. Eight were not found. (Six were later dismissed from the case and returned to owners after Hedrick's legal efforts.)\n\nAuthorities allege Richardet either lied about their age in his forms or imported them before they were the right age. Investigators decided that the Defenders \"are, by their very nature, contraband and, thus, subject to seizure,\" according to the complaint.\n\nBut if the trucks were illegal, how were they even getting through customs in the first place?\n\nThat's possibly because customs officers don't thoroughly investigate everything that comes into port. Prosecutor West said in one of his court filings that this was because Richardet allegedly submitted fraudulent documents when he brought the trucks in, and customs officials had no way of knowing otherwise because he was submitting supposedly false information to them. West's take on the inspection process hardly inspires confidence:\n\nCBP Officers do not perform intensive, intrusive examinations of every item imported into the United States. Such an approach would require an unacceptable level of resources, would unnecessarily slow legitimate commerce, and could pose a threat to our nation's economic security.\n\n(The trucks were, however, inspected and registered by the state of North Carolina.)\n\nAnd yet there remains a great disparity between how customs officials inspect imported goods, and how they crack down on cars they think are non-compliant. Owners have questioned how inspecting imported goods constitutes an \"unacceptable level of resources,\" but having federal agents sweep the country with the help of local police to seize 40 trucks is not.\n\nWhile federal officials didn't respond to calls and emails for comment, their philosophy on vehicles believed to be illegal is tied to vague notions of \"safety\" in their news releases on the crushing of the Mini Cooper last year:\n\n\"Safety is the U.S. Department of Transportation's top priority and we are committed to preventing the illegal importation of vehicles and exposing their potential safety risks,\" said Nancy Lewis, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration associate administrator for enforcement. \"Along with our partners at CBP and CTAC, we'll remain diligent in our enforcement efforts to protect the driving public.\"\n\nExactly how these cars are such a threat to public safety isn't made clear. Again, it speaks to the arbitrary nature of the law: Why is it perfectly legal to import a 1970 Mini Cooper, but illegal to import a newer one with airbags and modern smog controls?\n\nReached by phone, Richardet was reluctant to talk about any possible pending legal actions against him, or whether he had been charged or indicted. He did say that he started out as a longtime Defender enthusiast and decided to import them on the side. Since then he's seen his own Defenders get taken, has lost \"a ton of money,\" and has had to deal with the guilt of the other owners' seizures.\n\n\"This was just a hobby,\" he said. \"It wasn't my business... I don't like how this went for anybody.\"\n\nRichardet did say that contrary to many of the rumors flying around, nothing truly illegal was going on with the trucks that might have raised the eyebrows of federal investigators -- there was no smuggling of guns or drugs or anything like that.\n\nHe also insisted that every one of the Defenders he imported was of legal age when he did it, and said he followed the letter and spirit of the law.\n\n\"I did everything they asked me to,\" Richardet said. \"Everything they asked for, they were given.\"\n\nRichardet had nothing but high praise for Hedrick, and said he hopes he prevails in court. \"Will knows I'm pulling for him,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously, I hope all the cars get back to their owners, and they should get back,\" Richardet said. \"But as for the inner workings of the case, I don't know.\"\n\nHedrick said the majority of Richardet-imported Defenders in his case were not restored and were sold as is, which is to say they were in whatever shape they happened to be in at the time they were purchased. The importer may have done some fixes, but none were on par with top restorations. At least six were purchased as bundles of parts, and some couldn't pass inspection in the U.K.\n\nBrinkley said her Defender, purchased a year ago, needed months of rebuilding before it came back to her. She only had it six months before it was seized.\n\nRoediger bought his Defender from Richardet in 2011 through Patterson Auto Sales. It was the second time he had attempted to do so. Back in 2009, he nearly completed the purchase of another Defender from the chiropractor, only to back out when he discovered it maybe didn't have its original engine, but instead a motor that may not have been 21 years old.\n\nRoediger described his experience buying from the chiropractor as \"kind of mixed.\"\n\n\"I felt like (Richardet) was being a bit unethical about some of his engines,\" he said. At the same time, Richardet was thorough and helpful with the buying process, and got back to him quickly when he asked questions following the sale. Roediger thinks it's possible Richardet was just being \"sloppy\" with the years of the engines and when they were eligible for import.\n\nHe's not representing Richardet, but Hedrick said that because an importer has to sign a sworn declaration at customs, the chiropractor could potentially be charged with some type of fraud. (Recently, a Mississippi man who illegally imported a 2001 Nissan Skyline to the U.S. was charged with smuggling goods, along with several counts of wire fraud related to an attempt to sell the car.)\n\nBut then prosecutors would have to prove that he knowingly brought the trucks over in violation of the law, and wasn't just sloppy with his paperwork.\n\nIf any attorney is equipped to fight this fight, it's probably Hedrick. He's a longtime Defender enthusiast worked at a Land Rover dealership in sales before going to law school.\n\nHedrick first heard about the seizures on the Internet and was soon contacted by a friend of his brother's who'd had his Defender taken away. He started looking into that owner's legal recourse and posted on the Defender Source forum that he could do the same for other Defender fans.\n\nThe response exceeded his wildest expectations. Over the next few months, every person whose vehicle was seized that day in July -- many of whom weren't even forum members -- reached out, too.\n\nHedrick contends in his court case that mistakes were made in reading at least some of the vehicles' VINs, wrongfully identifying their age, and that the government has offered no justifiable proof that the VINs were incorrect at all.\n\n\"I knew there was something wrong with the way they were being researched,\" Hedrick said.\n\nHedrick said Land Rover ran searches on Richardet's trucks based only on the last six digits of the VIN, a sequence that is the vehicle's serial number and thus may repeat for certain models after a number of years. A Defender from the 1980s could have the same final six digits as a newer one. In one filing, prosecutors confirmed the six trucks \"had been misidentified by Jaguar Land Rover.\"\n\nDarren Smith, who runs an awards and engraving business in Wake Forest, said the seizure warrants listed his Defender as a 2000 model when it clearly wasn't.\n\n\"Anyone with a hint of common sense could tell that wasn't the case\" by looking at the haggard old truck he calls \"Frankenrover,\" Smith said. His 1983 Defender was among the six returned after it was seized.\n\nIn an email found in the court documents, prosecutor West said that after Land Rover ran the entire VIN, those six trucks were found to be more than 25 years from production at the time of import. He agreed to their dismissal and return.\n\nThis makes Hedrick and others watching the case wonder: What else did Land Rover get wrong?\n\n\"I see a lot of mistakes made along the way in what they provided,\" Hedrick said. In addition, he said the VINs come not from Land Rover itself but from the Heritage Motor Centre in England, so he's seen \"no records to substantiate their authenticity.\"\n\nProsecutors in their filings take a similar tack, but in reverse -- they say there's no evidence to indicate all of Richardet's trucks were legal when he brought them in.\n\nHedrick's case will try to show the government hasn't proven the trucks violated the law when they were imported. \"There's never been anything presented in the government's case as to their non-compliance,\" he said. And even so, he'll argue the vehicles should be returned and allowed to stay because they're all now at least 26 years old.\n\nIt's on him to prove this. In criminal law, a suspect is presumed innocent until the state proves him or her guilty, and the burden is up to the state to do so beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBut in civil forfeiture, Hedrick says, that principle is turned on its head -- the property is presumed \"guilty\" and its owner faces the burden of proving that it's more likely \"innocent\" than not. \"In forfeiture, all the government has to show is probable cause that a crime was committed. Then the claimant has to show it was not,\" he said.\n\nMost forfeiture cases go uncontested, he said, because the property in question is something no owner would want to claim -- drugs or weapons, for instance. In other instances, people often give up because the legal process gets so expensive.\n\n\"You're going to spend more money to get your property back than it's worth,\" Hedrick said.\n\nIn this case, the Defender owners don't have to worry about that because Hedrick is working the case for free, but they are concerned about the state of their vehicles, many of which are scattered across the country in government impound lots. About a third are in \"various states of disassembly,\" Hedrick said. One of his clients told he even saw an engine getting dragged across the floor until it was loaded onto a flatbed.\n\n\"Mine's going to end up doing border patrols down in Texas,\" Brinkley joked.\n\nWhat has owners truly perplexed is what prompted the investigation into Richardet in the first place, as well as the crackdown on Defenders as a whole. Montgomery wonders why priorities were placed on a coordinated, nationwide seizure of cars by customs officials around the same time the country was dealing with a humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of children came flooding across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"It's a bunch of old, rusty trucks,\" said Montgomery, the Alabama lawyer. \"It's not some national security thing.\"\n\nMosieur, the importer in Portland, said it's become very hard to import Defenders into the U.S. since the Richardet investigation began. \"The difference between then and now is crazy,\" he said. \"There's way more scrutiny... I'm afraid to bring another one in now.\"\n\nMany, including Mosieur and Hedrick, wonder why Jaguar Land Rover North America has been so involved with getting the trucks off American roads (or dirt, in many cases). They've wondered why the company has provided so much support to the government in this case.\n\nMaybe these old, rusty trucks are an embarrassment to the brand, or maybe Land Rover feels they could pull buyers away from getting the new models they sell at their dealerships -- although Mosieur admits that's hard to believe since they're so very different.\n\nStuart Schorr, a spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover North America, told Jalopnik that this was assuredly not true, and said the company hasn't been involved in the case.\n\n\"We appreciate people's enthusiasm for the Defender,\" Schorr said. \"We understand the desire people have for them.\"\n\nIn the meantime, owners have little else to do besides help Hedrick with his case and fume at the government.\n\n\"This is the Department of Homeland Security run amok,\" Montgomery said. \"They need to let them go tomorrow. They need to reimburse us for the loss of our vehicles.\"\n\nAnd in spite of everything, Roediger said he doesn't really have hard feelings toward Richardet. He's angrier about the seizures than about anything else.\n\nHe also said that when his Defender was seized, the agents asked if he'd be willing to be a witness in a case against Richardet. At first he considered it, thinking it might get his truck back sooner. \"After all that has happened, there's no way I'd testify against the doctor now,\" he said. \"I don't want to help their case.\"\n\nThat's a point Hedrick has raised, too: \"I once said to (Assistant U.S. Attorney) Steve West, 'Do you really expect people to testify favorably after you've seized their vehicles?\"\n\nFor her part, Brinkley can't understand any aspect of the case, which she sees as a waste of tax dollars on an investigation of a man who may not have even broken the law. But she and the other owners just want one thing -- their Defenders back.\n\n\"They better be in damn good shape,\" Brinkley said. \"That's all I have to say.\"", "The lingering Eurozone crisis has brought with it a decline in the value of the euro vs. the U.S. dollar. With the economic situation in Europe still shaky, the European Central Bank (ECB) has initiated a strategy of quantitative easing to spur growth. At the same time, problems in Greece have not gone away, and the new Greek government is threatening to exit the euro currency. All of these things are likely to keep the euro low for some time to come, and as with most things, there will be winners and losers in the U.S. economy. (See also, Will The ECB's Quantitative Easing Sink The Euro?)\n\nImporters of European goods. Companies that use European parts as inputs will find their supply chains becoming more affordable. Transportation companies that purchase European cars and trucks will benefit by adding to their fleet at a reduced cost. Similarly, airlines that buy their planes from Airbus or other European aircraft manufacturers will do so at better-than-usual prices. This can help boost profit margins for these firms.\n\nU.S. consumers. American consumers will find that imported consumables, such as fine wines and cheeses from France and Italy, have become more affordable. German cars, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Volkswagen, will all become less expensive at showrooms in the U.S.\n\nInvestors in European companies that do big business in the U.S. American investors are able to buy shares of foreign companies through ADRs which are listed on U.S. stock exchanges. European ADRs of companies that have a large presence in the U.S. may benefit by increasing sales here. Bayer, the German producer of over-the-counter drugs, reports that a 1% depreciation of the euro could increase company sales by \u20ac260 million. Airbus could see a $1 billion boost in profits for every 0.10 decline in the euro, and chemical manufacturer BASF forecasts an extra \u20ac50 million in earnings for every one cent the euro drops.\n\nTourists and travelers to Europe. When the euro is weak, it means the dollar must be strong relatively speaking. Tourists and business travelers will see their dollar go farther while abroad. U.S. companies who regularly send employees to Europe for business will also benefit from cheaper accommodations. Ex-pats who live in European cities but earn dollars will also see their cost of living go down.\n\nExporters to Europe. U.S. companies that export to Europe will lose out as their products become more expensive for European buyers. Companies such as beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), tobacco companies like Philip Morris (PM), fast food chains including McDonalds (MCD), and consumer electronics and appliance producers like Harman International (HAR) all rely on sales to European customers as a large portion of their annual revenues. These companies may see their profitability suffer as a result. Investors in domestic companies that have large exposure to the European market should be wary.\n\nThe U.S. tourism industry. Tourism may suffer as American destinations become more expensive for European citizens. While it is true that the industry has reported fewer European travelers visiting the U.S. each year for the past few years, tourists from other parts of the world such as Asia and South America have reduced the negative impact of fewer Europeans. Ex-pats from Europe living in America but earning euros will see their cost of living increase.\n\nThe weakening of the euro against the dollar has created both winners and losers in America, and there is potential that the euro value may continue to slide. While importers and consumers of European goods will benefit, U.S. exporters to Europe will lose out. U.S. travelers to Europe will find that their dollar goes further, but Europeans may avoid traveling to America as their euros will buy less. Domestic companies that do a large amount of business in Europe will experience lower profitability for their investors, while European companies that do big business in America may see rising share prices.", "For three years, Nissan has hosted a web series, GT Academy, whose intent is to find legitimate, IRL talent from a pool of virtual, video-game-playing racers.

It was given to the city of Greer by Greenville Hospital System in September of 2010 after GHS opened its Greer Memorial Hospital campus on South Buncombe Road in 2008.\n\nIt's been vacant since.\n\nAt its next meetings in coming weeks council is expected to weigh options and formulate a plan moving forward.\n\nThe city attempted a sale of the campus, once valued at $6 million, for $1.4 million in December 2010 to Cardinal Real Estate Group, Inc., a firm run by Union native Garrick Good. Plans were announced for a $14.2 million senior housing project and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national call center that were to create about 150 jobs, but the developer failed to secure necessary funding, and Cardinal Real Estate eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nA judgment for restitution was handed down last year, at which point the city had spent about $149,000 on maintaining and marketing the site, according to David Seifert, the city's director of finance.\n\nA diesel fuel spill from an emergency power generator in December 2010 reached a nearby creek but has been mitigated and poses no threat, according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nKimley-Horn's analysis, detailed in a 50-page report, examined the property, the market and key potential uses that would best benefit the city.\n\n\"They did a great job of first analyzing the overall market conditions in our community, looking at things like demographics and economic drivers, and then looking at what the forecast might be for three very specific areas: hospitality, retail and office opportunities, including the kind of demand that we forecast over the course of the next several years,\" said Deaton. \"It would appear that the greatest opportunity for the property lies in full demolition, although there is some opportunity for partial demolition, keeping a part of the existing building available for office development.\"\n\nThe prominent location on a well-traveled road near downtown Greer - which is buoyed economically by the nearby Inland Port, Greenville-Spartanburg Airport, BMW and a large Bass Pro Shops retail outlet to open next year - give the property key value, city leaders say. Any company or entity working to adapt to the buildings already on site will be limited by their designs, slope of the property and limited direct access to Wade Hampton Boulevard.\n\nThe analysis' recommended next steps include preparing thorough site plans covering full and partial demolitions; securing separate estimates for demolitions; and having the property appraised based on potential redevelopment.\n\n\"That building and property has always had value,\" Greer Mayor Rick Danner said when the judgment on the property's failed sale was handed down. \"The value to (Greenville Hospital System) was such that they were gracious enough to offer it to us for our own use. Basically there were no restrictions on it other than no uses similar to what they were trying to do (at Greer Memorial). It was a good-faith effort on their part that was appreciated by the city. In hindsight, cities aren't typically in the real estate business.

That is roughly the same size as Apple Inc, the most valuable company in the Standard and Poor's 500 index, is worth now.\n\nInvestors were quick to point out that reaching that goal would require a jump of 2,700 percent in the value of Tesla's shares, given its market value of $26.6 billion.\n\nActually, at its current annual production rate of 55,000 cars a year, the company would have to sell every car until 2040 to get to that market cap.\n\nMore likely, Musk expects the production rate to expand, but the question is by how much? Today, every Tesla car represents $463,636 in market cap. Assuming that ratio remains unchanged, it would take sales of 1.45 million cars every year to justify a $700 billion figure and the same investor faith in future growth.\n\nBy Musk's 2025 target date, everyone who currently bought a Tesla would have to convince 26 of his best friends and relatives to buy one as well.\n\nToyota Motor Corp, by comparison, sold 10.2 million cars worldwide last year. Each vehicle sold represented approximately $21,681 in market value for the $221.1 billion company.\n\nMichael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Boston-based Fiduciary Trust Co, said that the company's rich valuation is the main reason he doesn't own shares.\n\n\"It probably is the next generation of cars, but it is ridiculous when you consider what you're paying for as far as future growth prospects,\" he said.\n\nTesla faces stiff competition from high-end car makers such as BMW and Audi, who will eventually roll out their own electric cars that are comparable to Tesla's, he said. Apple, by comparison, has an easier path with selling $200 iPhones.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nShares of the company, which did not post a profit last quarter, fell 5.6 percent in midday trading Thursday, and are down 23 percent over the last six months. (additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica; editing by Linda Stern and David Gregorio)", "This year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2015) brought us a number of exciting new concepts, designs, and prototypes to look forward to, both in the near and distant future. Some of these, such as the self-driving car, are not likely to be available to us for some years to come. However, there were some newly unveiled concepts that should give all of us cause to be excited for the near future.\n\nOne innovation has been followed by a great deal more unexpected buzz than perhaps any other. It is a new design for car headlights, presented by BMW. The new lights utilise \"smart lasers\" and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) technology, which they claim will revolutionize the way that we see while driving at night. And if they become the norm, there are a few ways in which these M4 Concept Iconic Lights will do just that.\n\nFirst of all, rather than using regular incandescent lights that are installed in most vehicles, the organic light used in both head and tail lights, as well as indicators, means that rather than one single bulb, there is basically a strip of light on both the front and the back of the vehicle. This allows for a more focused and sharply defined light, and means that it is possible to have much greater control over the brightness of both front and rear lights at any given time.\n\nFurthermore, the nature of these lights means that they are significantly safer than the standard alternative. Controlled by automatic sensors, they are not only able to adjust to your driving speed and environment, but they will also lessen the chance of blinding other drivers in oncoming traffic.\n\nThe implications of these lights are subsequently far-reaching. They not only make for a more convenient driving experience, but they will help to eliminate the thousands of accidents that take place on North American roads each year as a result of bright headlights. Over 170,000 accidents occur in Canada every year.\n\nBut one of the most interesting things about this innovation, is the fact that no one has thought of it before. We have had the technology to make this sort of headlight for some years now, and anyone who has driven a car would be aware of the limitations that come with any standard vehicle headlight. While many car manufacturers have looked into headlight automation, none have taken it quite as far as BMW now have.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, there is a lot that we can learn from this. BMW focused on a previously overlooked feature of a standard automobile. Something that, on the surface, didn't necessarily need improving. By doing so, they have taken their product to a whole new level, and created a perfect marketing opportunity. Rather than following the \"if it ain't broke\" philosophy, they have taken a step back and said \"how can we make it better?\"", "MILAN Feb 12 (Reuters) - Italy's Pirelli, the world's fifth-largest tyremaker, on Thursday forecast an 11 percent rise in 2015 operating profit after last year's earnings met expectations as strong sales of premium tyres offset weakness in Latin America.\n\nPirelli, which makes tyres for motorcycles, cars and Formula 1 racing cars, expects to grow revenues by up to 6.5 percent to around 6.4 billion euros ($7.30 billion) this year.\n\nIt forecast earnings before interest and tax, after restructuring costs, of around 930 million euros, while investments are seen at below 400 million euros.\n\nThe company has managed to boost margins in the past few years even though car sales in Europe fell to historic lows. It has done this by focusing since 2010 on more upmarket tyres for brands such as Mercedes, Audi, and BMW - luxury carmakers which have weathered the downturn better than their mainstream rivals.\n\nPirelli said 2014 operating profit rose 6.8 percent to 838 million euros helped by its focus on higher-margin products, a better price mix and efficiency measures.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a 837 million euro operating profit, according to a consensus provided by the company.\n\nRevenues stood at 6.02 billion euros, down from 6.06 billion the previous year and compared with an analyst consensus of 6.05 billion euros.\n\nThe Italian group's results compare with weaker results from France's Michelin, which pledged to step up cost-cutting efforts after cut-price competition hit profits more than expected last year.\n\nPirelli's results were released after the Milan stock market closed on Thursday.

Now the Wall Street Journal is chiming in with its own report that claims Tim Cook approved Apple's project over a year ago.\n\nApple reportedly has several hundred employees working on the secret project that's aiming to create an Apple-branded electric vehicle that can take on Telsa.\n\nSpeculation of the Apple car project ramped up last week when mysterious Apple vans were spotted in Brooklyn, San Francisco and Hawaii. The electric car project is supposedly code-named \"Titan\" and the initial design looks like some sort of mini-van, according to WSJ's sources.\n\nTim Cook has allegedly tapped VP Steve Zadesky to lead the project and has given him permission to create a 1,000-person team and to poach employees from different parts of Apple. It's also interesting to note that the project started around the time Elon Musk confirmed Apple and Tesla had been in talks.\n\nWhile Apple doesn't have any experience manufacturing cars, employees on the project have visited contract manufacturers in recent months that could build a car on Apple's behalf. The WSJ specifically names Magna Steyr as one suitor which has already made cars for BMW and Mercedes in the past.\n\nJust because Apple has a team building an electric car doesn't necessarily means the company plans to launch one any year soon. Phil Schiller once admitted that Apple looked into building a car before it looked into smartphones, however there's big difference between making iPhones and pumping out mini-vans.", "A project to test driverless vehicles that launched Wednesday in the U.K. has brought focus on safety, insurance and regulatory issues. The U.K. project will conduct trials of driverless shuttle cars in London's Greenwich borough and in Bristol. The government will study public reaction and related legal and insurance aspects. John Vincent Cable, the British secretary of state for business, has said he expects driverless vehicles to become a \u00a3900 billion ($1.4 trillion) industry over the next decade.\n\nDriverless vehicles will certainly become reality, but not any day soon, said Wharton management professor John Paul MacDuffie. \"The auto industry is over 100 years old,\"he said. \"[The introduction of driverless vehicles] is probably the biggest set of changes since the 1920s.\"\n\nMacDuffie discussed the technology on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.) \"[Driverless technology] is at that exciting moment where everybody is filled with all the visions of the future\u2009Twitter ,\" he noted.\n\nRapid Progress\n\nAccording to MacDuffie, the technology for driverless vehicles has shown rapid progress worldwide. \"The technology [is] racing ahead of everything else, including agreement to use the technologies, how to regulate them and how to insure them in this case,\" he said, adding that there will likely be a long wait before the technology moves from \"driver-assist\" features to one where drivers can take their hands off their vehicle steering wheels.\n\nMeanwhile, the British example \"shows it can happen now,\"he said. He cited Google's extensive trials with driverless vehicles. \"They have vehicles that can drive completely hands off,\"he said. He also referenced Google's recent announcement that its efforts will focus on settings for low-speed and controlled-access, much like in the British trials. \"A lot of the complicated issues about the use of this technology go away when you get to very low speeds, and you don't have as many distractions for the vehicle to deal with.\"\n\nBeyond Cruise Control\n\nMeanwhile, driver-assist technologies have advanced rapidly, said MacDuffie. He noted that driver-assist features such as cruise control have been around for many years. \"We've got vehicles already that have lane-drift alert,\"he said. \"Before long, it will be common to have lane control -- a little bit like cruise control -- where the car will keep you in the lane, and not just warn you when you are drifting.\"\n\n\"[Driverless technology] is at that exciting moment where everybody is filled with all the visions of the future.\" -John Paul MacDuffie\n\nOf late, automakers have introduced newer options such as one that allows a car to parallel park automatically. \"You get into the right position, push a button, take your hands off and it does the steering, the braking, the positioning and everything else,\"MacDuffie said of that feature. He credited the newer driver-assist features to advances in sensor technologies and the ability to process sensor data.\n\nMacDuffie said there are two parallel developments that would further make way for driverless cars. One would be automakers steadily including more and more driver-assist features in their vehicles -- initially as options, but regulators may mandatorily require some of them, he said. For example, rear-view cameras are currently optional but will be mandatory in the U.S. after May 2018. The second development would be the introduction of low-speed, controlled-access features, MacDuffie noted.\n\nChanges on the Way\n\nMacDuffie referred to a recent study from the University of Michigan that considered whether a household may not need two cars if one vehicle drops somebody off at work and returns so that others in the household can use it for errands all day, and then goes back to pick up the first person at the end of the workday. However, he did not expect driverless vehicles to get rid of the demand for personal vehicles. \"The universal human desire is for autonomy and freedom, and it is very strong as you emerge from adolescence -- and cars are going to represent that and continue to,\" MacDuffie said.\n\nBut MacDuffie described several scenarios where driverless technology could come into play. On the one hand, \"You are out, you are free, [and] you are not too curtailed by congestion or something [else],\"he said. \"If self-driving is a feature, you can turn [it] off so when you want to drive, you can drive and have fun.\"The second scenario is where the driver is in a traffic jam and hates it. \"[Here], you are in a traffic jam you can check your email or take a nap.\"The third is when someone else is driving, such as a cabbie. \"If somebody is driving you around, one of the options is a driverless version of that,\"he said. \"Then, it's not necessarily all bad from the point of view of losing that freedom experience of the car.\"\n\n\"The technology [is] racing ahead of everything else, including agreement to use the technologies, how to regulate them and how to insure them.\" -John Paul MacDuffie\n\nDriverless technology could be handy in other settings, too, MacDuffie added. For example, a city administration could use driverless cars in congested areas, setting aside separate lanes where it operates as a public service. Another possibility is for driverless vans to pick up people with mobility challenges. \"Reports I have read suggest that this could be a huge quality-of-life changer [for them],\"he said, pointing out the often long and frustrating waits they have to endure before being picked up.\n\nAddressing Security and Safety\n\nConcerns raised by driverless technology include security issues, especially hacking, said MacDuffie. Here, the information technology industry could incorporate in cars all the security features it has mastered in the world of computing, he said. He cited how German automaker BMW is now adopting a new standard for automotive Ethernet, which would help replace the hundreds of pounds of cabling that today's cars have. Drawing upon recent conversations with Silicon Valley technologists, MacDuffie said driverless vehicles would also have different connectivity needs depending on the type of use -- open connections for entertainment and Wi-Fi, for example, but also fire-walled connections for vehicle controls.\n\nMacDuffie also expects separate regulation for driverless cars. \"Cars are heavy, fast-moving objects that kill people if they are not controlled.\"", "Chevrolet announced yesterday at the Chicago Auto Show that the company has greenlit the production of the Bolt, its new electric vehicle (EV). The car was first shown to the world at last month's North American International Auto Show in Detroit, MI as a concept, but according to Alan Batey, president of GM North America, the response from the public has convinced the company to build the car.\n\nAlthough details are still scarce, the Bolt will sell for around $30,000, and GM promises a range of 200 miles on a charge. The car will be built at GM's Orion Assembly, located near Detroit. Boosting the car's green credentials are the fact that the plant is powered by gas from two nearby landfills and a 350 kW solar array.\n\nGM\n\nThe Bolt looks like a cross between the Volt and BMW's i3.\n\nGM\n\nThe Bolt looks like a cross between the Volt and BMW's i3.\n\nGM\n\nFrom the side, it's a pretty conventional two-box shape.\n\nGM\n\nThis interior looks great -- let's hope it makes it to production.\n\nThe Bolt will be a direct rival to Tesla's future affordable EV, the Model 3, and it may indeed beat the as-yet unseen Tesla to market.

Bolts should start appearing in showrooms in 2017. Here's hoping they drive well.", "The vendors made last-minute adjustments and tweaks. Manufacturer representatives looked over promotional materials and gave each vehicle a quick visual inspection. Besides a few media types, the show floor was empty -- a metaphorical calm before the storm.\n\nMalcolm Hogan and I stood at Buick's display with product communications specialist Katie Bjork. She had flown in from Detroit the night before and was as equally fascinated by Jacksonville as Malcolm and I were by learning about the 2016 Buick Cascada.\n\nWho better to roll out Buick's new European drop-top than a French Canadian fluent in four different languages living in Detroit?\n\nThe Cascada defies much of what we know about the old Buick, forging a new path while consciously reinforcing the heritage of the brand.\n\nMuch like Bjork, the Cascada draws upon European foundations and merges them with American influences. Both know the idiom of the United States, but pronounce it with a foreign accent.\n\nJacksonville is on the radar in Detroit. The Bold New City of the South represents strong sales numbers and the folks in Detroit are paying attention.\n\nBuick's new Cascada represents the first convertible from the brand in 25 years. Already available in Europe at the Opel Cascada, the drop-top oozes Bavarian style and luxury in a practical (for a convertible at least) and subdued package.\n\nPowered by a Cascada-exclusive 200-horsepower 1.6-liter turbocharged inline-four and six-speed automatic transmission, the new Buick should offer a spirited, if not completely sporting, driving experience.\n\nThe fit and finish appear to be top-notch; even details like the retracted convertible top's molded tonneau cover grabbed my attention.\n\nWhile I am hesitant to predict that the Cascada will be an immediate best-seller, I certainly see the appeal, especially for the nearly 12 months of convertible-friendly weather of the First Coast.\n\nWhile the show floor remained eerily quiet, just outside the Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center was a different story altogether. The crowds gathered with patiently restrained anticipation, forming careful lines at each of the entrances waiting for the doors to open. A minute or two before noon, show security received the green light, unceremoniously opening the 2015 Jacksonville International Auto Show.\n\nFor a car reviewer, taking in the Jacksonville International Auto Show felt akin to a family reunion. Seeing the 268-horsepower turbocharged 2015 Subaru WRX brought back fond memories of pushing the all-wheel-drive affordable sedan around corners that would make many other comparably priced cars wander into the ditch.\n\nAcross from the Subaru exhibit sat the all-new 2015 Hyundai Genesis sedan. The display car also arrived in an all-wheel-drive flavor with Hyundai's potent 3.8-liter V-6 under the hood.\n\nSitting in the seat brought me back to Greenville, S.C., where Hyundai allowed Malcolm and me to punish the affordably priced BMW fighter on the winding roads twisting through the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nEven in the crowded show, the Genesis held its own as an amazingly equipped sport luxury sedan at a very competitive price. Factor in Hyundai's Assurance plan, which the manufacturer touts as \"America's Best Warranty\" and you have a hard to beat package.\n\nAcura also provided a strong presence at the show. The all-new TLX was a nice centerpiece to a collection of strong vehicles. Acura is another manufacturer that offers a winning performance-to-value ratio. The sharp lines and ergonomic interiors of the ILX, TLX and RLX sedans and the RDX and MDX SUVs offer something for almost everyone.\n\nRecently named 2015 North American Car of the Year, the Volkswagen Golf GTI proudly greeted me as I entered the historical section of the Prime Osborn Convention Center. Much like the facility, the Golf has been around for a while and only becomes better with age.\n\nThe latest 2015 GTI boasts up to 220 horsepower and essentially defines the concept of the \"hot hatchback.\" Moreover, recognized as a segment leader for design, innovation, technology and value, the Golf is much more than simply a fun car. The compact Volkswagen could easily serve as the primary vehicle for a small family that values performance, convenience and saving a buck or two.\n\nAnother star of the show was the all-new 2016 MKX. While I haven't had the opportunity to sit behind the wheel of Lincoln's newest luxury crossover, it certainly has curb appeal. Powered by either the new twin-turbocharged 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 engine that is expected to deliver more than 330 horsepower and more than 370 pound-feet of torque or the base 300-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6, the MKX should have plenty of go and fairly decent fuel economy.\n\nWhile the Lincoln exterior styling may seem extreme and futuristic to folks unfamiliar with the brand, the bold grille is actually a sedate throwback to the show-steal boldness of the original Lincoln Zephyr produced from 1936-1940. Much like Buick, the Lincoln brand is working to combine 2015 technology with classic sensibilities and design.\n\nComplementing the latest and greatest vehicles of the show was an outdoor display from the Jacksonville Corvette Club on Saturday and the Jacksonville Mustang Club on Sunday.\n\nPart of the weekend exhibition includes a People's Choice Award, chosen by spectators. Saturday's plaque was bestowed upon Ronnie and Pam Edge's stunning Venetian Red 1957 Corvette Stingray. The first-generation 'Vette was a recent class-winner at the Hilton Head Concours d'Elegance.\n\nSunday's winner was Justin Gossell and his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback. Gossell's highly modified pony car sports a modified 302 cubic-inch V-8, five-speed transmission, sport suspension, and a custom built interior.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jeff Norris, president of the Jacksonville Mustang Club, for helping me with the details on the Mustang show winner.\n\nCelebrate Valentine's Day with cars and doughnuts\n\nWhile the Jacksonville Auto Show may not return until 2016, Saturday's Automotive Addicts Cars & Coffee offers plenty of gas-powered fun for automotive enthusiasts.\n\nWe are featuring a sublime green 707-horsepower 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat and a rare Chevy-powered 1959 Ferrari 250 GT PF Coupe along with its owner -- Randy Cook, author of \"Bowtie Ferraris.\"\n\nAnd since it's Valentine's Day, The Florida Times-Union will be providing Saturday's visitors heart-shaped treats from Krispy Kreme Doughnuts while supplies last.\n\nHope to see you at the Times-Union, located at 1 Riverside Avenue, from 8 to 11 a.m.!", "Provided by Jaguar/LandRover Set to star in the next James Bond film are these three vehicles - the Jaguar C-X75 concept (center) as well as a heavily modified Range Rover Sport SV (left) and Land Rover Defender Big Foot.\n\nIt's officially less than one month to the 20th annual Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance.

These days the car that sets the pace at the front of the pack is typically provided through consideration by a sponsor. In the MotoGP series, that's BMW and its M division, which have served up the Official Car of MotoGP since 1999. What you're looking at is the latest, and it packs some innovative technology on board.\n\nAside from the matte black wrap with BMW's iconic striped livery, upgraded aero kit, retrofitted interior and emergency equipment, this BMW M4 coupe packs a new injection system under the hood. Only instead of injecting fuel, it injects water into the combustion chamber - something that wouldn't usually be recommended, but BMW insists actually aids in the combustion process.\n\nThe idea is that the temperature of the air being mixed with the fuel inside the engine is usually hotter than ideal, so the system injects a fine mist of water into the collector in order to reduce the air's temperature... sort of like one of those hydrating misters at an amusement park or outdoor mall, but in an even hotter environment. The system brings the temperature of the air down to a more optimal temperature, helping it combust better.\n\nThe process is said to yield a number of positive effects. For one, it reduces knocking. For another, it can make more out of lower-octane fuel where higher octane isn't available. It also can control the adverse effects of higher ambient temperature on the combustion process. But most of all, it increases output and reduce fuel consumption by around eight percent.\n\nWhether that eight percent is worth the added weight of the system - particularly with water pump and a 1.3-gallon tank in the trunk - is up for debate. But we'd imagine that the Bavarian engineers have weighed very carefully. Of course there's also the matter of refilling the water tank, which BMW says would be carried out whenever the safety car is refueled, but in real-world conditions would only necessitate attention once every five top-ups at the gas station.\n\nBy now you might have guessed that BMW probably didn't develop this system just for the MotoGP safety car, and isn't planning on keeping it confined to the racetrack. Instead it's being tested and demonstrated on the safety car before being rolled out on production models in the future. Since the manufacturer says it can optimize the system for performance or for economy, we wouldn't expect it to be implemented only on performance models, either.\n\nShow full PR text BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car: More power, courtesy of innovative water injection.\n\nMunich. As it did last year, the BMW M4 Coup\u00e9 will again head the safety Car fleet in the MotoGP World Championship in 2015. BMW M Division's high-performance coup\u00e9 has been designed to ensure maximum driving dynamics and with its use on the racetracks of this world in mind. The six-cylinder inline engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology, a high-rev concept and distinct racing genes contributes significantly to the high-performance character of the overall concept. Already in its production version, the sporting heart delivers a top performance of 431 hp (317 kW) and provides a maximum torque of 550 Nm (combined fuel consumption of 8.8-8.3 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions of 204-194 g/km) over a broadly usable range of revolution speeds.\n\nTechnology transfer with potential for the future. Appearing as it does in the extremely performance-oriented world of MotoGP, where the world's top motorcycle racers battle for points and positions, the Safety Car must also boast appropriately impressive performance parameters. With this in mind, the engineers at BMW M Division have equipped the high-performance power unit with an innovative water injection, thus considerably increasing the engine's performance. Water injection makes it possible to raise the upper performance limits, which have otherwise been restricted thermally. As well as increasing performance and torque, the innovative system in the BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car also ensures outstanding efficiency with benefits in terms of full-load consumption and exhaust emissions. As a BMW M product at the cutting edge of technology and innovation, the BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car also opens up possibilities for use of this technology in future production models.\n\nSophisticated cooling system for maximum performance. placed particularly high demand on the temperature management of the engine and its auxiliaries. In order to guarantee optimal operating temperatures at all times, BMW M Division has turned to a cooling system that is as innovative as it is effective. Next to the main radiator, additional radiators also ensure balanced temperature control for the high and low temperature circuits, as well as for the gearbox and turbocharger. The exhaust air, which is heated by the turbocharger, is cooled using indirect intercooling and is supported by an additional electric water pump.\n\nThe kind of increase in performance evident in this year's BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car also places even greater demand on the thermal qualities of the turbo engine, particularly the cooling of the supercharged air. This challenge has been overcome using the innovative water injection. As well as significantly increasing performance, the high-performance power unit also boasts outstanding full-load consumption and emission figures.\n\nFollowing intense testing within the MotoGP World Championship, the water injection system will also be employed in a BMW M production model in the near future. This allows BMW M Division customers to take advantage of high-performance technology straight from the racetrack, which considerably improves performance on the streets and is ideally suited for everyday usage.\n\nWater injection: cooling efficiency increases effectiveness. The water injection system employed by BMW M Division further optimises the performance and consumption of the charged six-cylinder, inline engine at full throttle. The engineers make use of the water's physical effect during the vaporisation process to extract the energy required from the environmental medium. Water is injected into the intake module's collector as a fine spray, thus significantly cooling the exhaust air during vaporisation. This lowers the discharge temperature in the combustion changer and thus reduces the tendency for knocking. The turbo engine can thus be operated with a higher charging pressure and an earlier ignition point.\n\nThe lower process temperatures also reduce the formation of hazardous substances, in particular nitrogen oxide (NOX). Water injection consequently dramatically improves the effectiveness of the engine. The technology increases performance and torque, whilst at the same time ensuring outstanding consumption and emission figures. As such, the improved performance can be achieved without increasing the heat applied to performance-related components, meaning the reliability of these parts is not affected.\n\nThe advantages of water injection can be used in different ways, depending on the engine and vehicle design. The engineers hereby have relatively free rein to decide to what extent they wish to optimise either the performance or the consumption of the power unit.\n\nPotential for systematic usage. When a turbo engine whose turbo charger reaches its maximum speed at nominal output is fully charged, additional water injection makes it possible to increase performance and reduce consumption by about eight per cent. At the same time, losses in performance as a result of rising ambient temperatures (> 20 \u00b0C) are also compensated by increasing the amount of water being injected. And finally: instead of more performance, water injection can also be configured to reduce consumption, thus allowing more savings when fully loaded.\n\nIf water injection is taken into account when designing a high-performance engine, the turbocharger can be implemented with a suitably high degree of supercharging, whilst at the same time achieving a high compression ratio. The result is a substantial increase in performance and the reduction of consumption and emission figures when fully loaded.\n\nThe mechanism behind water injection in detail. The performance achievable by a combustion engine is limited by various factors, including the process temperature in the combustion chamber. If this temperature is exceeded, the result is uncontrolled combustion (knocking) and thus a loss in performance and, in the worst case, expensive damage to the engine. This is particularly important when the engine is charged, as the intake air is already heated intensely in the turbocharger's supercharger. An intercooler does ensure that the temperature drops as necessary, but even that has its physical limits. Depending on design and dimensions of the cooling system and the car's aerodynamics, the intake air reaches temperatures that are just below the maximum permitted temperatures.\n\nIncreasing the supercharging pressure would exceed the knocking limit and is therefore not a viable means for increasing performance. BMW M Division has a solution: injecting a fine spray of water into the collector once more significantly reduces the temperature of the combustion air. The cooler supercharged air reduces the engine's tendency to knock, making it possible to bring the point of ignition forward and thus closer to the optimum value. This makes the combustion process more effective, whilst at the same time reducing the combustion temperature. On the other hand, cool air has a higher density which increases the oxygen content in the combustion chamber. This results in a higher mean pressure during the combustion process and in turn optimises performance and torque. Finally, the effective internal cooling of the combustion chamber reduces the thermal strain on numerous performance-related components. This not only prevents damage to pistons, exhaust valves and catalytic converters, but also reduces the strain on the turbocharger, which is subjected to lower exhaust temperatures.\n\nResolving a conflict of objectives. Using water injection to increase the knocking limit also helps to largely resolve a familiar conflict in objectives when designing powerful engines. Performance and consumption are not least determined by the compression ratio. This also applies, in particular, to highly charged turbo engines like the BMW M TwinPower Turbo, inline six-cylinder. Thanks to a high compression ratio, this engine is highly efficient and boasts low consumption figures, especially in partial load range. However, the maximum compression ratio is limited by the knocking tendency when fully loaded. Water injection is also hugely beneficial here, as it reduces the tendency for the engine to knock, whilst at the same time increasing the compression ratio. This way, the turbo engine can achieve optimal performance across a wide range of operating points: the potential of the technology increases more, the lower the octane rating of the fuel used. As fuel with ROZ 98 is not available everywhere in the world, water injection helps achieve optimal performance and consumption from an engine with Super E10 (ROZ 95).\n\nImplementing the technology in the BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car. When positioning the water injection, the engineers at BMW M Division opted for a layout with three injection valves in the plenum chamber, each supplying two cylinders of the six-cylinder, inline engine. This solution ensures very equal distribution and also allows the system to be designed in a compact manner.\n\nLocated in the boot of the BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car is a water tank with a gross volume of about five litres, which houses the water pump, sensors and valves. The pump and complete system of sensors and actuating elements are controlled by the engine electronics, which have been upgraded accordingly. In practice, the pump feeds the water to the injectors at a pressure of ten bar, whereby the appropriate volume is supplied depending on load, engine speed and temperature. This ensures that water consumption is kept to an absolute minimum. In rigorous action out on the racetrack, it is always necessary to refill the water supply whenever the car must refuel. During standard operation, the intervals between water refills are considerably longer, depending on the driving style. Even when driving faster on the motorway, it is only necessary to refill the water container roughly every five stops for refuelling. To ensure the system is as suitable as possible for daily use, it does not require any additional maintenance.\n\nMaximum system safety. For safety reasons, the BMW M water injection works with a sophisticated automatic diagnosis. Should the water tank be empty or parts of the system fail, appropriate measures will be taken to protect the power unit. Supercharging pressure and ignition point are cancelled, thus enabling continued operation of the engine without any restrictions other than reduced performance. However, a wide range of measures also ensures the functionality of the system during normal operation. After the engine has been turned off, the water is transported back from the pipeline into the tank, in order to prevent the system components freezing in minus temperatures. The water tank itself is also frost-proof.\n\nTechnology transfer from the racetrack to the street. With water injection, BMW M Division is once again underlining its many years of motorsport experience and expertise when it comes to developing powerful drive trains. The letter \"M\" is not only synonymous with success on the racetrack, but also with uncompromising high-performance, street-legal sports cars. The BMW M4 MotoGP Safety Car allows BMW M Division to underline its innovative prowess and to follow the brand's philosophy of bringing motorsport technology to the streets. At the same time, the model also offers a clear perspective of an M car that will set a new benchmark in terms of performance, exclusivity and individuality. As well as greater performance coupled with outstanding consumption and emission figures, customers will also benefit from an innovative water injection system with benefits both on the racetrack and in everyday use.", "CAR manufacturers are cramming cars with wireless technology, but they've failed to adequately protect those features against the real possibility that hackers could take control of vehicles or steal personal data, according to an analysis of information that manufacturers provided to a senator.\n\nUS senator Edward Markey, Democrats-Massachusetts, asked carmakers a series of questions about the technologies and any safeguards against hackers built into their vehicles. He also asked about how the information that vehicle computers gather and often transmit wirelessly is protected. Markey posed his questions after researchers showed how hackers can get into the controls of some popular cars and SUVs, causing them suddenly to accelerate, turn, sound the horn, turn headlights off or on and modify speedometer and gas-gauge readings. The responses from 16 manufacturers \"reveal there is a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle or against those who may wish to collect and use personal driver information,\" a report by Markey's staff concludes. Today's cars and light trucks typically contain more than 50 electronic control units - effectively small computers - that are part of a network in the car. At the same time, nearly all new cars on the market today include at least some wireless entry points to these computers, such as tyre pressure monitoring systems, Bluetooth, internet access, keyless entry, remote start, navigation systems, WiFi, anti-theft systems and cellular-telematics, the report said. Only three said they still have some models without wireless entry, but those models are a small and declining share of their fleets. \"Drivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven't done their part to protect us from cyberattacks or privacy invasions,\" Markey said in a statement. Among the report's findings: - Most manufacturers said they were unaware of or unable to report on past hacking incidents. Three declined to answer the question. One described an app designed by an outside company and released for Android devices that could access a vehicle's computer network through the Bluetooth connection. A security analysis didn't indicate any ability to introduce malicious code or steal data, but the carmaker had the app removed from the Google Play store as a precautionary measure. - Each manufacturer is handling the introduction of new technology in very different ways, and for the most part these actions are insufficient to ensure security. Hackers can get around most security protections cited by manufacturers, according to the security experts Markey consulted. - Only one manufacturer appeared able to detect a hacking attempt while it was happening and only two described credible means of responding to such intrusions in real time. Information from most carmakers indicated they wouldn't know about a hacking attempt unless data from the vehicle's computers was downloaded by a dealer or at a service centre. Most new cars are also capable of collecting large amounts of data on a vehicle's driving history through an array of pre-installed technologies, including navigation systems, telematics, infotainment, emergency assistance systems and remote disabling devices that allow car dealers to track and disable vehicles whose drivers don't keep up with their payments or that are reported stolen, the report said. Half the manufacturers said they wirelessly transfer information on driving history from vehicles to another location, often using third-party companies, and most don't describe \"an effective means to secure the data,\" the report said. Manufacturers are also using personal vehicle data in various and often vague ways to \"improve the customer experience,\" the report said. Policies on how long they store drivers' information vary considerably. Customers often are not made aware explicitly of the data collection and, when they are, they frequently cannot opt out without disabling valuable features like navigation. The car industry is in the early stages of establishing a voluntary information sharing and analysis centre or other comparable program about existing or potential cyber-related threats. \"But even as we explore ways to advance this type of industrywide effort, our members already are each taking on their own aggressive efforts to ensure that we are advancing safety,\" the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in a statement. The Society of Automotive Engineers also has established a security committee that is evaluating the vulnerability of cars to hacking and is drafting \"standards and best practices to help ensure electronic control system safety,\" the alliance said. The Association of Global Automakers, another trade association, said the responses provided to Markey are many months old and don't reflect extensive discussions between the industry and US technology experts aimed at improving the industry's understanding of cyber threats. The manufacturers who replied to Markey are BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Porsche, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen-Audi and Volvo. Three other carmakers - Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Tesla - didn't reply to his request for information.", "A BMW i8 featuring a striking Lime Green finish is currently on display at the company's Abu Dhabi dealership.\n\nAt a first glance we thought this was one of those expensive paintjobs from BMW's Individual customization program but upon closer inspection we noticed that this is most likely a wrap.

BMW is now considering boosting production in order to meet the unexpected very high demand.", "Banned because of morality or taste, forbidden to talk about, a vehement prohibition based on social custom, anyway you want to define it, a taboo isn't just a word with great spiritual basis. Additionally, taboo isn't just one of those ultra rare words in the English language that doesn't have Greek, Latin or French roots. It's way more than that when cars are also an important part of the bigger picture.\n\nThank you Captain Cook and thank you South Pacific Islands for giving us this word, but this editorial isn't about etymology. This is autoevolution and all things auto are our bread and butter. The subject of this piece is a rather simple one in essence, although it isn't too easy to understand why breaking automotive taboos is for the greater good of everybody in question.\n\nBy everybody I'm referring to a given carmaker, the automotive industry itself and us consumers. In a nutshell, what I'm trying to explain with this piece is that automakers sometimes make the right choice by going against the trend and their hardcore fan bases. Without further beating around the bush, I shall now start by talking about the Porsche marque.\n\nDo you remember how much booing and hissing was thrown around by the media and Porsche-loving public back in 2002 with the introduction of the Cayenne? The first SUV built by the brand that gave us the iconic 911 was awaited with mixed anticipation and many people were not exactly impressed by the Type 955 Cayenne's humble skeleton.\n\nReskinning a VW Touareg inside and out then stick some Porsche badges isn't right at all, but you know what? It was the best thing Porsche could've done at the moment. I won't dwell into technical details such as the heavily modified PL71 platform or the first V8 motor employed by the Stuttgart-based manufacturer since the 928 was discontinued back in 1995. What I want to talk about is how the Cayenne saved Porsche.\n\nIf it weren't for its mass-market appeal and its affordable pricing strategy, Porsche would've gone belly up by the end of the Noughties due to the massive expenses and slow-selling models of the early 2000s. You know, selling the first-gen Boxster and 996-gen 911 wasn't enough for that era's Porsche brand, a financially burdened company that couldn't get its act together.\n\nIf you want to thank somebody or something for saving Porsche, pay your respects to the model all laughed about back in 2002. Furthermore, do not forget to thank Porsche's decision to sell its soul to the devil and introduce turbo diesel mills on the Cayenne. Europe is mad about them oil burners, be it a mere B-segment hatchback or a full-on Porsche Panamera sports luxury sedan.\n\nI fully agree that the Cayenne and turbo diesel technology are compromises, but without them, the 911 Turbo S, 918 Spyder and Cayman GT4 would've been nonexistent today. But Porsche is the tip of the automotive taboo breaking iceberg.\n\nWhat's your take on the soon-to-debut Bentley Bentayga, Maserati Levante and Lamborghini Urus? These legendary companies fare better than ever when referring to sales volumes and net income, so why is it necessary for everyone to follow Porsche's lead?\n\nA good answer is the board of directors and the shareholder's wish to make more money, but it's not only that. Remember what happened over at Maserati later last year? If you don't, let me cut to the chase - thanks to the entry-level Ghibli in both V6 twin-turbo petrol and diesel guise, the House of the Trident returned better net income than the pinnacle of FCA and the best name in the automotive business - Ferrari.\n\nMore money equals more freedom for Maserati designers and engineers, which ultimately leads to more mass-market-oriented products such as the upcoming Levante SUV. Furthermore, a little amount of that increased net income will trickle into making supercars and jaw-droppingly pretty machines such as the Maserati Alfieri. Because of this, breaking automotive taboos shouldn't be only acceptable in this day and age, but a strict requirement for brands to keep on keeping on.\n\nMoving on to US-related automotive taboos that were broken only recently, who would've thought that 2014 will see a volume manufactuer offer a sub-$60,000 vehicle with more than 700 HP on tap? That's the best case of value for money us gearheads have ever encountered. However, it wasn't easy sailing for the Dodge brand before the 2015 Challenger SRT Hellcat and Charger SRT Hellcat were presented to the world...\n\nAfter the commercial flop known as the SRT Viper rebranding, Dodge's new-found sporty brand identity was hit hard. Looking on the matter on hand from another perspective, it's ludicrous to offer a 707 HP muscle car or four-door sedan for less money than a 2015 Dodge Viper SRT, but the bet ultimately paid off and both the Hellcat siblings and the Viper are now selling like hotcakes. Who do we thank for this? Tim Kuniskis, the gentleman that heads Dodge and its SRT-badged products since April 2013.\n\nOn an ending note, does anyone among our younger readers remember what they were drawing when they were kids? Wedge-shaped supercars with machine guns were they? Well, machine guns didn't make it, but the wedge-shaped supercar lives on, albeit not as mighty as in the olden days when Weber carbs were king of the hill. Nowadays, even hypercars are described by ignorants as souped-up hybrids.\n\nIt's a bit of a shame how the Toyota Prius got to inspire McLaren, Ferrari, Porsche and Lamborghini to experiment with the petrol-electric hypercar. Still, the Countach (and Rod Stewart's leopard print pants) are no longer fashionable, while the archaic Weber carburetor-fed V12 engine is no longer a production reality due to environmentally-conscious sensibleness.\n\nHowbeit, electric motors + internal combustion = better performance than ever as proven by the P1, LaFerrari, 918 Spyder and the Asterion LPI 910-4. Such mind-bending acceleration figures and low emissions were sci-fi before the 2010s came along, with similar performance and out-and-out excitement reserved only to those few lucky ones that raced single-seaters for a living.\n\nSitrep: an apparently bad decision made by an automaker may morph into the best thing that happened to that company, so it's not worth the time and effort to put our purist petrolhead pants on and start bickerin' about what's acceptable and what isn't. The truth of the matter is that if emblematic names such as Porsche or Maserati would've have bitten the dust, their deaths would've happened only if these companies would've listened to their loyal, purist customers and wouldn't have stepped outside their comfort zone.\n\nThink of breaking automotive taboos as an all in game of blackjack between a constructor and Lady Luck.\n\nEditor's note: front-wheel drive BMWs can go to hell. That's unacceptable and I'm not even a BMW fan...", "You've heard the rumours by now: forget about waiting for Apple to revolutionise the living room by launching a magical HDTV set straight from your dreams, because it's now supposedly trying to innovate in the automobile sector.\n\nThat's right. Apple is working on a car. Several reports from the last few weeks have claimed the company is not only poaching former Tesla employees and hiring automotive experts, but it is also secretly starting up a research lab filled with hundreds of Apple employees who are diligently working on an electric car codenamed Titan.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg...\n\nIndustry analysts and critics have said they think Apple is working on a car, and just earlier this month, an Apple-leased van was spotted traveling around with a strange apparatus on its roof, suggesting Apple might also tackle autonomous technology. Keep reading to find out what else could be happening in Cupertino.\n\nIt looks that way.\n\nAn unnamed Apple employee told Business Insider that Apple is working on something that will \"give Tesla a run for its money.\" It's a vehicle development-related project, and Tesla employees are allegedly \"jumping ship\" to now work at Apple. Some critics are weary about the news though, noting Apple prefers to work on just a few things at a time.\n\nTim Cook, Apple's CEO, even admitted as much last January during a conference call: \"We have zero issue coming up with things we want to do...We must focus on the very few that deserve all our energy.\"\n\nIf Apple isn't going all out and developing an Apple Car, a circulating name for what the company might call its rumoured vehicle, than it might just be hard at work improving CarPlay, a product that brings an iOS-style interface to in-car infotainment systems. It launched just last year and is still very much in the early stages.\n\nCarPlay is meant to be built directly into many cars and might one day expand to offer Tesla-like features. With the Tesla iPhone app, for instance, you can turn on heating, as well as lock and unlock doors, flash the lights, and more.\n\nYes.\n\nApple and Tesla are trying to recruit top-level employees from each other, according to Bloomberg Business, and Tesla is winning the battle by reportedly nabbing at least 150 former Apple employees.\n\nTesla has about 6,000 employees, and the former Apple employees are now filling up several different departments at the carmaker, including engineering and law. They had no problem switching companies, it seems, because Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, reminds them of Jobs. He pays attention to detail, they purpotedly claimed, and he's a strong leader.\n\nMusk has admitted that Apple is trying to poach Tesla employees, too, though the reasons why aren't clear. Apple is offering $250,000 bonuses and 60 per cent salary increases, but it has only managed to recruit a \"few people\" so far.\n\nSupposedly.\n\nApple in recent months has recruited automotive technology and vehicle design experts, including vehicle dynamics engineers, to work at its new \"top-secret research lab\", according to The Financial Times.\n\nApple designers working under Jonathan Ive, Apple's design chief, have also met with automotive executives and creators, and at times, has tried to poach them. Keep in mind Apple hired former Mercedes-Benz R&D President and CEO Johann Jungwirth last year, and he is now listed as Director of Mac Systems Engineering at Apple.\n\nJungwirth has a history of working on connected cars and autonomous driving.\n\nIt's an automative-focused research lab.\n\nThe Financial Times has claimed a team of Apple employees are researching automotive products in a new research lab at a top-secret location near Apple's headquarters in Cupertino. The team is being led by experienced managers from Apple's iPhone unit. The lab also only sprang up last year, right after the new iPhone 6 and Apple Watch unveiled.\n\nApple's new team, which includes \"dozens\" of Apple employees, might be using the lab to develop an advanced software platform based on CarPlay, though it could also be in working on the early stages of a car that may rival Tesla.\n\nPossibly.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has weighed in on all the speculation, specifically adding that Apple has \"several hundred employees\" working on an Apple-branded electric vehicle that is currently codenamed Titan. An initial design of the vehicle even looks like a minivan, though Apple might eventually kill the car altogether.\n\nTechnologies being used in Titan, including advanced batteries and in-car electronics, would then go toward other Apple products like the iPhone and iPad. It's not unheard of for Apple to investigate technologies and potential products that it never plans to retail. In addition, an electric vehicle would still take several years to complete and pass certifications.\n\nThat said, the report noted Apple is serious about its car project, as evident by the size of its project team, and it has even flown executives to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars like the Magna Steyr. Cook apparently first approved the car project almost a year ago and told Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the project's team.\n\nZadesky used to work at Ford and once helped lead the teams that created the iPod and iPhone. He is now assembling a 1,000-person team to work on Apple Car and is reportedly poaching employees from different area of the company. The team is now working at a private location a few miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.\n\nThe team's research currently includes different types of robotics, metals, and materials, all of which are consistent with automobile manufacturing.\n\nWho knows.\n\nA mysterious van with an apparatus on its roof appeared earlier this month in Concord, California, and according to CBS affiliate KPIX 5, Apple was leasing the car. San Francisco-based blog Claycord promptly published photos of the Dodge Caravan, and it noted a similar-looking, self-driving Dodge Caravan was also spotted last autumn (see video).\n\nReports have claimed Apple's van is most likely involved in some sort of mapping project, as the apparatus on top of the vehicle looks like camera equipment found on top of typical mapping cars. Apple has been planning to improve its Maps app, so it's possible that the company is preparing to launch a feature similar to Google Street View.\n\nTechnology analyst Rob Enderle told KPIX 5 that the van's apparatus had about 12 cameras on all four corners of the vehicle and that they were angled downward. Apple Insider claimed Google's Street View cars use a similar setup, with 15 cameras for stitching together images. It therefore appears as though Apple's van is indeed a mapping car.\n\nThat said, due to the coincidences with the self-driving Dodge Caravan from last autumn, other reports have wondered if Apple is developing its own self-driving technology rather than a Street View-like feature.\n\nYes.\n\nBryan Chaffin, co-founder of The Mac Observer, has claimed he is \"certain\" Apple is working on a car, especially after talking to his sources. He claimed an Apple Car is definitely being created and will \"give Tesla a run for its money\".\n\nChaffin also said: \"I should add that when I asked one of my sources flat out to put a percentage chance on Apple working on an actual car - rather than some kind of car-related technology - I was told, '80 percent.' When coupled with everything I've learned since, I'm personally closer to 100 percent.\"\n\nApple blogger John Gruber was initially skeptical, but now he has said: \"I know a lot of people at Apple, at all levels of the company, who love watches. I also know many who love cars,\" and then he provided a link to Jonathan Ive's many cars. Gruber also pointed out that only a small market share of the car industry means huge profits.\n\nWe can only hope.\n\nAccording to Cult of Mac, Apple's Industrial Design studio houses a bunch of talented automobile designers. It's own Jonathan Ive, for instance, has long been obsessed by cars and owns quite a few himself. He even reportedly wanted to be a car designer as a teenager and considered going to a UK design school that specialised in automotives.\n\nApart from Ive, Apple employs several designers who've made concept cars, and looking at those key members of Apple's design team might reveal what Apple is cooking up: Marc Newson once created a Ford O21C concept car; Julian H\u00f6nig made an Audi RSQ concept car; and Aaron Von Minden even made a fabric-cloaked BMW concept.", "As I'm working on this article, Bayerischer Rundfunk is playing the theme from the movie, \"Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines\" - how appropriate. ...\n\nAs I'm working on this article, Bayerischer Rundfunk is playing the theme from the movie, \"Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines\" - how appropriate. Recently BMW has been teasing us with videos and animations of its M4 engine. And our affiliate, BimmerToday, is reporting that the upcoming M4 GTS could feature the S55 engine with a water injection kit, which will be used to cool the intake charge.\n\nThe use of water injection solves a problem that occurs under certain high pressure conditions on forced induction engines. When significant pressure is applied to the intake air charge, the temperature of the charge increases - the act of pressurizing the charge also heats the charge up (squeeze something and it will heat up as it compresses). Inter-cooling has been used to great advantage to mitigate this problem but when you want to increase power (by increasing boost pressure) beyond the capacity of a installable inter-cooler, you need to think about water/methanol injection.\n\nThe job of the water in the kit is to cool the intake air by absorbing heat when the water is converted from a liquid to a gas (steam). Methanol is often included in the mix for anti-freeze properties as well as methanol's inherent octane enhancement (anti-knock capabilities). And it is premature ignition (or knock ) that the water injection kit also protects against. Knock can cause havoc in an engine; it is by definition an uncontrolled burn (or a burn of the fuel that occurs without an external spark - the result of an extremely hot combustion chamber).\n\nSo, to increase boost pressure (and subsequently power) in the S55 variant installed in the M4 GTS, it appears that BMW has decided to implement a water injection sequence under very specific operating conditions. The water is injected (a fine spray where the droplets are so small that almost all of the water in the drop is on the surface of the drop), the heat of the compressed charge air is absorbed by the injected water, which then cools the charge air. And cooler air is denser than hotter air (anyone that's flown out of McCarran Airport in the middle of summer knows that hotter air is less dense).\n\nThe water injection process is a delicate balancing act between too much and too little. Too much water injected and the percentage of combustible air decreases, sapping power, too little water injected and the air density drops due to excess heat, sapping power. So BMW will tightly control this process using precise injection nozzles and software (suspect, lots of software).\n\nIs this something new? No, Oldsmobile brought out the Jetfire Turbo Rocket in 1962. It utilized a turbocharged aluminum V8 supplanted with a water/methanol injection kit. The water/methanol mixture was sold by the Oldsmobile dealers under the name, 'Turbo Rocket Fluid'. Ha! The following Olds video is worth a watch for your daily minimum recommended dose of cheese.\n\nOf course hot rodders and tuners have been using this for a long time. Wander out to any BMW message board and look for water/methanol injection threads (often beginning with the introduction of the N54) and you can spend weeks reading. Heck, I had a late '70s Mustang with the turbo 4 cylinder that was modified with a water/methanol kit - however, if I may borrow a phrase from Top Gear, it was, \"Ambitious, but Rubbish\".\n\nSo why was \"Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines\" an appropriate tune? Well, water/methanol injection was used in aircraft during World War II to increase available power on takeoff for supercharged/turbocharged engines. In fact BMW used a water/methanol injection process on the TQ variant of its successful 801 radial engine. Over 70 years ago. There is nothing new under the sun.", "Around 300,000 pounds was raised in the 48 hours prior to the debut in an exclusive offer to users of the app. Over 1,100 investors have taken part, which Crowdcube said was a record for the platform.

Fifteen minutes later Neil Midgley blew for the end of extra time and Coventry City had won the FA Cup for the first and, to date, last time.\n\nThat was in 1987, 28 years ago. It is not only Coventry City who have failed to win the FA Cup since: not a single club from the Midlands has. That could change this year. There are five among the 16 clubs left in the competition, with one guaranteed quarter-finalist, since Aston Villa play Leicester City. As West Bromwich Albion and Derby County have home ties, and Stoke City travel to Championship opposition, there could be several Midlands quarter-finalists.\n\nNone, however, is expected to win. At 14-1 Stoke are the shortest-priced, but Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and West Ham are all more fancied.\n\nHistory suggest the bookies are right. If the League Cup, never a priority for clubs, is disregarded, the Sky Blues' success is the last big trophy won by a club from a region that remains Britain's manufacturing heart and numbers around 10 million people. Even that three-handled pot, once regularly lifted by Midlands clubs, has been won only once by one of them since 2000 - and Birmingham City's 2011 success was marred by a relegation they are still to recover from.\n\nIt was not always thus. The Midlands provided six of the dozen original Football League clubs and picked up regular trophies for decades. In the 1950s Wolverhampton Wanderers were the best in the land, winning a trio of titles. In the 1970s Brian Clough inspired Derby and Nottingham Forest to the League championship, and the latter to a European double triumph that seems barely believable now.\n\nAston Villa also followed up a domestic title with Continental supremacy. There was silverware for West Bromwich Albion and, in the League Cup, most of the above plus Leicester and Stoke. As recently as 1983-84 nine of the top-flight clubs were from the Midlands.\n\nHowever, the region's clubs made up the bottom six places that season and their fortunes have gone downhill ever since. Midlands football now seems in the same terminal decline as a native car industry that was once the region's economic engine.\n\nThree of the four clubs still in the top flight are fighting relegation, with Aston Villa and Leicester in the drop zone and Albion just four points clear.\n\nNottingham Forest players parade the European Cup in 1979 Derby are prospering in the Championship, and Wolves continue to recover from their descent into League One, but Nottingham Forest have spent much of the winter in turmoil while Coventry are on the brink of dropping into the fourth division for the first time since the 1950s.\n\nAside from Stoke and Derby, the only cheer is provided by Walsall's forthcoming Wembley date in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, and the League Two promotion challenges of Burton Albion and Shrewsbury Town.\n\nAt the top end of the game, however, the Midlands has become an irrelevance. Not since 1994-95, when Stan Collymore's goal took Frank Clark's Nottingham Forest to third place, has a club from the area even finished in the top three.\n\nThe new television deal may change matters. The millions on offer make English clubs even more attractive to overseas investors, some of whom may decide to may a pitch for glory as well as earnings.\n\nOnly West Bromwich and Wolves, of the region's big clubs, are still in British control. Villa, Derby and Coventry are owned by Americans, the latter via a hedge fund, Forest by Kuwaitis, Leicester by Thais. Birmingham's Hong Kong Chinese owner is in jail.\n\nIn this respect it is the same as the car industry: all those great British marques are now in overseas hands. Mini and Rolls Royce are part of Germany's BMW group, Jaguar Land Rover is a sub-section of Tata, the Indian conglomerate, Lotus is Malaysian, Aston Martin Kuwaiti, Bentley part of Volkswagen and MG run by China.\n\nMaybe the HS2 rail project will help revive the Midlands, maybe not. Maybe, had the national stadium been built there instead of Wembley it would have raised the region's football profile - not that putting St George's Park in Derbyshire has.\n\nMaybe there is no solution. London has glamour, Manchester United and Liverpool a fabled history, Manchester City limitless wealth and a growing cachet. The Midlands has a lot of clubs whose best days appear to be behind them. Unless one of them can turn the tide of history, and storm to Wembley success in May.", "New York, NY -- (ReleaseWire) -- 02/13/2015 -- Luxury vehicle is a term used for the vehicles that provide luxury (pleasant or desirable features beyond necessity) at premium price. It can also be referred as the vehicle with features such as, higher quality equipment, better performance, more precise construction, comfort, higher design and technologically innovative with features that convey an image, brand, status or prestige for the individual in the society. Luxury vehicles provide high degree of comfort than other vehicles. Major contents of these cars are genuine leather upholstery and polished \"wood grain-look\" dashboards.\n\nBuy Full Report: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/luxury-vehicles-market.asp\n\nLuxury vehicles may be classified into different forms such as sedan, coupe, hatchback, station wagon, minivans, crossovers, sport utility vehicles and convertible body styles. . In every era of automobile history, there is a group of car models that are expensive to purchase, due to their alleged superiority of design and engineering. As these models targeted the wealthy customers these are termed as luxury cars. Automobile manufacturers provide different models that are targeted at particular socio-economic classes according to their income and standard of living in the society.\n\nCountries such as China, Japan, the U.S., Canada, India and European countries are the major markets for the luxury vehicles. Increasing disposable income is the major driver for the luxury vehicle globally. Additionally, various loan schemes launched by the automobile manufacturers and the financial institutions have made it easy for the customer to buy luxury vehicles to maintain their status in the society. This may provide growth opportunity for the luxury vehicle especially in the developing nations.\n\nRising fuel price can act as restraints for the global luxury vehicle market especially in the developing countries such as India. According to Statista (Statistics Company) average prices for crude oil increased from USD 77.38 per barrel in 2010 to USD 105.87 per barrel in 2013.\n\nLuxury vehicle manufacturers may be either stand-alone companies, such as BMW and Mercedes, or division or subsidiary of a mass market automaker (Lexus part of Toyota). Some of the major brands operating in this market are BMW, Mercedes-Benz?, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar, Audi?, Bentley?, Lamborghini?, Volvo, Ferrari, Land Rover, Lexus and Cadillac.\n\nRequest Full Toc: http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/2792\n\nKey points covered in the report:\n\n1) Report segments the market on the basis of types, application, products, technology, etc (as applicable)\n\n2) The report covers geographic segmentation\n\nNorth America\n\nEurope\n\nAsia\n\nRoW\n\n3) The report provides the market size and forecast for the different segments and geographies for the period of 2010 to 2020\n\n4) The report provides company profiles of some of the leading companies operating in the market\n\nThe report also provides porters five forces analysis of the market.\n\nVisit our blog at: http://pmrblog.com/\n\nAbout Persistence Market Research\n\nPersistence Market Research (PMR) is a U.S.-based full-service market intelligence firm specializing in syndicated research, custom research, and consulting services.

Classic prototypes were way cooler.\n\nWhen Alfa Romeo introduced the original concept of its halo car at Expo 67 in Montreal, they didn't even have a proper name for it. The show car was labeled simply as the \"Montreal Expo Prototipo 105,\" and used a 1600 cc engine from the Giulia Ti with Bertone's 2+2 body built on the chassis of the Giulia Sprint GT.\n\nThe name stuck despite the fact that Alfa never sold the Montreal in North America due to it not meeting the US emission levels, and the Italians had to do a lot of work before they could introduce it in Europe at the 1970 Geneva Motor Show with a 2.6 liter dry-sump V8, the infamous SPICA injection system and about 200 horsepower going to the rear via a limited-slip differential. They had two cars ready at the time, and full production could only start in 1971.\n\nIn the meantime, spy photographers didn't have a chance.\n\nOf course Alfa Romeo was quite creative when it came disguising their precious prototypes. Just look at this Germanized Alfasud mule doing some desert testing in the early seventies.\n\nThe BMW kidney never looked more at home than in the middle of this compact's grill!\n\nAnother four-door Alfasud variant in 1971 went as far as creating a whole new brand using Superman's favorite letter to fool all those sneaky journalists. But this was no \u0160koda. Nor Suzuki, or Studebaker, or anything out of Turin, really.\n\nWhile Italians went premium by using BMW's design, Munich returned the favor by making Paul Bracq's front for the first 5 Series look like something you could find on a cheaper British or Italian sedan, with rectangular headlights and zero kidney grills in sight. You don't need more for some high-speed testing.\n\nBut did they fail on having one too many wheel-lugs?\n\nEither way, this strange E12 wasn't BMW's finest classic mule moment. Not by a long shot, because that would be the E32's in the US of A.", "Hiya. You should drop everything you're doing and read this right now.\n\nThere have been whispers of Apple designing a car since well before the passing of Steve Jobs. But this time, the rumors appear to have some gas behind them.\n\nThe Financial Times reports today that Apple has hired a number of big names in the automotive industry to work at a top-secret research lab, including the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley R&D division. Apple has \"dozens\" of employees working on automotive-related projects at an offsite location, the paper wrote, led by several top managers from the iPhone team.\n\nIt's possible that the new lab is working on projects related to CarPlay, Apple's in-car interface for iOS devices. (Cars with CarPlay installed will begin shipping widely this year after a production delay last year.) But the FT reports that the new lab will likely have a hardware focus:\n\n[People] familiar with the company said the background of the people Apple is hiring -- including automotive designers and vehicle dynamics engineers -- and the seniority of the executives involved suggest a car could be in the works.\n\n\"Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay,\" said one person who has worked closely with Apple for many years, referring to Apple's infotainment system. \"Today I think it's a car.\"\n\nOther reports have discovered that Apple's R&D team has turned to other luxury car companies for talent as well; they've hired former BMW designer Aaron Von Minden, who worked on a shape-shifting car made of fabric, and Julian H\u00f6nig, a former designer for Ferrari and Audi.\n\nOf course, guessing at Apple's product roadmap is often a fool's errand. (Remember those years of Apple TV set rumors?) But if Apple really does have a secret car project underway, and its supply chain remains as leaky as it's been in the past, we'll likely hear about it sooner rather than later.", "LATEST: A man has died following a collision with a tree on the A39 near Perranarworthal this morning.

The total raised so far is 475,000 pounds and the biggest single investment so far is 50,000 pounds.\n\nJustPark's app connects car-park owners, often individuals with a private parking space at their home, to drivers looking for a place to park. It charges the owners of the space commission on bookings and the service is used by around 700,000 drivers spread across the English speaking world.\n\nThe app's early development was backed by BMW and Index Ventures, a venture capital firm that has backed big names like Skype and British takeaway ordering service Just-Eat.\n\n\"This isn't your average crowdfunding campaign: with backing from BMW and Index Ventures, JustPark is far more established than the typical startup using this form of fundraising,\" said Luke Lang, co-founder of Crowdcube.\n\nThe current funding round will allow BMW to sell down its stake, bought for 250,000 pounds in June 2011, while Index Ventures will be converting a loan into equity at the same price as the crowd.\n\nMoney raised will be used to support product development and engage in a more aggressive marketing campaign, said Anthony Eskinazi, JustPark's co-founder.\n\n\"We wanted to do crowdfunding,\" he said.\n\n\"We talked talking about it with Index Ventures in late 2013 and they were on board.

The minimum investment to participate is ten pounds.\n\nCrowdfunding is an increasingly popular form of financing for start-ups seeking to circumvent the traditional angel investor route and cash-in on popularity with the public. Its growth has contributed to a burgeoning alternative finance market expected to be worth 4.4 billion pounds in Britain this year, according to a report by charity Nesta and the University of Cambridge.\n\nBut crowd-style financing has fallen under increased regulatory scrutiny, with the EU markets watchdog saying in December that investors need greater protection against significant risks in the evolving sector.\n\nJustPark said that searching for parking in cities accounts for around 30 percent of urban traffic and amounts to 106 days of wasted time over the average lifespan.

The driver asked each of them to get into the car so he could give them a lift to school, but both girls turned him down and made their way to school where they told police.\n\nThe man is described as white, in his early to mid 30s.

While some may call me a bit of a hard headed when it comes to changes, the recently introduced BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and the just released BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer do make me somewhat happy.\n\nWhile the purists are screaming murder, there are others that see the potential in BMW minivans.\n\nWhile the whole idea of a BMW minivan makes more than a few BMW enthusiasts cringe, the potential sales and the premium design of a high-class soccer mom automobile make could change some opinions down the road.\n\nSo I decided to look at some of the reasons why the new BMW 2 Series Gran Tourer and the previously launched Active Tourer could find place in a lot of European homes in the future.\n\nPurists generally don't have an objection to the design of the Active Tourer, or the Gran Tourer for that matter. Many understand that there are only so many ways one can design a minivan and in all fairness, BMW design team has done a good job with their first vans.\n\nThe boxy vans feature the typical design cues, starting with the A-pillar and short bonnet, and ending with the D-pillar and upright rear-end. The two front-wheel drive minivans retain though the typical BMW design elements: kidney grille, L-shaped rear lights and double round headlamps.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the first requirements for a minivan is ...drum roll...utility. That's right, utility makes or breaks a minivan, and the more features package in and outside the car, the better for sales. In all fairness though, the BMW X5 offers similar interior cabin space and gadgetry, but at a much higher price. The lack of a true seven-seater SUV also gives the Gran Tourer and Active Tourer room in the BMW lineup.\n\nWith the 2 Series Gran Tourer, there is no real need to buy an X5, if space and utility are the main purchasing criteria. And those that want xDrive, well, BMW offers the intelligent all-wheel drive system in the minivans as well. The xDrive option makes it even more attractive for younger families in the Northern parts of the world as well.\n\nThis builds atop the two previous points and somewhat brings the conclusion home. Truth is that BMW needed a minivan, and a fairly affordable one, to stay competitive in the premium segment. Both Audi and Mercedes are pumping lots of R&D money in future products, niche or mainstream, so BMW needs a new area to grow into. The front-wheel drive, with its cost advantage and new packaging, can offer that.\n\nThere are still plenty of customers out there that are not looking for an SUV, nor for a sedan, so previously they would have to turn to another automaker to fulfill their needs. No more. Now BMW offers an option for almost everyone and we can already see the BMW minivans becoming as popular as tourings in Europe.\n\nBMW can also get a younger demographic in their cars, one that loves the roundel but previously didn't have the budget for it. So a new generation of bimmer fans will be born.", "LONDON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - JustPark, a London-based start-up that launched the world's first in-car parking app, is nearly half way to achieving a 1 million pound ($1.5 million) equity fundraising target just 12 hours after its debut on crowdfunding platform Crowdcube.\n\nAround 300,000 pounds was raised in the 48 hours prior to the debut in an exclusive offer to users of the app. Over 1,100 investors have taken part, which Crowdcube said was a record for the platform.

($1 = 0.6497 pounds) (Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.", "You wouldn't like to be in our office every time we have a new test car around to review for your reading/documentation purposes. After driving it, each member of our team leaves with a different opinion on it and the contradictory discussions seem to never end. Heck, some will even go as far as to stop talking to some of their colleagues for a while, that's how serious they take matters.\n\nTherefore, when I came up with the idea of creating a list of cars that every so-called 'petrolhead' should drive before departing the world of the living, the discussions were more than fierce. However, in the end, we managed to write down five of them that might not suit everyone's taste but were regarded as the best compromises in the given situation. So, without further ado, here's our list, in a completely random order.\n\n1992 Dodge Viper\n\nBuilt back in the early 1990s, this beast was more than the world could handle back then. It was an absolute beast that had the best the industry had to offer back in the late 1980s and early 1990s in its corner before it even reached the streets in production guise.\n\nThe legend says that the legendary Bob Lutz insisted that Chrysler should create a modern equivalent of the Cobra and that's basically how the Viper came to life (notice the snake names?). Later on, as the car was getting closer to production even Caroll Shelby got involved, driving a pre-production version at the Indianapolis 500 race, raising the public's interest in it even higher.\n\nThe original was developed with the help of Lamborghini that was owned by Chrysler back then. They put together the 8-liter V10 engine and cast its aluminum block and heads. This beating heart was heavy at 323 kg (711 lbs) by today's standards but used to make around 400 BHP and 630 Nm (465 lb-ft) of torque which was monstrous back then.\n\nThanks to it, the Viper was capable of doing 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and the 1/4 mile run was handled in 12.9 seconds with a trap speed of 113.8 mph (183 km/h). Fitted with a manual 6-speed gearbox and no driving aids as we have today, you must drive one of these before saying a definite goodbye to your loved ones. That configuration might also be your doom if you're not careful enough.\n\n1961 Jaguar E-Type\n\nDubbed as the most beautiful car in the world plenty of times, the grace and stile of the Jag are hard to beat even today. Released back in the 1960s the car basically wrote history and paved the way for another car that is receiving incredible reviews these days, the F-Type.\n\nWhat we like the most about the E-Type is the statement it makes when you see one down the road. You know that the man behind its wheel knows its cars and that he's willing to pay for an icon. And the Jag has a hefty price too.\n\nDepending on the year and state, it can easily go over $100,000 but that's nothing if you're a collector, as this thing is bound to go up in value over the next years.\n\nIf back in the day the car also used to be revered for its driving dynamics, it would fail to reach to the same heights today. But that's not what draws you to it.\n\nThe long bonnet hiding an inline 6-cylinder engine, the curves of the body and the exclusivity are the traits that are simply irresistible. Be it in a 2-door coupe, 2+2 coupe or roadster guise, it will work for us. Just make sure you get behind the wheel of one before it's too late.\n\nPagani Zonda F\n\nIt was 1999 when Horacio Pagani first showed the world the Pagani Zonda and everyone stopped for a moment. We knew what a supercar was until then but this car seemingly demanded a new title, one that went beyond 'super'. That's basically how the 'hypercar' niche came to life.\n\nThe original Zonda had a 6-liter V12 developed by Mercedes in it and relied on 394 HP and a 5-speed manual gearbox to get around. It was called the C12 and would do 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.2 seconds. It looks rather dull today, right? Especially since an electric car can do the same sprint one second faster...\n\nWell, that was 16 years ago and it was nearly unheard of. However, we wouldn't count the C12 in our bucket-list top. We're talking about a different Zonda, the F version and no, the letter doesn't stand for what you're thinking of.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why we'd pick this one of out the bunch. Horacio did create a bunch of special models and we could've gone for one of those but instead we think that the car that basically provided the basis for all of them is the one to drive.\n\nOnly 25 Zonda F's were ever made and they all have a 7.3-liter V12 from AMG onboard making 602 HP and 560 lb-ft (760 Nm) of torque. The mill is atmospheric so there's no such thing as turbo lag or a sudden accumulation of twist. The delivery is silky smooth and at just over 1.2 tons it's a rocket. That's probably why they are driven only by experienced pilots and the owners prefer to keep them locked up. Yeah, that might as well become your casket if you're not careful...\n\nBMW E30 M3\n\nYou've heard at least one passionate gearhead say that the E30 M3 is an epitome of handling and a car that should be taught in engineering schools to everyone ever wanting to work for a serious car maker, right? Well, there are so many people like this out there that there has to be some truth to it, right?\n\nPrices for the original M3 are going through the roof at the moment so that's yet another clue, huh? The truth of the matter is, the planets in the automotive field lined-up when the M3 showed up.\n\nBack in the 1980s BMW was involved in a couple of motorsport championships and the touring car of choice was the E12 M635i that was good but rather heavy and showed it on the track. The CEO of the time wanted a smaller, lighter car for touring championships and that's how the E30 M3.\n\nLuck or faith made it so that at that time, engineers that worked on the 3.0CSL and the M1 were still with BMW and thanks to them and the motorsport experience the company gathered under its belt since the 1960s made sure that this would be a name you wouldn't forget.\n\nThe M3, in various iterations, is to this day the most successful car in Touring car championships with countless wins and titles to its name. The E30 is the one that started it all and has a balance and feedback in stock guise close to what pilots used in the DTM back in the day. That's what makes it magical and that's what turned it into an icon over the years.\n\nA Formula 1 car\n\nThis time we're being less specific. Driving a Formula 1 car has to be the epitome of any gearhead, no matter who he is. Various people in the business tried to do it but most of them ended up making fools of themselves and we mean famous drivers not just anyone.\n\nA Formula 1 car has to sit at the top of any list like the one we put together today as it would encompass the latest technology in the field at any given moment.\n\nWhy would a Formula 1 car be the ultimate challenge when the Zonda F is included here, right? Well, as incredible as the Pagani creation might look like, it's peanuts compared to a 1-seater.\n\nThe cars themselves are technological marvels, some having over 80,000 components in total. Due to that huge number, if one would be assembled 99.9 percent correctly, it would have around 80 parts misplaced. Yeah, wrap your head around that.\n\nAnd that's just one amazing fact about F1 racers. But the car is only part of the story. To drive one, you'd have to be physically fit and we don't mean just to be able to squeeze into the car but actually handle the forces thrown at you.\n\nWhen braking, for example, a driver will experience up to and over 5g of loading on his body and up to 4g whe cornering. That's about 4 or 5 times more than what an ordinary car could possibly pull. To better put things in perspective, think about the fact that a space shuttle acceleration tips at around 3.5g while fighter jets (yes, the ones that actually fly) top out around 8g.\n\nThat means you'd be feeling 5 times your body weight. Could your lungs, liver and kidneys handle that? Neither could anyone else's, but F1 drivers actually go through extremely intensive trainings to make sure they can withstand all of the above, just like fighter pilots.\n\nThe Red Bull team, for example, once claimed that their team drivers are trained by keeping their pulse at around 200 BPM for 2 hours. That's twice as much as is usually recommended for any human being for a short period of time. I'm sure that once you get inside one of those cars, your heart will be beating pretty hard too.", "Google's self-driving car is not expected to hit the road until around 2030. The prototype has no steering-wheel or pedals\n\nWhen it comes to driverless cars, the world's biggest automakers have decided to hedge their bets. But Google is shooting for the moon.\n\nThe internet company, whose 2010 demonstration of driverless technology ignited wider interest in the car industry, is adamant about its all-or-nothing bet.\n\n\"It sounds quaint, I guess, but my team's mission is to improve people's lives by transforming mobility,\" said Chris Urmson, head of the self-driving cars project at Google.\n\nThe stark contrast between Silicon Valley and the wider car industry has become clear in recent weeks as carmakers showed off their latest autonomous driving experiments.\n\nThese have included a self-parking BMW that responded to the touch of a smartwatch, Audi's first long-distance trial of automated highway driving and Daimler's ambitious self-driving \"cocoon\" concept.\n\nThe demonstrations were part of what the traditional manufacturers hope will be a steady progression as technology encroaches increasingly into areas that are now under the full control of human drivers, much as autopilot systems have in aircraft.\n\nThat kind of incremental improvement, however, is not in Google's DNA.\n\n\"We're not going to get there by selling a feature that a Continental or a Bosch or a Delphi is going to have a year later, that's not really what we're interested in,\" says Mr Urmson.\n\nGoogle is not alone. Uber, the ambitious ride-hailing company in which it is an investor, is the latest to join the race to develop robot vehicles. It announced its own research labs last month alongside Carnegie Mellon University earlier this month.\n\nThe two approaches highlight a different appetite for risk, as well as differing commercial needs. Google has deep pockets to invest in future projects, whereas carmakers prefer to capitalise on the premium they get from selling vehicles with the latest advances in autonomous technology.\n\nBut there are also differences over where the technology is headed.\n\nFull robot cars are \"a very appealing paradigm -- the question is how regulators would feel about cars driving themselves\", said Ragunathan Rajkumar, a CMU professor specialising in the field. He called Google's plan \"a laudable goal\" and the \"holy grail of the domain we are working towards\". But he also predicted that it was at least five years away from practical deployment, making the driver-assisted technology being pursued by the carmakers a necessary stepping stone in the meantime.\n\nAccording to Google, however, that may be a mistake. Mr Urmson, a former faculty member at CMU's robotics institute, applauded the technology being developed by the carmakers, but was also politely dismissive of their limited ambition and questioned whether they would ever be able to move from driver-assisted to full robot cars.\n\n\"There's a lot of really cool stuff, no doubt,\" he said, listing Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Ford and General Motors as companies that have made headway. But he also called it \"flawed\" to see driver-assisted technology as a necessary point on the path to what Google has in mind: a fully autonomous car.\n\n\"The idea that it's just a continuum, it's not clear that it's going to play out that way,\" he said. \"There actually is a discrete step when responsibility shifts from the driver to the\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009self-driving system.\"\n\nGoogle's gamble that it can make the leap straight to full autonomous vehicles comes as Wall Street has become increasingly wary of the company's expensive long-term bets. In a sign that it was starting to pay heed to investors' concerns, a company executive last month said that a rethink of Glass, the company's controversial smart-glasses project, showed that Google is prepared to draw in its horns when teams cannot hit their targets.\n\nMr Urmson will not discuss how much Google is spending on driverless cars or what internal milestones he has set. But he is bullish about the company's chances of reaching its goal.\n\nOne yardstick is economic. The costs of the sensors embedded in the vehicle have fallen steadily, he said, including for the laser-controlled sensors that sit on top of the vehicles and initially cost $75,000 each. \"We're in no doubt, mounting a $75,000 laser on the roof isn't the path to production,\" he says.\n\nAsked if the costs are close to where they need to be to make the car commercially viable, he gives an unequivocal \"Yes\", adding: \"We're not using titanium in anything so we don't see a problem in getting to a point where cost is manageable.\"\n\nProf Rajkumar estimated that, within three years, Google would be able to bring the cost of its technology down to $10,000-$15,000 per vehicle -- a level that might bring it into the mainstream.\n\nWhether Google can turn its bold experiment into a commercial success will also depend heavily on finding a business model that suits both the cost structure and intended use for the vehicle.\n\nIt will also need allies in the auto industry to build it. But despite holding discussions with the likes of Toyota, Volkswagen and GM, those allies have yet to be brought on board. The established carmakers are seen by some as reluctant to engage with the company they fear could eat their lunch.\n\nMr Urmson suggested that the possible routes to market range from simply selling technology to carmakers to renting out rides in a fleet of vehicles operated by Google. \"You could imagine us supplying interesting technology to the [carmakers] -- we have some things today that are fairly unique,\" he said. \"You could imagine us operating a ride-sharing service, you could imagine a lot of things.\"\n\nMore cautious experts, such as Prof Rajkumar, believe it will take years to iron out all the technical glitches that need to be solved before robot cars can be safely let loose on public roads.\n\nSuch glitches were evident as one of Google's self-driving Lexus vehicles edged slowly past the company's X labs building last month. A loud alarm suddenly sounded inside the vehicle and it lurched to the right before coming to a sudden stop.\n\nThe abrupt lunge left the humans in the front seat, there to monitor the technology, nonplussed. As Google presses ahead with visionary long-term bets, its investors will be hoping that such mishaps represent nothing more than teething troubles.\n\nSpinning 'lidar' builds digital picture of surroundings\n\nGoogle is so confident about its driverless cars because of the advances it has made in the underlying technology since it launched the project six years ago.\n\nThe car works using a spinning \"lidar\", a sort of laser, that takes 1.5m readings a second and builds up a picture of the area around the car. Further information from sensors in the wheel hub and the interior, along with a radar in the grille, are fed into the on-board processor. This allows the software to choose a safe speed and trajectory for the vehicle.\n\nThe car has made visible progress in recent years. For example, it is no longer limited to straightforward highway driving.\n\nOn a recent drive in the company's home town of Mountain View, California, the technology showed signs of being able to cope with difficult situations even in close traffic. The self-driving Lexus asserted itself, barging past a white pickup truck that failed to pull into a gap left by the Google car to avoid roadworks.\n\n\"The vehicles are getting a much deeper semantic understanding,\" said Mr Urmson, referring to the machine learning Google uses to help the algorithms that underpin it gradually take on human behaviour.\n\n\"It's estimating the intent of other drivers on the road and predicting their behaviours and being able to react to that.\"\n\nThe cars can distinguish lorries from school buses and recognise that a \"stop\" sign held up by a workman is different to a sign advertising all-you-can-eat food.\n\nGoogle, unlike the rest of the car industry, is uninterested in self-parking technology -- driverless cars, it believes, will simply drive on and pick up someone else.\n\nBut ironically, the car seemed to have most difficulty with the car park at the Google campus, twice shaking itself out of autonomous mode and calling for the \"driver\" to take over.", "Volkswagen is investing $10,000,000 of its own money to develop EV infrastructure for its electric and plug in cars. That includes its recent agreement with BMW and ChargePoint to provide a network of DC fast chargers along both coasts. But it says federal, state and local governments should be doing more to help.\n\nJ\u00f6rg Sommer, VW's vice president for product marketing and strategy in America told the 2015 Electric Drive Congress in Washington D.C. on February 10, that Volkswagen believes continued legislative support is needed to reach the next level of electric vehicle adoption.\n\n\"Automakers have effectively delivered electric vehicles that can satisfy the needs of most American drivers,\" said Sommer. \"In addition to the investment we and other companies and industries are making, we would like to see Federal financing support for establishing fast charging networks in urban areas and interstate corridors. We'd like to see more state and federal organizations commit to cleaner fleets by purchasing EVs and PHEVs. This should be a U.S. Government priority, and federal purchasing guidelines should reflect that by giving fleet purchasers the flexibility they need,\" Sommer said. \"We need further congressional support with the mid-term review of the EPA's greenhouse gas regulation to extend the multiplier credits for plug-in vehicles beyond MY21''.\n\nSommers' comments raise the thorny political question of who should pay for the buildout of EV charger infrastructure. Tesla has taken on the entire burden of creating its SuperCharger network without government aid, and it's been pretty much universally celebrated for being both fast AND free. As far as anyone knows, every manufacturer is losing money on the electric cars it builds. No one can expect the car makers to go on subsidizing the infrastructure push forever. You can't buy apples for 50 cents a piece if you can only sell them three for a dollar and expect to make up the difference in volume.\n\nWhat is the proper role of government in all this? Let us know what you think in the comments section.", "BURNABY, BC - The scene: a dimly-lit garage and a door opening slowly, revealing details as the light filters in. Rectangular headlights. A no-nonsense, bluff grille. A large rear badge that simply reads, \"Turbo.\"\n\n\"It's a car that can blow a V8 right off the road,\" says the voiceover, \"The Turbo, by Volvo.\"\n\n\"I remembered that commercial,\" says Dave Matthews, owner of an all-black 1983 Volvo 240 Turbo that's essentially the twin to the one featured in the ad. His machine is rust free and pristine, a labour-of-love restoration with a quarter-million miles on the clock.\n\nTurbocharged Volvos\n\nBrendan McAleer, Volvo\n\nIt's part of an odd gathering here on this dull day, a mix of old and new - both cars and owners. Rain's in the forecast, but there's a spot of sky-blue here too, a bright, robin's egg hued 2015 Polestar V60. Under its hood is a 345hp turbocharged straight-six; it's a surprise to find that kind of power in a Volvo, but not to those who know the brand well.\n\nVolvo started developing turbodiesel engines quite early with their commercial truck division, but didn't transfer the tech to their gasoline-powered passenger cars until much later. Canadians wouldn't see a turbo'd Volvo 240 until 1983, one built in Halifax.\n\nUS customers had already been given a taste of forced-induction goodness from 1981, and by 1983 were being offered one of the rarest Volvos ever built. 500 242 coupes were built for racing homologation purposes and shipped to the states, 30 of them being plucked for racing duties back in Europe.\n\nTurbocharged Volvos\n\nSupplied, Volvo\n\nThe Group A \"flat-hoods\" would certainly have put paid to nearly any factory-tuned Mustang or Camaro, as they were cranking out around 345hp from a turbocharged 2.1L four-cylinder. Add in a tuned suspension and bigger brakes, and you've got a Viking wearing pleated khakis.\n\nHowever, it was all smoked-herring and mirrors. A few of the Group A cars were shown to FIA officials, and then most converted back to standard Turbo trim with around 160hp.\n\nIt would be up to the enthusiast community to provide better than factory power - and they would. Some of the owners here today are Volvo fans that started out with Amazons and 144s in the 1960s and 1970s, but others hail from the internet; to be specific, they're from a local section of Turbobricks.com, a site that caters to those who feel like tire-smokin' turbo power just makes sense in a Volvo.\n\nTurbocharged Volvos\n\nBrendan McAleer, Volvo\n\nTake Zach Nicholson's lowered 1989 240 wagon: it's got doubled IPD swaybars up front, a limited-slip differential out back, and a turbocharger swap carried over from a 740. An auto mechanics student at BCIT, this car used to belong to Zach's parents. \"I used to sit in the back seat,\" he says, and now he runs it in autocross with the local BMW club.\n\nAnother member is AJ Pau, who has brought along his 1995 940 wagon. It's got a 200,000 high-mileage badge of honour on the grille, and is running about 12psi of boost under the hood. Parked nearby is Jesse Hadfield's 740SE sedan, which is running even more boost, with a plans for a T-5 Borg-warner swap in the future.\n\n\"With Turbobricks members,\" Pau jokes, \"There's a bit of an attitude of 'Hey y'all, watch this!'\"\n\nIt's a motto that Volvo's advertising department certainly would have approved of. They were forever parking turbocharged 740 and 940 wagons next to supercars; one of the best ads showed a Lamborghini Countach towing a trailer with the tagline, \"The basic idea behind the Volvo Turbo Wagon.\"\n\nTurbocharged Volvos\n\nSupplied, Volvo\n\nHowever, all hoonery aside, there's another type of Volvo owner here. The GLT and Turbo 240s weren't just factory-tuned Swedish hot-rods, they were intended to be luxurious rivals to contemporary Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.\n\nTo that end, it wasn't all boosted-into-the-stratosphere meatballs, but rather low-end usable torque. Gary Young's red 1994 940 has been well cared for, and as a result has nearly a half-million miles on the original engine and turbo. \"It's been back and forth to Palm Springs more than a few times,\" he says. Any plans to replace it? \"Well, collector's plates aren't that far off.\"\n\nYoung is one of the members of the Volvo Club of British Columbia that's shown up to today's impromptu meeting. With a 400-strong roster, the VCBC is quite active, and runs the gamut from newer turbocharged cars to older examples like the 122 wagon that club president Gregg Morris has shown up in. Bill Malkin has one of the earliest Volvo turbos here, a 2-door 1981 GLT.\n\nTurbocharged Volvos\n\nBrendan McAleer, Volvo\n\nVCBC member Bob Burns is here, but hasn't brought his 1995 T-5R along as it doesn't see rain. A rare beast, the T-5R is a single-year model developed with input from Porsche, no slouch in the turbocharging department. Making 243hp, the T-5R did wonders for Volvo's image as a performance brand operating outside the norm.\n\nVolvo would further boost this image by entering a turbocharged 850 wagon in the British Touring Car Championships. Eventually rendered uncompetitive thanks to rule changes favouring sedans, the sight of a Volvo station wagon bouncing over curbs and mixing it up with BMW M3s captured the imagination of any gearhead that had to strap a booster seat in the back seat.\n\nA decade ago, Volvo put a tongue-in-cheek sticker on the back of one of their machines during testing, showing a rampant moose on a yellow shield. It is, of course, a send-up of Ferrari's stallion emblem, and is a popular inside-joke with Volvo fans.\n\nTurbocharged Volvos\n\nBrendan McAleer, Volvo\n\nThere's more than one such sticker on the cars here today, and you could certainly slap one on the Polestar V60, based on the attention it's getting from fans of boosted Swedish iron. Polestar is Volvo's racing team and now in-house tuner and this this bright-blue wagon is fitted with everything from \u00d6hlins dampers to all-wheel-drive. It's the current ultimate fast Volvo.\n\nThe future of the brand depends on the performance of the twin-charged 2.0L four-cylinder in the upcoming XC90 crossover - which looks promising - and there was even a triple-turbo 450hp prototype engine concept last year. They might not build them like bricks any more, but the Swedes are clearly still big fans of big boost. So is every Volvo owner here today.\n\nStirring up the Polestar's big six as I exit the parking lot, and hearing the spinning turbine gulp down the air, how could you not love a boosted Volvo? Full speed ahead - maximum bork!", "The Disruptive Discoveries Journal is a free weekly newsletter focused uncovering and interpreting both the opportunities and challenges in the natural resources, agriculture, biotech, and technology sectors resulting from the belief mentioned above.\n\nTesla Motors (TSLA:NASDAQ) released Q4 and 2014 full year earnings last night and the results were disappointing. The company missed expectations on just about every conceivable metric one would use to judge success including earnings, deliveries, and revenues. Although disappointing, TSLA should still likely be viewed through a longer-term lens than its competitors as the company is still arguably in its early growth phase and isn't yet a mature operating entity.\n\nWhile the numbers we all tend to focus on were down, what was perhaps more notable were the statements made by Mr. Musk and his team on the call. They include:\n\n\u00b7 Mr. Musks' statement that within ten years TSLA could have a market cap that equaled that of Apple Inc. (AAPL:NASDAQ). AAPL's current market cap of US $740 billion would give TSLA a share price of approximately $5,920 per share based on TSLA's current share count. When was the last time you heard of a company selling what is effectively a commodity (cars) with that sort of valuation and share price?\n\n\u00b7 The company plans to spend a \"staggering\" amount going forward on capital expenditure and actually forecast spending $1.5 billion in cap ex in 2015 - roughly 50% higher than analysts had estimated. With $1.9 billion in cash on the balance sheet, how will this cap ex be financed? What is the dilution strategy? That level of detail was not addressed.\n\n\u00b7 Musk stated he has a \"secret weapon\" to ignite demand if it flags in 2015. After listening to past conference calls with the company, I understood the company to not have any issues with demand. All issues were supply-related. Has something changed?\n\n\u00b7 Finally, the company expects to be cash flow positive AFTER cap ex in 2015. This was a surprise, as in 2014 TSLA generated negative $1 billion in free cash flow and spent just under $1 billion on cap ex last year. Again, this is set to rise by 50% in 2015, so it is imperative that the company hit its 2015 sales target for Model S and X cars of 55,000. For those unaware, free cash flow is calculated by taking cash flow from operations and subtracting cap ex. Many people believe that free cash flow does a better job of demonstrating a company's ability to generate cash relative to gauging this through earnings.\n\nOther concerns include foreign exchange movements (the USD is up 7% versus the EUR in 2015), competition (BMW and Mercedes are but two of an increasing number of competitors), the sales strategy in China, and the general inability to test drive TSLA's cars (would you buy a thoroughbred horse without thoroughly vetting it first?).\n\nGiven the concerns above, I think it's important to remember that all early stage companies run into growing pains. TSLA's product is unique and I would agree when people say there's nothing like it out there. The financials of any company are of utmost importance, but in TSLA's case it's more important to see the trends in spending, revenues, cash flows, etc rather than the absolute numbers. TSLA's cars aren't (yet) commodities, and low gas prices won't hurt them, though this could come into play later in 2017 when the mass market Gen III model is forecast to be released. The real key in thinking about TSLA is separating the high flying share price from the potential of the actual business.\n\nHowever, I still believe that TSLA hasn't yet faced its biggest challenge - specifically securing enough raw materials to satisfy future growth targets. TSLA's audacious plans are well known, but adding growth plans of other major automotive and battery manufacturers together puts forth the possibility of challenges in procuring a reliable source of raw materials. To be clear, I'm not forecasting shortages, but this thinking is why I'm optimistic on the prospects for lithium and cobalt over the next few years. I actually expect to see recycling become more prevalent here.\n\nThis issue was briefly (and unsatisfactorily) addressed on the call with management saying they are \"pleased\" with battery supply chain discovery but weren't prepared to make any commitments on supply chain announcements. You're planning on doubling the global capacity of lithium ion batteries by 2020 and you're \"pleased\" with what you've found out? More detail is necessary here. One would assume 2015 will be the year we learn more about solutions to this issue.\n\nVehicle electrification is here to stay and it is an exciting time to be involved in the space. Just how relevant TSLA remains in this increasingly competitive field is anyone's guess. They offer the best product at the highest price - a fact that their financials obscure somewhat. The stock was arguably overdue for a re-rating and how TSLA achieves its goals this year and going forward will determine the company's stature in the automotive sector in the future. Until then, I await answers to some of the questions posed above.", "CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBMW and General Electric are expanding existing plants, while Toray Industries and Kobelco have announced entirely new plants to make carbon fiber and excavators.\n\nFedEx, Belk and Rite Aid have recently opened, expanded or announced distribution centers, and Michelin is mulling one.\n\nThere's plenty of industrial activity along South Carolina's Interstate 85 corridor already.\n\nAnd more is on the way, if the market for industrial property is any indicator.\n\nAt least six developers - five of them from out of state -- are spending millions of dollars to build or renovate large industrial buildings without first having in hand signed leases for the space.\n\nLongtime real estate brokers say it's as big a wave of privately financed speculative development as they've ever seen in the Upstate.\n\nTime will tell, of course, whether the developers' bets in Greenville and Spartanburg counties are well placed.\n\nMaybe, when all is said and done, they don't find the tenants they're hoping to find.\n\nBut if they do, nearly 1.3 million square feet of factory or warehouse space gets put to use.\n\nAnd that could mean lots of new jobs.\n\n\"This is going to be a litmus test, once all this is delivered, to see how strong our market really is,\" said Campbell Lewis, a CBRE broker helping a Philadelphia developer market the former American Fast Print complex in Spartanburg.\n\nThat project is a renovation, but the other six are all new buildings ranging in size from 110,000 square feet to 306,000 square feet.\n\nNone of the space has been leased, according to the developers or their brokers.\n\nJosh Jones, director of South Atlantic industrial properties for Spartanburg-based Johnson Development Associates, said he's never seen so many different developers interested in speculative buildings in the Upstate.\n\n\"It's an active, healthy industrial market again,\" Jones said.\n\nHis company may add to the speculative development.\n\nJones said Johnson Development has designed a 272,000-square-foot speculative building that it might build near I-85 and Business 85 in Spartanburg County but wants to study the market further before making a final decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson Development has begun building a 900,000-square-foot building to house the Rite Aid distribution center in the same industrial park.\n\nMarket drivers\n\nCompanies that market industrial real estate say they expect industrial development to remain strong in the Upstate this year for various reasons.\n\nThe manufacturing sector continues to be robust across the country, they note, and companies continue to restructure their supply chains in search of more-efficient ways of getting goods to market and to accommodate e-commerce.\n\nIndustrial real estate brokers also say the network of manufacturers that provides parts to the BMW plant in Greer continues to grow in line with the automaker's burgeoning production.\n\nThey also say Greenville/Spartanburg's inventory of industrial properties - the largest in South Carolina with about 158 million square feet of space - has needed modernizing for some time.\n\nBrian Young, managing broker in the Greenville office of Cushman & Wakefield/Thalhimer, gave credit to a \"strong economic development governor who's been very bullish in trying to create new jobs.\"\n\nBrokers also point to the South Carolina Inland Port, a freight-handling facility that the South Carolina Ports Authority opened in Greer a little more than a year ago.\n\nThe $50 million, 47-acre Inland Port provides overnight delivery of shipping containers via rail to and from the port of Charleston more than 200 miles away.\n\nIt's located along a main line of the Norfolk Southern railroad, a stone's throw from I-85 and next to Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, where FedEx and UPS provide daily air freight service.\n\nThe Inland Port gives companies more options in moving goods, and Trey Pennington, senior vice president for industrial property in CBRE's Greenville office, said he thinks it's \"going to be a huge magnet for bringing companies here.\"\n\nSo far, however, it has served mostly to help existing businesses rather than draw new ones.\n\nThe only new development that can be directly attributed to the Inland Port is a 413,000-square-foot warehouse on GSP land next door.\n\nBMW, the Inland Port's first customer, and its logistics vendor, Syncreon, use the warehouse to store vehicle parts and components for export to emerging markets.\n\nA spokesman for Rite Aid Corp. didn't mention the Inland Port when asked why the Pennsylvania-based drug store chain picked Spartanburg for a new distribution center.\n\nThe $90 million warehouse, announced last month, will handle items for about 1,000 stores across the Southeast and employ nearly 600 people.\n\nIn deciding where to build it, Rite Aid evaluated sites along I-85 between southern North Carolina and northern Georgia and found Spartanburg to be \"an ideal location to optimize our supply chain and better serve our stores and customers,\" said Ashley Flower, a spokeswoman for the chain.\n\nSpartanburg \"has the lowest transportation costs,\" and the state of South Carolina offered an \"attractive incentive package,\" she added.\n\nJack Ellenberg, senior vice president for economic development at the Ports Authority, said the Inland Port has attracted about a dozen companies as customers, and not all of them are located in South Carolina.\n\nHe declined to identify the customers, though he noted that BMW and the Adidas warehouse in Spartanburg have publicly stated that they use the Inland Port.\n\nEllenberg said the Ports Authority didn't expect volume at the Inland Port to reach 40,000 \"rail moves\" - or moves of cargo containers on or off trains -- for several years.\n\nAs it turned out, the Inland Port processed more than 42,500 rail moves last year, Ellenberg said. He said less than half of the volume came from BMW.\n\nEllenberg, who was a state deputy secretary of commerce when Mark Sanford was governor, said most inland ports offer three modes of transportation: truck, rail and ship.\n\nThe South Carolina Inland Port also offers an air freight connection since it's just 10,000 feet from the GSP runway, he said, and that makes it stand apart from its competitors.\n\nGreenville's problem\n\nMark Farris, president of the Greenville Area Development Corp., Greenville County's economic development arm, said he thinks the developers behind three speculative industrial buildings in the county have a good chance of finding tenants.\n\nThose buildings are nearly complete, under construction or planned at the Southchase industrial park in Fountain Inn, the intersection of Interstate 185 and White Horse Road and off of Pelham Road near Scansource Inc.\n\nFarris said he'd be surprised if the buildings are still empty in 18 months.\n\n\"The demand is there,\" he said.\n\nOver the longer term, however, Farris said he's concerned about Greenville County having enough property suitable for companies to build offices, factories or warehouses, especially along I-85.\n\nMany economic development prospects want interstate frontage, he said, because of its visibility and the advantage for logistics in being close to an interstate.\n\nUnfortunately, he said, Greenville County has less interstate frontage available for economic development prospects than neighboring counties.\n\nFarris said 37 percent of companies that rejected Greenville County as a location for new operations over the past three years did so because they didn't find any sites they liked.\n\n\"I know from experience that's extraordinarily high,\" said Farris, a past president of the South Carolina Economic Developers Association who oversaw economic development in York County for nearly 30 years.\n\nGreenville County will have to be diligent in making room for \"jobs-producing property\" as part of its land-use planning, Farris said.\n\n\"You obviously can't make any more property,\" he said, and residential development doesn't generate enough property tax revenue to pay for the additional governmental services it makes necessary.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1E7wNWk", "A 24-year-old man who assaulted a police officer is featured in this week's round-up from Aylesbury Magistrates' Court.\n\nKENNY LEE MADGWICK, 24, of Stoke Road, Aylesbury. 1) On December 13 used towards a police officer threatening words/ behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence.

Indeed, BMW has chosen Geneva as the venue for the official unveiling of its premium compact seven-seat MPV, the 2 Series Gran Tourer.\n\nBut, as clever as it is, the 2 Series Gran Tourer will have a hard time being heard over the din that will no doubt be created by a host of supercar makers.\n\nFerrari will be taking the wraps off its first ever mid-engine turbocharged V8, the 488GTB. An evolution of the company's phenomenal 458 Italia, the new car turns up the style and the performance -- 661 bhp (up by 99) and a test track lap time of 1 minute, 23 seconds (2 seconds faster) -- but also cuts harmful emissions and fuel consumption figures thanks to the turbochargers.\n\nArch rival Porsche will be showing off two hardcore track-focused cars: the Cayman GT4 and its big brother, the 911 GT3 RS both of which are bound to get the company's biggest fans worked up into hysterics.\n\nBritish supercar upstart, McLaren will also be hoping to cause jaws to drop. From out of nowhere, it has announced it will be showing off an all new model, the 675LT which, if it lives up to the hype, will be stunningly fast and stunningly good-looking.\n\nHowever, in terms of sheer spectacle no one will be able to come close to Koenigsegg, the outlandish Swedish car company. It will be launching not one, but two new incredibly fast cars at the show, one of which, the Regera is being described as a megacar because calling it a hypercar would be an insult to its performance capabilities.\n\nBut as well as a potential supercar showdown, Geneva will be playing host to some super fast, super practical and super affordable new cars, too.\n\nThe hot hatchback, a car segment invented by Volkswagen with the Mark I GTi Golf nearly 40 years ago, is still very much alive and well.\n\nThis year's show will see Honda displaying the finished production version of the Civic Type R, which can purportedly hit a 167 mph top speed, and Ford attempting to set new standards in the segment with the third-generation Focus RS. It boasts a 315 bhp engine and is the first ever RS with four-wheel drive to ensure that all of that power goes to the road.\n\nBut perhaps the one to watch will be the Audi RS3, which, like the Focus, has permanent four-wheel drive but doesn't look like set dressing from the \"Fast and the Furious.\" In fact it's a lesson in hot hatchback subtlety in all but vital statistics. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 4.3 seconds, can hit a top speed of 174 mph (280 km/h) and its engine can generate 362 bhp.", "Police have closed the main road between Falmouth and Truro this lunchtime following a serious crash near Perranarworthal.\n\nA man has been described by police as sustaining \"serious injuries\" after his car left the road at Barras Moor, near to the dual carriageway section of the road, and collided with a tree.\n\nIt appears to be a BMW car involved and its side is visibly crumpled by the force of the impact.\n\nPolice and other emergency services are currently at the scene, following the crash at 11.35am.\n\nThe Truro-bound carriageway of the A39 has been closed at Perranarworthal and Treluswell and is expected to be shut for some time.

That would be charging-station provider ChargePoint. No touchy-feely peaceful environmentalists here, folks.\n\nChargePoint is taking issue with PG&E for what it says will create \"a monopoly in EV charging equipment and services\" that will restrain growth and innovation in the industry. ChargePoint pointed to Southern California Edison as a California utility that appeared to take a more collaborative approach with the private market in terms of expanding plug-in charging station availability.\n\nEarlier this week, PG&E said it would build out the infrastructure to allow the deployment of about 25,000 plug-in vehicle charging stations throughout the utility's Northern and Central California service area, with almost all of those stations planned as Level 2 and about 100 as fast-charging stations.\n\nOf course, ChargePoint isn't exactly small potatoes either. The closely-held California company has its own network of more than 20,000 chargers and says its stations have helped customers reduce their collective gas use by 6.9 million gallons. Last month, German automakers BMW and Volkswagen reached a partnership agreement with ChargePoint for 100 DC fast chargers to be deployed on the US coasts. Take a look at ChargePoint's press release about the PG&E plan below.\n\nShow full PR text ChargePoint: PG&E Proposal Bad For Ratepayers, Drivers and EV Industry\n\nCAMPBELL, CALIF.- Pasquale Romano, CEO of ChargePoint - the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) charging network - today issued the following statement in response to Pacific Gas and Electric's proposal to own and operate 25,100 new electric car charging stations by 2022:\n\n\"ChargePoint believes strongly that utilities should play an expanded role in the EV industry and the infrastructure that supports it. However, the proposal PG&E filed today creates a monopoly in EV charging equipment and services that will stifle growth and innovation in the market.\n\n\"Allowing one monopoly utility to define the EV charging hardware, network, pricing, features and everything in between, will reduce competition and innovation. Removing station owner choice will leave little incentive to innovate or provide better or more affordable services to consumers. ChargePoint has been successful because it supports flexibility for the site owner to decide what pricing and features are best for them to attract the EV driving public. Additionally, ChargePoint prides itself in providing the features required by EV drivers for a seamless driving and charging experience.\n\n\"PG&E's proposal will hamper the industry, is bad for ratepayers, bad for EV drivers and bad for California's emissions reduction goals.\"\n\nChargePoint believes utilities should play a significant role in the EV industry. The right approach as taken by Southern California Edison, allows utilities to do what they do best - install electrical infrastructure. This approach protects customer choice and encourages continued innovation in EV charging hardware, network and services.", "As rumors that Apple is making a self-driving car rev up, a peek under the hood of the company's famed Industrial Design studio reveals a crew of talented automobile designers.\n\nAn interest in futuristic cars is embedded deep within the DNA of Apple's vaunted design team. Working under Jony Ive, Apple employs designers who worked on several fantastic concept cars, including a fabric-covered BMW that shifts shape depending on speed.\n\nIve has long been obsessed by cars. (He has quite a stable.) As a teenager, Ive wanted to be a car designer. He visited a U.K. design school that specialized in automotives with a view to studying there, but he found the other students too weird. They were making \"vroom vroom\" noises as they sketched. Instead, he went to Newcastle Polytechnic (which has since been renamed Northumbria University).\n\nA look at other key members of Apple's design team, and at a super-secret research-and-development facility planned for the company's new campus, offers a few clues about how Cupertino might go about producing innovative and unconventional cars.\n\nApple's possible interest in automotive innovation comes at a time of accelerating change for the transportation industry. From electric cars and high-mileage hybrids to autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing ventures, the way we move around the planet is undergoing rapid and radical transformation.\n\nConsumer electronics companies like Apple bring expertise in software interfaces, navigation and entertainment -- as well as in building battery-powered hardware -- to the innovation party, and could be well-placed to disrupt this traditionally conservative industry.\n\nThe fact that key Apple designers possess a deep and abiding fascination with automobiles, or that the company is hiring experts away from Tesla and BMW, does not confirm that Cupertino is working on an iCar. Nor does the spotting of mysterious Apple vans decked out with cameras and sensors.\n\nPerhaps Apple's automotive dreams begin and end with CarPlay, its platform for deeply integrating iOS into the in-car ecosystem. However, there was a time when nobody thought a underdog computer company based in Cupertino would get into the mobile phone game, and we all know how that turned out.\n\nHere's a look at some of the in-house expertise Apple could bring to bear if it were, in fact, working on transforming the automotive industry with an Apple car.\n\nApple's latest celebrity hire, designer Mark Newson, crafted a concept car for Ford. Mostly a styling exercise, the Ford O21C debuted at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show in bright orange (the car's named after the Pantone color).\n\nNewson's O21C featured suicide doors and a weird trunk that slid out like a drawer. All four seats swiveled on pedestals. The single-spoke steering wheel was reminiscent of a Newson coat-hanger design, and the entire ceiling lit up with an electro-luminescent glow.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the controls were different from anything at the time; something Apple will likely bring to the table if it gets into cars. The dials looked like one of Newson's Ikepod watches, and the button layout was unusual for a 1999 car. All the controls were presented in a long row of simple push-buttons with Apple-like icons.\n\nApple's secretive Industrial Design Group (IDg), which numbers about 20 members (no outsiders know for certain), includes Julian H\u00f6nig, a former car designer with Lamborghini and Audi.\n\nA native of Austria, H\u00f6nig did post-grad work at the Art Center College of Design, a leading automotive design school in Pasadena, California.\n\nH\u00f6nig did design work for several years at Lamborghini and Audi. At Audi, he designed the exteriors of the Audi Q3 crossover, the Audi A4 Avant and the Audi A4 Limousine. H\u00f6nig joined Apple in 2010, and is named in 118 patents awarded to Apple, according to a patent database search.\n\nH\u00f6nig also designed the Audi RSQ, a concept car designed as product placement in the absolutely dreadful 2004 sci-fi film I, Robot. Although it was supposed to represent a car from 2035, H\u00f6nig had to make it look like a recognizable Audi, so the concept got compromised.\n\nAnother member of Apple's Industrial Design Group, Aaron Von Minden, worked with BMW's famous Designworks group. While there, he worked on BMW's crazy Gina concept car and many other projects, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nGina is a fabric-covered car that can shift its shape depending on driving conditions and speed. Gina stands for \"Geometry and functions In 'N' Adaptations.\" Gina's construction is bizarre, featuring an articulated aluminum skeleton covered in a stretchy, polyurethane-coated Spandex skin.\n\nUnder the fabric, tiny motors pull the skin back to change the car's shape or reveal openings. It's \"eyelids,\" for example, open to reveal the headlamps. The engine is accessed via a zipper-like opening on the hood. Here it is in action:\n\nIt's unlikely Apple would get into shape-shifting cars, but it seems like the kind of project that would catch Jony Ive's attention.\n\nApple reportedly has been trying to poach employees from Tesla Motors, but searches on LinkedIn suggest the electric car company has hired three or four times more employees from Apple than the other way around. Tesla's hires include high-profile employees like UI designer Brennan Boblett and Doug Field, who, according to a Tesla press release, \"has been Apple's VP of Product Design since 2007 and works closely with Jony Ive.\"\n\nIn Apple's case, the company seems to have hired a handful of technical recruiters from Tesla -- not engineers or automotive software experts, as some reports have suggested. If Cupertino is looking for motoring talent to create an Apple car, it seems to be in the very early stages.\n\nUsually when Apple is seriously gearing up for major new product categories -- like the upcoming Apple Watch -- it hires senior people with requisite expertise, like Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry CEOs Paul Deneve and Angela Ahrendts (fashion), Jay Blahnik (fitness) and Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine (music/entertainment).\n\nIf an innovative and futuristic Apple Car is indeed one of the products in Tim Cook's magic pipeline, where would development take place? How about inside a high-security research-and-development facility shrouded in peek-proof glass?\n\nApple plans to build a massive R&D facility at its new spaceship headquarters, Campus 2. Called Phase 2, the R&D complex is scheduled to get started after the main campus building is completed in 2016. The planned 600,000-square-foot research center will house 2,200 employees.\n\nIt includes a four-story, glass-encased office building and a similarly sized R&D facility. The R&D building will be encased in frosted glass to keep whatever goes on inside top secret. In fact, the whole complex is separated from the main building to restrict access and keep activities hidden from outside eyes, according to plans submitted to the city of Cupertino.\n\nThe complex is far larger than Apple's current R&D facilities at One Infinite Loop, although Apple might conduct research elsewhere (and in fact, likely does). Still, the planned R&D facility seems much bigger than what would be necessary for testing iPhones and iPads. There's apparently no racetrack, though.", "Top Irish rider Lee Johnston and promising rider Gareth Keys, also from Ireland, have confirmed they will be competing at Oliver's Mount meetings this season.\n\nJohnston, from County Fermanagh, has confirmed that he will be riding his new BMW Superbike and Triumph Supersport machines at the Scarborough circuit in 2015 for East Coast Construction Racing.\n\nHe was the only rider to conquer Ivan Lintin at last year's Gold Cup meeting and not only will he be returning for September's Gold Cup meeting but also the Cock o' the North meeting in July, and will also be participating at the Barry Sheene Classic meeting in June on Suzuki 1000 and Yamaha 250 machines.\n\nAs for the opening Spring National meeting he cannot at present confirm his participation at this stage due to World Endurance testing.\n\nThis is a major boast for road racing at Scarborough having top 'young guns' looking forward to racing at the Mount once again.\n\nPromising rider Keys will be racing at the Ian Watson meeting on the weekend of April 11-12, where he will be riding a Supersport Honda for B&W Racing and an ex-Ryan Farquhar Kawasaki Supertwin.\n\nLast year Keys finished ninth in the feature Gold Cup race in only his third Oliver's Mount meeting after having won the B final at the Cock o'the North meeting.", "BMW has created a very nice driving machine in their new for 2015 4 series Gran Coupe. Alas, despite being one of the \"ultimate driving machines,\" the car still leaves something to be desired as a vehicle to live with. And what's with the model designation?\n\nWhen Shakespeare wrote \"What's in a name?\" he was referring to the surnames of his star crossed lovers Juleo and Romiet, but these days - if he were alive and a car guy - he might ask the same about BMW's current model naming conventions. That's because until recently the 4 series was just a two door 3 series, but BMW split the series in two, with the 3 referring to the four door sedan version and the 4 being the two door coupe.\n\nYet the 4 series Gran Coupe is not only a four door model, it's also a hatchback, sometimes called \"five door.\" So why wouldn't it be the 3 series Gran Coupe? Beats me. What's in a name, eh?\n\nMaybe they want their model names to be as confusing as their interfaces...\n\nIf you can get past the Gran Coupe's weird model designation which, to be fair, shouldn't be that difficult despite my angst, you'll find a really nice vehicle to drive (not surprisingly, since it's a BMW) and one that's even a tad more practical than your average sedan, thanks to the big hatch and fold down rear seat that very nearly turns the car into a wagon. You don't get the high roofline of a wagon, but you can still put a surprising amount of stuff into the hatch.\n\nBMW appears to have stolen an idea from Ford here, too, in that BMW Canada's test unit came equipped with a feature by which you just have to wave your foot under the rear bumper and the hatch will open for you. This is great if you're approaching the vehicle with your arms full of stuff, though in a clear indication of Murphy's Law the thing worked every time I tried it - except for the one time I actually had my arms full of stuff. Figures, eh?\n\nBMW's sample came with the larger of the two available engines, and it's wonderful. It's a three liter turbocharged inline six cylinder power plant BMW says puts out 300/300 horsepower/torque and that's plenty to get this mid-sized hatchback moving with wild abandon - and so little turbo lag you might forget it's a turbo. The other engine is a two liter turbo four (240/255 horses/torque), and while I prefer the six, it's more than adequate.\n\nPower gets to the wheels (all wheels, in the case of BMW's sample, otherwise it's the rear wheels) via a slick, eight speed automatic transmission with a nice manual mode. A six speed manual transmission is standard equipment on this model and as good as the automatic is I wish the sample had come with the manual because BMW manuals are fantastic. Still, the auto box is a good one, and you can shift via paddles if you want a manual experience.\n\nYou can choose driving modes from ECO PRO, COMFORT, SPORT and even SPORT+, each of which sets up the power train and suspension differently depending on the task. SPORT+ may be overkill for every day driving, but it sure is fun!\n\nThe company went through a few years where their gorgeous exteriors became a tad more controversial than courted, but over the past couple of model years they've managed to recapture their old magic without making their current line look out of date. The 4 series Grand Coupe may just be the most attractive of all the BMW four doors (well, five); it's elegant yet sporty, a real looker from its signature \"kidney\" grille and Bi-Xenon headlights with LED corona rings to its frameless side windows and rear end with its high mounted stop light on the tailgate and LED light conductors and turn signals.\n\nBMW's may not be the \"ultimate driving machine\" as long as there are Porsches, Ferraris and the like, but in the market in which it plays you'd be hard pressed to find more fun behind the wheel. The Gran Coupe is no different. It's a fantastic car to drive - and if you add stuff like the M package it gets even better, thanks to stuff like an adaptive suspension. The M package (which adds $1900 to the car's base price of $55,600) also means you get a larger air intake up front, 19 inch alloy wheels, M sport brakes and variable sport steering. It also gives you such cosmetic niceties as M door sill finishers and an M leather steering wheel.\n\nBMW's sample 4 also came equipped with the $4,900 Premium Package, which adds an alarm system, universal remote control, \"comfort access,\" a rear view camera and auto dimming outside mirrors. It also gets you parking assistance front and rear, adaptive headlights, nav system and a lovely Harman/Kardon audio system that rocks well. The sample also had BMW's ConnectedDrive Services ($500), with stuff like real time traffic information, concierge services and Internet access.\n\nGood luck using all this stuff. As with the other BMW's I've driven, living with the car drove me nuts. I eschew owner's manuals, figuring that if I as a relatively experienced and tech-savvy dude can't figure a car out as it sits, then the design is a tad obtuse. BMW's personify this. I've been driving BMW's since the 2006 model year and I still have trouble with little things like storing radio station presets - you can store them into a row of buttons on the center stack or via the iDrive/LCD screen interface and I have the dickens figuring out either of them.\n\nThat, and unusual touches such as forcing you to pull the door handles twice to get out of the car and pressing the start/stop button twice to shut the car down, and it's enough to make you tear out your hair - and I don't have enough to spare!\n\nIt's a shame, because BMW sure makes fantastic cars to drive and their features are state-of-the-art - if only you could get them to work. To be fair, you'd probably get used to all this stuff over time if you owned the car, but why should you need such a learning curve? BMW needs to take a look at some competitors like Volkswagen or KIA to see how they manage to do it.\n\nStill, this 4 series Gran Coupe is probably my favorite of the BMW's I've driven over the past coupe of years (not that I've driven anywhere close to all of them), for its great exterior design and wonderful flexibility - as well, of course, as the \"ultimate driving experience.\"\n\nBMW's sample ended up with a retail price of $65,645 because it also came equipped with standalone options including a heads-up display ($1,500), $900 worth of metallic paint and a feature that displays speed limit information ($350).\n\nModel numbering and interior interface angst aside, I really enjoyed my time in the comfortable and luxurious 435i xDrive Gran Coupe. If you can figure out how to use it, it should turn out to be a fantastic driver's car.", "A 24-year-old man who assaulted a police officer is featured in this week's round-up from Aylesbury Magistrates' Court.\n\nKENNY LEE MADGWICK, 24, of Stoke Road, Aylesbury. 1) On December 13 used towards a police officer threatening words/ behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence.

The wide stance and the lack of a roof create a contrast that's rather interesting and the curves BMW gave this car should be good enough all by themselves. Not for some people though.\n\nThis particular model went in at European Auto Source to get some new parts. However, when it had arrived, it was already wearing the most important bit of them all: a trunk mounted Aeromotion carbon fiber wing. How's that for creating a head-turner?\n\nAs a matter of fact, there have been little cars that got us all so confused over the years on our website. Why would anyone need such an enormous wing on the trunk if they're going to use the ride as a daily driver?\n\nJust making sure you don't hit anything with it should be a rather gruesome prospect. Sure, it helps that there's no roof or windows to get in the way and you get to see it directly but still... What if it rains?\n\nJudging by the sheer size of the thing we reckon that it has some serious potential for adding downforce to the mix but do you really need it? Well, looking at the changes that also happened under the bonnet, it might be the case.\n\nThe M4 received a JB4 tune along with K&N high performance air filters and a new Akrapovic titanium evolution exhaust system that includes stainless steel catless downpipes. That means the power output was increased to around 500 horses and 500 lb-ft of torque. That's a serious increase but it hardly justifies the need for such a preposterous wing at the back.\n\nJust imagine how the car looks like while retracting the hardtop. Funny, right?", "We think Audi UK bosses have the hots for the new RS3 Sportback hyper hatch, because they've just announced official pricing information way before their German counterparts. Arriving in dealerships this March, the fastest car ever to sport a 2.5-liter turbo will set you set you back 50 quid under \u00a340,000.\n\nThat's lot of money to pay for something based on the same platform as a VW Golf, but you do get a lot in return. And think of it another way, at \u00a339,950, the RS3 is less than half the cost of an RS7, but offers comparable performance.\n\nSpeaking of which, we have to mention that Audi has stuck a 362bhp 2.5-liter turbo under the bonnet and coupled it wit a new Haldex-based AWD system and 7-speed twin-clutch gearbox. As a result of this, the machine is capable of 0-62mph in just 4.3 seconds, with a top speed of 155mph or 174mph if you specify to have the limiter removed. That's only 0.4 of a second slower than the RS7!\n\nBesides the obviously superior engine, the RS3 also comes with a lot of standard kit that the S3 doesn't. This includes the bucket leather seats, the 7-speed auto gearbox, 19-inch alloy wheels and an aggressive body kit. UK versions will also have standard LED headlights, which you have to pay about \u00a32,000 extra for, normally.\n\nStill, the near-\u00a340,000 pricetag puts it almost \u00a32,000 ahead of the A45 AMG, so the RS3 is a car for hot hatch fanatics who value the brand. There are also a couple of pricy options to consider here, like the magnetic ride suspension and the carbon-ceramic brakes, both of which we think will be crucial.\n\nConsidering the Golf R is \u00a310k less and not exactly hugely slower and that BMW's rear-wheel drive M235i is so good, Audi's rocket may prove a tough sell in Britain.", "In a rather interesting turn of events, Dinan Engineering founder Steve Dinan announced that he will no longer be involved at the company and will be making a move to Ganassi Racing.

While Dublin can't compete on an equal footing with London, Barcelona, Paris and Rome, Carroll insists reaching the upper end of tier two is do-able.\n\nThe three types of visitors identified with Dublin are 'social energisers', 'culturally curious' and 'great escapers'. 'Social energisers' are quirky and non-conformist. They like kitsch, pottering around craft shops and visits to places like the Powerscourt Centre and the Irish music pubs in Temple Bar.\n\nDrawn to city short breaks, and kayaking and mountain treks, they are happy to go home feeling tired. \"Dublin is not confined to what lies between the canals,\" Carroll says, \"it stretches from Dun Laoghaire to Howth.

In addition, the Airwave service is considered to be expensive and inflexible.\"\n\nInitially developed by the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI), Tetra comprises a set of standards defining a common mobile radio communications infrastructure for emergency services, utilities and other enterprises that require specialist communications capabilities, such as private/professional mobile radio or public access mobile radio.\n\nThe standard first evolved in the 1990s to help emergency response teams across Europe communicate with one another in response to major disasters.\n\nIt is based on digital, trunked radio technology and includes mobile radio, paging and wireless data features. Tetra-based hardware also comes with encryption hardwired into it and, when first developed, was able to transfer data packets much faster than existing mobile technology.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Airwave has built up a substantial business based on Tetra technology, supplying a private network, mobile radio technology and communications services to Britain's blue light services.\n\nHowever, instead of a private network - which the government deems too costly - the suppliers selected to run the ESN will be expected to enhance commercially available broadband networks with more coverage, resilience and security, using priority access for emergency services traffic.\n\n\"The Tetra technology the Airwave network uses can't offer broadband data services, which the emergency services increasingly rely on to protect the public and save lives,\" said the government.\n\nPublic sector bodies had previously expressed concern at the ability of Tetra to provide complete coverage in some areas, notably on the London Underground following the 7 July 2005 terrorist bombings.\n\nResponding to the news yesterday, Airwave's chief operating officer John Lewis said the firm was proud of the extensive work it has carried out to help Britain's emergency services fight crime and save lives.\n\nLewis reassured customers that Airwave would continue to deliver new capabilities to its network over the remaining lifetime of the current contracts.\n\n\"We can reassure our 300,000 emergency services and public safety customers around Great Britain that we remain totally committed to continuing to deliver a mission-critical communications service with many contracts in place until at least 2020,\" he said.", "US operator AT&T's entry to the Mexican telecom market could help Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil avoid preponderant agent status, according to the latter's CEO, Daniel Hajj.\n\nHajj explained during the company's 4Q results conference that the new operator could come into the market as the second biggest revenue earner - should the Nextel acquisition move forward and successfully merge with Iusacell under the AT&T brand, it would surpass Telef\u00f3nica in revenue.\n\nCombined with Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil's efforts to sell assets, AT&T's expanding market plans and the new competitive market could be an advantage for billionaire Carlos Slim's company to shed its preponderant agent status.\n\nE-mail Start a Free Trial\n\n\"If we are going to divest assets from Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, we will do so at a new market price and in a competitive landscape that is changing,\" he said. \"We are still in the process of doing that, of looking at how to reduce our market share.\"\n\nHajj added that they are \"in talks with [watchdog] IFT\" about their preponderant agent status and possible asymmetrical measures.\n\nAccording to telecoms consultancy firm The (Competitive Intelligence Unit (CIU), Nextel and Iusacell together posted revenue of 8.8bn pesos (US$600mn) in the third quarter of last year.

Tetra-based hardware also comes with encryption hardwired into it and, when first developed, was able to transfer data packets much faster than existing mobile technology.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Airwave has built up a substantial business based on Tetra technology, supplying a private network, mobile radio technology and communications services to Britain's blue light services.\n\nHowever, instead of a private network - which the government deems too costly - the suppliers selected to run the ESN will be expected to enhance commercially available broadband networks with more coverage, resilience and security, using priority access for emergency services traffic.\n\nImportantly, the Tetra network is unable to offer broadband data services, which are increasingly relied upon to protect the public and save lives.\n\nPublic sector bodies had previously expressed concern at the ability of Tetra to provide complete coverage in some areas, notably on the London Underground following the 7 July 2005 terrorist bombings.\n\nResponding to the news yesterday, Airwave's chief operating officer John Lewis said the firm was proud of the extensive work it has carried out to help Britain's emergency services fight crime and save lives.\n\nLewis reassured customers that Airwave would continue to deliver new capabilities to its network over the remaining lifetime of the current contracts.\n\n\"We can reassure our 300,000 emergency services and public safety customers around Great Britain that we remain totally committed to continuing to deliver a mission-critical communications service with many contracts in place until at least 2020,\" he said.", "Two years after CISPA, information sharing between the feds and private sector is back with an Obama executive order.\n\nAhead of a trip to Silicon Valley, President Obama today signed an executive order that's intended to facilitate information sharing about cyber threats between the federal government and private companies.\n\n\"Rapid information sharing is an essential element of effective cyber security because it ensures that U.S. companies work together to respond to threats, rather than operating alone,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe move calls on companies to share data with the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which will disperse it to relevant federal agencies and other organizations on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThe administration outlined a few steps that tech companies will be taking, including a cyber-threat sharing partnership from the Cyber Threat Alliance, a group founded last year by Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks, which now includes McAfee, Symantec, Barracuda Networks, ReversingLabs, Telef\u00f3nica, and Zscaler among its ranks.\n\nThe Entertainment Software Association, Box, and FireEye have made similar commitments, the White House said.\n\nPrivate companies and the government are often privy to security threats, but both have struggled with how to share that information in the most secure way possible, especially in a post-Snowden era.\n\nA 2013 legislative approach, known as the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), would have allowed for voluntary information sharing between private companies and the government in the event of a cyber attack.\n\nIf the government detected a cyber attack that might take down Facebook or Google, for example, they could notify those companies. At the same time, Facebook or Google could inform the feds if they noticed unusual activity on their networks that might suggest a cyber attack.\n\nBackers argued that CISPA was necessary to protect the U.S. against cyber attacks from countries like China and Iran. But opponents said that it would allow companies to easily hand over users' private information to the government thanks to a liability clause. This, the Electronic Frontier Foundation said at the time, \"essentially means CISPA would override the relevant provisions in all other laws -- including privacy laws.\"\n\nIn general, the White House agreed with EFF's characterization, and threatened to veto CISPA if it hit the president's desk. But the administration today acknowledged the need for some sort of information-sharing legislation.\n\n\"From removing barriers, to helping to improve the delivery of timely and relevant intelligence to the private sector, to advocating for needed legislation, the President is committed to improving information sharing and collaboration with the private sector,\" the White House said.\n\nEarlier this week, Facebook announced ThreatExchange, a platform that will let tech companies privately share information about bugs affecting their networks.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House today also reiterated its call for a national data breach reporting law.", "President Obama has decided to make cyber security a key issue in his last year and a half in the White House and is looking for support from the industry to share more information about cyber threats.\n\nObama, along with many of the great and good in the IT industry as well as a representative from the UK's National Crime Agency, will be attending a White House security summit later today.\n\nThe White House has stated that the President wants to get the industry to share more information about cyber attacks so that the state is in a better position to defend itself.\n\nRather than wait for that process to be voluntary Obama may well use his keynote speech to reveal further details of an Executive Order 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, that could increase the pressure on the industry to share information.\n\n\"Though the adoption of the Framework is voluntary, the Department of Homeland Security has established the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary Program as a public-private partnership to increase awareness and use of the Cybersecurity Framework. The C3 Voluntary Program will connect companies, as well as federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners, to DHS and other federal government programs and resources that will assist their efforts in managing their cyber risks. Participants will be able to share lessons learned, get assistance, and learn about free tools and resources that can help them,\" the White House stated.\n\nThere appears to be a mixed response from the IT world to more potential political involvement from politicians and law enforcement with some of the wire services making a story out of the decision by the leaders of Google, facebook and Yahoo not to attend the event in person but to defer the invitation to their security specialists.\n\nBut some are behind increased efforts to share information to help combat cyber threats with some of the members of the Palo Alto founded Cyber Threat Alliance keen to stand shoulder to shoulder with the President.\n\n\"[We] believe there should be closer collaboration across security researchers, industry, education, and government. We look forward to sharing critical data across threat vectors that can be leveraged not only for delivering Total Threat Protection for our customers but also toward benefiting the community as a whole,\" said Stephen Pao, GM Security of Barracuda.\n\n\"Telef\u00f3nica firmly believes that the collaboration against cybercrime with leading companies in the security practice will lead us to a better cyber-resilience in the digital world,\" added Pedro Pablo P\u00e9rez, cybersecurity director, Telef\u00f3nica.\n\nThe British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has pledged to work more closely with the US on cyber security, has also made his own efforts to try to improve the amount of information that it can get its hands on.\n\nLast month, Cameron said that there shouldn't be forms of communication that could not be subject to surveillance causing some uprest among civil liberty campaigners and those in the industry that took his comments to mean that a way around encryption for the government was expected.", "AN ANGRY dad says his family's quality of life and health is being threatened by plans to put a phone mast six metres from his home.\n\nPaul Markham lives in Bulkeley Avenue, Windsor, with his wife Lucy and children William, three and Alex, six. He opposed a plan last October by Telefonica UK (O2) to put a 17.5m phone mast at the junction of Bulkeley Avenue and St Leonard's Road.\n\nIt was withdrawn the day before Royal Borough councillors were due to discuss it - but Mr Markham's relief did not last long. The company has now applied to find out if it needs permission for a smaller 15m mast in the same spot.\n\nMr Markham fears for the health of his children and those in two nearby nurseries if permission is granted.\n\nHe said: \"There are multiple reports online of the health implications from the Radio Frequency Radiation that the masts emit. No long-term studies have been completed and my three-year-old son would be sleeping seven to eight metres away from the mast.\"\n\nMr Markham, who is general manager of a tour operations company, said: \"Even if there is no proof of a physical effect there is plenty of evidence that an area visibly deteriorates when a mast like this is put up through stress and worry.\n\n\"It knocks 20 to 30% off the value of a house.\"\n\nThe company already has a mast at Stag Meadow in Windsor. But a spokesman said it needed to enlarge it to accommodate two sets of equipment and could not come to an agreement with Windsor Football Club which occupies the site, forcing it to move.\n\nShe denied a claim by Mr Markham that the company did not try to negotiate with the club and wanted to move to a site that was cheaper to rent.\n\nThe company says the second proposal has been redesigned to be less visually intrusive.", "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday unveiled a devaluation of 69 percent at the opening of a new free-floating currency exchange rate system, part of President Nicolas Maduro's efforts to shore up the OPEC nation's coffers amid tumbling crude prices.\n\nThe move may help ease market concerns of a possible debt default and boost supplies of dollars to a currency-starved economy, but risks spurring inflation amid recession, product shortages and swelling supermarket lines.\n\nIt could also lead to billions of dollars in write-downs by foreign corporations with exposure to Venezuela, which include General Motors Co, Spain's Telefonica and German drugmaker Bayer.\n\nThe central bank said dollars fetched 170 bolivars on the first day of operations of the Simadi foreign exchange platform, the weakest of a three-tiered currency control system that also sells dollars at 6.3 bolivars and at 12 bolivars.\n\nThe Simadi rate is close to the black market rate of 190, which finance industry leaders described as a sign the government is willing to allow supply and demand to set prices.\n\nEconomists have for years described the currency controls as the principal cause of Venezuela's economic malaise.\n\n\"As people start to understand this platform, then the risk premium will start falling and the exchange rate will begin to (strengthen),\" said Ricardo Montilla, head of the association of brokerages.\n\nSimadi is operated by brokerages and banks, with oversight of Venezuela's central bank. It replaced a previous currency platform known as Sicad II, which sold dollars at a rate of 52.\n\nMaduro spoke live on television shortly after the release of the new exchange rate without mentioning it, instead announcing the dismantling of a coup plot.\n\nCritics slammed the devaluation as a further weakening of their spending power amid annual inflation of 64 percent and an economy that shrank nearly 3 percent last year.\n\n\"The only coup that took place today was the one that the government staged against our bolivar, the mega-devaluation!\" wrote opposition leader Henrique Capriles via Twitter.\n\nPresident Maduro's popularity ratings have tumbled to around 20 percent, driven by voter dissatisfaction over the economy and chronic product shortages ranging from milk and detergent to medicine.\n\nThe devaluation is likely to affect the earnings of global multinationals that have operations in Venezuela and for years have struggled to repatriate revenue from local operations due to currency controls created by late President Hugo Chavez.\n\nAt least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books. Firms including Kimberly-Clark Corp, Ford Motor Co and Schlumberger have already taken sizeable charges and may have to do so again.\n\nThe new currency system would in principal favor bondholders by reducing the amount Venezuela has to pay for imports and thus increase its reserve of dollars to pay off foreign debt.\n\nVenezuela's bonds have been trading at distressed levels on concerns that lower oil prices will leave the country unable to make payments of close to $10.5 billion this year.\n\nMaduro has dismissed default talk as rumor-mongering by adversaries and vows to make all payments, including the 1 billion euro Global 2015 that comes due in March.\n\nThe new exchange rate also benefits state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] because it will be able it to sell dollars at a more favorable rate, increasing its resources to cover costs.\n\nThe impact of the devaluation on state coffers, however, will depend on the percentage of dollars sold through each tier of the system.\n\nFinance Minister Rodolfo Marco, upon announcing the system on Tuesday, said that 70 percent of the economy's currency needs would be met at the preferential rate of 6.3."]}, "Google": {"2015-02-12": ["SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.", "A mobile strategy in Asia is essential, and getting the user experience right is just as important.\n\nIt had long been predicted, but 2014 was the year mobile Internet access finally overtook desktop for the first time on a global scale. Mobile marketing is hugely important wherever your business operates, but it can be absolutely vital in key Asian markets.\n\nIndia and China both reached their own mobile tipping points in 2012 and according to the ITU, the UN's agency for ICT statistics, Asia and the Pacific have the highest number of mobile broadband subscriptions, more than 750 million by 2014.\n\nResearch from the Google Consumer Barometer, meanwhile, found that Singapore (85 percent) and South Korea (80 percent) had the highest smartphone penetration rates.\n\nMany Asian markets also have significant numbers of consumers who accessed the Internet exclusively via their smartphones. Thirty-five percent of Malaysian consumers, 24 percent of Vietnamese, and 16 percent of Singaporeans only access the Internet using their phones.\n\nDespite this, it's clear that many businesses are still not optimizing their websites for mobile.\n\nJulian Persaud, managing director of Google Southeast Asia, says 88 percent of Singaporeans have experienced problems when accessing websites on their phones, \"so clearly there's a lot more work to be done. It's vital for every business to think mobile-first.\"\n\n\"This is a massive wake-up call to any business in Singapore without a mobile-optimized site or app. This is no longer a viable approach - you're effectively slamming your shop door in the face of your customers.\"\n\nWhether you're adapting your existing website to work better when accessed on a mobile device or designing a site exclusively for mobile, you should be aware that some things that work well on desktop might not be as effective on a smaller screen.\n\nOnly a third of mobile users make it past the first page of a site they visit, so it's important to place important information, calls to action, and clear navigation options as prominently as possible on the landing page.\n\nPage-loading time is another huge issue. Almost half of mobile users expect a website to load within two seconds and 40 percent are likely to abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nCutting down on large photo files and auto-loading sound and video files can help reduce loading-times, as well as making your display design easier to get right. It's worth remembering that Apple doesn't support Flash and, with the iPhone currently enjoying an upsurge in Asia, it might be best to avoid Flash altogether.\n\nSome designers still use a separate m. domain to direct mobile visitors to a just-for-mobile site, but in 2015 this is looking increasingly old-fashioned. There are still benefits, as this approach can allow you to create a desktop website that can incorporate elements that simply wouldn't work on mobile.\n\nFor most businesses, however, responsive design offers a simpler solution.\n\nResponsive websites automatically resize and adjust their display parameters so that they display correctly on a range of different devices. This can allow you to maintain a single domain for desktop and mobile, but stringent testing is important. It also means your design must be suitable for both desktop and mobile visitors in terms of navigation and content.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch is using this technique to target Asian customers, so it will be interesting to see how successful this approach becomes.\n\nThe way people navigate around a site they are visiting on mobile can differ considerably from the way they navigate around the same site on desktop.\n\nThe main input device in mobile is usually a finger, which is much less precise than a mouse cursor. Make navigation buttons clear and large enough to use. Avoid clustering small hot spots together as it can be easy to tap the wrong one and also steer clear of text links that can be even more difficult to use on a smaller screen.\n\nYou might also consider putting more information on a single page. Mobile users often don't like to scroll too far, but this can still be preferable than having to click through to different pages. If you build in an infinite scroll feature, which auto-loads more results or information as the viewer approaches the bottom of the page, it can be useful to include a static \"Return to top\" button.\n\nOne handy way for people to navigate your site is the inclusion of a \"Site search\" box. This can be particularly useful if, for example, you have a range of products that people might want to browse.\n\nAn auto-complete or suggestion feature can help cut down the amount of text that users actually have to type into the box - and getting the right translation partner to help with this can make all the difference.\n\nAgain, incorporate a \"Return\" or \"Back\" button that allows users to easily return to the landing page or to previous results.

He can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online. It plans to hew to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi - pronounced schow-mee - has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nBarra was joined Thursday by Bin Lin, Xiaomi's co-founder and president, at the company's first major press event in the United States.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Barra described the U.S. website as \"an experimental launch\" that will help the company raise awareness in the U.S., which in turn would help its profile in other countries. He said the company also is hoping to get the kind of feedback and ideas from U.S. consumers that the company gathers in China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and six other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The company plans to expand into Brazil later this year. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Lin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for about $13. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nXiaomi is just dipping its toes in the U.S. market by selling accessories for now, including headphones for about $80. Barra said it takes \"an incredible amount of work\" to bring more technologically complicated products, such as a smartphone, to a new market. He didn't say when that might happen.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying - or at least closely imitating - some designs from Apple or other companies. At the San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. They range from games and messaging features to services that let users search for a nearby doctor and make an appointment on their phone.\n\nWhen asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Lin implied that it's not a big factor for the company. But he said, \"all companies have had patent litigation.\" He said Xiaomi has filed for hundreds of patents in part to beef up its own defenses against such claims.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Lin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

That doesn't mean a U.S. launch of its phones has been ruled out, however.\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [smartphones and tablets] to market is significant,\" said Hugo Barra, the one-time Google executive who is now vice president for international markets at Xiaomi in Beijing. Barra, who was speaking to reporters in San Francisco, noted the various certifications required to sell products in each country, the need to strike deals with carriers and organize customer support.\n\n\"It's an incredible amount of work and we have to move at the right pace,\" he said. \"We're accelerating our entry by bringing simpler products.\"\n\nWhile Barra wouldn't commit to if or when Xiaomi will launch hardware, it appears to be on the company's mind. Thursday's event was held to introduce reporters to company executives and give them a chance to see Xiaomi handsets, many probably for the first time. The company also handed out samples of its MiNote 2 smartphone to some reporters and said it was keen to hear what they thought of the phone.\n\nIn China, the company has become a favorite among local users by continually seeking suggestions and improvements for its version of the Android operating system. Users vote on what features are added and every Friday at 5 p.m. local time, an update is published. This week marks the 225th weekly update.\n\nThe features include the functional, such as software detection of spam calls (a big problem in China), the useful, like shortcuts to popular items on the McDonald's China online phone ordering system, and frivolous ones such as cartoon skins for the phone's user interface.\n\nThe company also makes its own hardware. It releases a new phone roughly once a year, emphasizing quality and low price -- a formula that enabled it to beat Samsung to take the biggest share of the Chinese market in late 2014.\n\nThe company's overseas ambitions have so far been confined to Asian nations where price-conscious consumers buy phones outright rather than through carrier subsidies, and the road hasn't always been smooth.\n\nIn India, Xiaomi is embroiled in a patent dispute with Ericsson over wireless technology. On Thursday when asked if patent concerns were delaying a U.S. market entry, co-founder and President Bin Lin spoke of the number of patents it holds but didn't directly answer the question.\n\nThe company attributes a lot of its success to the support from its users, who it calls \"fans.\" Indeed, millions follow or support the company on social media and its message board buzzes with feedback and suggestions, but it remains to be seen if that formula can be translated to success in the U.S.\n\nMartyn Williams covers mobile telecoms, Silicon Valley and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

He can do other things as well on film such as elongate an actor's fingers or add a skin rash.\n\nMaking the digital shots is tedious work. But everything today -- movies, TV and commercials -- requires visual effects shots.\n\nThe Academy-award winning film \"Black Swan,\" which garnered Kalinoski a BAFTA Film Award co-nomination (the British equivalent to the Academy Awards) for best special visual effects, took 350 digital shots.\n\nKalinoski is largely self-taught, a process that took him six months while he abandoned a career as a nursing assistant, something that simply wasn't his calling.\n\n\"I was always an artist. Back when I was in high school I was always taking art classes,\" Kalinoski recalls. \"I also always had an interest in film. But the two were never married together.\"\n\nHis interest in computers was what managed to meld the two into a dream career.\n\n\"My first computer was when I was 10 years old, an Atari 400,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"I was programming and writing code when I was 11 or\n\n12 years old, and in the '80s when the computer and the art came together I found my niche and I was at the right place at the right time. It took me about six months. I was a nurse (assistant) at a hospital for 10 years, and I quit and it took six months to go through every book and every piece of software that could teach me exactly what I was getting myself into and then I went to LA.\"\n\nAt the time it was all new. There just weren't a lot of reference points from which to learn. But there were opportunities.\n\nKalinoski's work is what's known as post production and compositor work. But one shot can take up to a month to do.\n\nHe did 10 shots for Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3.\n\n\"It's tedious work,\" Kalinoski said. \"A lot of my shots were the Kraken, a lot of tentacles in Pirates 3. There are a lot of passes; you have to add light, shadow, a consistent and constant change.\"\n\nBut that's not the hardest challenge.\n\n\"The hardest thing to do is to read the director's mind, making sure you get exactly what he wants,\" Kalinoski said. \"There is a high probability of missing.\"\n\nA 20-hour day is not unusual.\n\nHis credits also include \"Snakes on a Plane,\" where unsurprisingly he added snakes. They were all computer generated.\n\nDifferent movies bring different challenges.\n\n\"'Pirates' is pre-planned out, has a lot of money put behind it,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"'Black Swan' was cheaper and wasn't really planned for a lot of visual effects. The studio liked the film, the rough cut of it, and kept adding and adding.\"\n\nIn \"The King's Speech,\" another film he worked on, they added the crowd so the king had someone to hear his speech.\n\n\"Anytime he walked out to the balcony it was CG, all green screen,\"\n\nKalinoski said.\n\nThey recently completed visual effects work on \"The Librarians,\" a popular show now airing on TNT.\n\nThe couple founded Exodus FX, a visual effects company in Wilson.\n\n\"It was born out of the simple fact that in California the dynamics of filmmaking was changing so rapidly because the incentives for other countries and other states -- not North Carolina anymore -- that the work was expanding out, that there was this mass exodus of work and people leaving California, and we decided to form this company called Exodus FX simply because all the special effects were leaving and we could do it. And the technology has caught up to the point where we could work anywhere we want as long as we have a decent broadband option,\" Kalinoski said. \"That's one of the reasons we moved to Wilson because the cost of living, cost of doing business and the Internet infrastructure they had was the best around.\"\n\nThe two scouted out places from Japan to Austin, Texas.\n\n\"In Hollywood the overhead and cost is astronomical,\" he said. \"We just did a Google search and googled for cities and municipalities that had fiber to the home.\"\n\nKalinoski has to fly to LA sometimes and visit the studios. He was there long enough to make the connections he needs.\n\n\"They know me and know my work,\" Kalinoski said. \"It's all about contacts. That's the way it works.\"\n\nKalinoski is concerned about the General Assembly's decision to abandon incentives for filmmakers in the state. It has gutted some of the areas once thriving for filmmaking.\n\n\"Productions we were depending on coming into North Carolina, now they are all gone,\" he said. \"If they would have kept it, it would have helped us expand or bring other companies here because there was a lot of work being shot in North Carolina for years, and we were looking at that when we moved to North Carolina.\n\n\"There is a ton of work in Wilmington, and the tax incentives have been there and suddenly they disappear,\" he said. \"And for us, it really doesn't hurt us too much as a visual effects company; we just find the work that's shooting wherever and provide that service. But in order for us to expand and get bigger, we were relying on some of the productions that were going to be here in North Carolina.\"\n\nHe noted the incentives worked for years.\n\n\"How many years have they had film production in Wilmington and it was only expanding, about 6,000 people had jobs,\" Kalinoski said. \"Film incentives work really well when you have television productions actually set foot in your state and stay here and keep those people working. Those incentives work. TV shows and video game companies can be very lucrative.\"\n\nNow there has been an exodus of sorts from North Carolina as those incentives dried up.\n\n\"They didn't see there was any promise of them coming back,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers are expected to revisit last year's controversial decision to dismantle the state's film incentives, leaving it a de-facto grant program.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is proposing dismantling state laws to allow the expansion of municipal broadband services such as Greenlight.\n\nIt also puts Wilson at the center of the national broadband battle as policy-making develops. Wheeler issued a statement Monday indicating support for the request made by Wilson and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nWheeler said that communities know broadband access is a key to economic development. A vote is set for Feb. 26.\n\nThe fact that Wilson is at the center of a national broadband battle isn't lost on Kalinoski, who has followed the city's efforts to expand and is supportive.\n\n\"We want to be as proactive with that as possible,\" he said. \"Comcast told us Greenlight was a joke -- they are using old copper wiring and when it rains the speed is going to drop, and I'm like, 'I'm not an idiot. I've been involved in this for years.'\"\n\nHe'll give Greenlight officials speed updates on how things are going from his pretty impressive, complex computer setup at his home.\n\n\"It takes a lot of horsepower to complete what we do,\" he said.\n\nThey have four PCs, two built by him and two purchased from Asus and Alienware.\n\nThey have two tablets for \"mouse\" control. There are three iMacs just for basic data use.\n\n\"Our software is specifically designed and made for this type of work,\" he said. \"All the equipment would take up one regular size closet, along with switchers, routers and server. It's not as bad as it was in the 1990s when I would need one entire room and 20 computers to do what we do, and it would take twice as long.\"\n\nLuring people to Wilson for the Greenlight service has been part of the plan to support the economic health of the community all along, said Will Aycock, Greenlight's general manager.\n\nAycock said Wilson's recent fight hasn't been by chance.\n\n\"We are doing what we are doing right now because we were paying attention to the conversation,\" Aycock said. \"When Wheeler came out and started talking about promoting competition and municipal entry, our ears perked up. Here is the chairman saying competition is good, and municipal entry can be a positive. That gave us reason to say we have a good story, we're succeeding, and we're bringing value to this community and we're going to participate in this conversation and tell people what we're doing.\"\n\nKalinoski has gotten to know Wilson officials including Mayor Bruce Rose.\n\n\"Brad is a great friend to us,\" Aycock said. \"Brad is a member of this community and wouldn't have been otherwise. There are a few other businesses like that now, but it was also a general goal of Greenlight to improve quality of life and infrastructure.\"\n\nKalinoski and his wife met in Huntington, West Virginia, where he grew up.\n\n\"She's a genius,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nThey've been working together for 16 years, and she has her own list of impressive film credits.\n\n\"It's all hard work,\" Kalinoski said. \"If it wasn't hard everybody would be doing it.\"\n\nHe broke into the industry through family and industry connections.\n\nHis best friend worked as an apprentice for Christopher Tucker, who did prosthetics for the Cantina sequence in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThey flew out to California to meet one of his friends in the industry. His friend did interviews and got hired to work on \"The Simpsons.\"\n\n\"After he did that for about a year, he was like, 'Dude, just do it,'\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"My wife was like, 'Screw it; just do it.' My wife and best friend pushed me into making that leap. My mom's and dad's advice was, 'Son, if it doesn't work out promise us two things: don't go into porn and don't sell drugs.'\"\n\nThe couple lived in Hollywood 16 years. They have been in Wilson about two years and bought a house.\n\n\"We think there is potential because of the broadband to bring a lot of other companies here, a lot more interest, not just films and TV, but for content creation, the Web. I think there is a big opportunity there,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nBut he worries the loss of film incentives and other tough losses such as Historic Tax Credits could thwart promising potential.\n\n\"We're happy,\" he said. \"If they'd bring back the incentives we'd be more happy.\"\n\nInformation from: The Wilson Daily Times, http://www.wilsondaily.com", "NEW YORK -- A wave of deals in the online travel industry has increasingly put some familiar names under two corporate umbrellas: Expedia and Priceline.\n\nFor now, industry executives and travel experts say, consumers won't notice much of an impact.

He can be reached at http://twitter.com/airlinewriter", "LOS ANGELES -- \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is poised to whip up big box-office numbers over the Valentine's Day weekend.\n\nThe adaptation of E.L. James' wildly popular erotic novel could make more than $60 million over the four-day holiday weekend, which also includes Presidents Day, according to people familiar with prerelease audience surveys.\n\nThat would position it to set a record for the biggest Presidents Day weekend opening - and put the film ahead of fellow box-office newcomer \"Kingsman: The Secret Service,\" which is expected to pull in $30 million to $35 million.\n\nThe Presidents Day weekend is typically a robust time for the industry as moviegoers, many with a day off from work or school Monday, flock to theaters.\n\nCurrently, romantic comedy \"Valentine's Day\" holds the record for the holiday weekend. It debuted to a solid $56.3 million in the U.S. and Canada in February 2010. The previous record holder was 2007's \"Ghost Rider,\" which collected $45.4 million.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which is being released by Universal Pictures, follows kinky billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and his demure love interest Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). Universal is projecting the film will gross a more-modest $50 million over the four-day weekend.\n\nFandango, the nation's largest movie ticket company, reported hundreds of sold-out showings for \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" beginning with the first 8 p.m. screenings on Thursday and running through the weekend.\n\nIn a state-by-state analysis of the advance sales patterns, Fandango said that presales in Southern states were significantly higher than expected.\n\nMovieTickets.com, another ticketing service, reported Wednesday that 75 percent of all tickets it sold in the preceding 24 hours were for \"Fifty Shades.\"\n\nSome theaters are making an event out of it. Cinepolis, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., is selling a \"Valentine's Loveseat Package\" to moviegoers who want to watch the film \"like a total boss.\" The package, offered on Valentine's Day, includes two tickets, a bottle of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" wine, a blanket and a dessert to share.\n\nUniversal utilized the Web to pull in fans through interactive experiences. On the movie's official website, users can visit Mr. Grey's Seattle apartment, unlocking different areas by clicking on various promotional items around the virtual abode.\n\nThere have been some marketing obstacles, however. Some have openly poked fun at the stars for lacking chemistry. After the two presented at the Golden Globes award ceremony, Twitter users pointed out their stiff, awkward interaction, some suggesting the stars hate each other off-screen.\n\nAnd some fans of the book's highly sexual nature have expressed disappointment that only about 20 minutes of the film's 100 minutes reportedly include sex scenes.\n\nRegardless, people have been buzzing over the film on social media. When the trailer was released last July, it racked up 36 million online views in its first week. Since Jan. 1, the film has averaged about 73,000 tweets a day.\n\nFor those not pining for romance, \"Kingsman\" offers up an action alternative.\n\nBased on a comic book, the film follows a street kid (Taron Egerton) after he is recruited into a secret spy organization by Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine also play in the film.\n\nFox partnered with Google to promote the film through an interactive website, \"Become a Kingsman,\" which puts users in control of a major action scene in the movie, allowing them to fight as Firth's character.\n\nAfter users click the \"become a Kingsman\" button, a message pops up that reads: \"I hear you're keen to become a Kingsman knight. My compliments on your superb taste in international intelligence agencies. To join Kingsman, first you have to prove your potential. Your life will only be put in danger half a dozen times, nothing to worry about. Right, off you go.\"\n\nThe R-rated film is likely to draw a largely male audience and attract moviegoers who want to avoid the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" fandom.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount Pictures' \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,\" which was No. 1 last weekend, should again attract families and teenagers. It could add about $30 million.\n\nWar drama \"American Sniper\" may cross the $300 million mark domestically. The Clint Eastwood film, which is nominated for six Academy Awards, has pulled in roughly $284 million in the U.S. and Canada to date.\n\n\"Jupiter Ascending\" is also likely to stay in the top five by adding a projected $10 million to $15 million.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online. It plans to hew to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi - pronounced schow-mee - has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nBarra was joined Thursday by Bin Lin, Xiaomi's co-founder and president, at the company's first major press event in the United States.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Barra described the U.S. website as \"an experimental launch\" that will help the company raise awareness in the U.S., which in turn would help its profile in other countries. He said the company also is hoping to get the kind of feedback and ideas from U.S. consumers that the company gathers in China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and six other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The company plans to expand into Brazil later this year. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Lin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for about $13. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nXiaomi is just dipping its toes in the U.S. market by selling accessories for now, including headphones for about $80. Barra said it takes \"an incredible amount of work\" to bring more technologically complicated products, such as a smartphone, to a new market. He didn't say when that might happen.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying - or at least closely imitating - some designs from Apple or other companies. At the San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. They range from games and messaging features to services that let users search for a nearby doctor and make an appointment on their phone.\n\nWhen asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Lin implied that it's not a big factor for the company. But he said, \"all companies have had patent litigation.\" He said Xiaomi has filed for hundreds of patents in part to beef up its own defenses against such claims.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Lin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

Instead, Xiaomi will sell its lesser-known ancillary products such as headphones and its Mi Band wearable fitness tracker.\n\nRelated stories CNET reviews Xiaomi's slick Mi Note Mi Note sells out in under three minutes Xiaomi, China's largest smartphone vendor\n\nAn online store signifies the first step towards its eagerly anticipated entry into the US market. While not a household name, Xiaomi has steadily built up its reputation among the tech savvy as \"the Apple of China\" with affordable and slick-designed devices packed with high-end components, all with price tags that are sometimes half that of its competitors' products. Further adding to the hype is its position as the world's most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $45 billion. But the Western markets represent a different beast -- one where consumers gravitate to the biggest names like Apple and Samsung.\n\nHugo Barra, a former Google executive who left the search company to join Xiaomi as vice president of international operations in 2013, said the company wants to be calculated and careful when bringing its flagship products to new markets. It's a now-recurring theme for the start-up that considers itself an Internet services company -- not just a handset maker.\n\n\"The amount of effort required to bring those products [phones and tablets] to market is significant.

The pace of that growth has many wondering when Xiaomi will expand to markets where Apple and Samsung have captured large percentages of the market. Xiaomi prefers to take its time.\n\nXiaomi's strategy of launching an online store echoes similar plays run by fellow Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Alcatel. While these companies supply cheaper smartphones to prepaid customers through their carrier relationships, they are attempting to push their higher end flagship smartphones directly to consumers through their own online presence.\n\nXiaomi, however, is moving even more gingerly, holding off on its marquee smartphone products for now.", "Allergan Allergan's Botox was the first product to change the face of women and even men in the last decade. Today we are seeing a whole suite of companies coming up with pharmaceutical magic potions to keep people feeling and looking young forever. The search for a magical elixir to prolong life does not seem to be all that \"magical\" and impossible with our current technology. A host of companies from Novartis Novartis to Google Google are on a mission to conquer aging.\n\nImagine living 10 years more than your expected lifespan, feeling a few decades younger than your actual age, and having the mental and physical agility of someone half your age. Who wouldn't want that? There is increasing evidence that our current biomedical science is capable of extending human life by approximately 10 years. And many companies are swarming to focus on this magic potion. When GlaxoSmithKline GlaxoSmithKline shelled out close to $720 million on Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which said its drug could combat aging, the game was on. Even though this acquisition failed miserably, it started a race to create an anti-aging drug by large pharmaceuticals and young biotech companies like Google's Calico. Calico has partnered with another pharma giant, AbbVie AbbVie, and is on a mission to reverse engineer the biology that controls lifespan and allow humans to prolong healthy lives with its $500 million investment into this project.\n\nCurrently, there are already over 100 drugs that have been found to combat aging. One such compound that achieved prominence in aging-related science was reservatrol. Reservatrol is the reason why many doctors encourage drinking red wine. Reservatrol activates an enzyme that is said to slow aging. Therefore, many pharmaceuticals saw this as a potential drug, like Sirtris. Although the effects of resveratrol in rodents have shown significant improvements, questions have emerged surrounding the effectiveness on humans. In recent years, another compound, rapamycin (TOR) kinase, has emerged as a key pathway that mediates life span extension.\n\nOne such company at the forefront of this research is Novartis. Novartis's drug is a form of rapamycin, a compound that blocks genetic pathways that cause aging. According to its research with 200 volunteers who received the rapamycin treatment for a period of weeks, there was a 20% stronger immune response when the flu vaccine was administered. Although this drug will not be available for commercialization for at least 10 years, the potential for a viable product could create a new segment in the anti-aging market.\n\nHowever, until then, the unregulated anti-aging market is bound to see many products like Elysium's Basis, a blue pill that is believed to cause the same effects as a low-calorie diet and has proven to make mice live longer. The drug is expected to be profitable, despite the absence of human trials.\n\nTo date, it remains unclear whether reservatrol and similar compounds have significant effect on humans. Although marketing of unregulated \"anti-aging\" supplements that contain reservatrol has proven to be a lucrative business, there is very little evidence of the drug's effect in combating aging. In contrast to reservatrol, there is abundant literature indicating that rapamycin has efficacy in people as both immune-suppressants and anti-cancer drugs. This compound has already gone through human trials for various diseases and shows better promise of getting FDA approval than reservatrol. The FDA-backed product will most likely eradicate the unregulated anti-aging market.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Xiaomi [XTC.UL], China's largest smartphone company, will begin selling headphones, smart wristbands and other accessories online in the United States in coming months, taking its first tentative step onto Apple Inc's home turf without its signature Mi mobile devices.\n\nThe company also said it is close to securing a manufacturing partner in Brazil, which will help it skirt punishing tariffs on imported electronics when it begins sales in Latin America's largest economy in the first half of this year.\n\nXiaomi, a five-year-old upstart whose name means \"Little Rice,\" came out of nowhere to become China's fastest-selling mobile brand. It has been rapidly expanding its global footprint through direct, online sales.\n\nThe company was valued at $45 billion (29 billion pounds) in a December funding round that drew investors ranging from Singapore's sovereign wealth fund to a private capital firm backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd co-founder Jack Ma.\n\nIts Mi devices, which scored with Chinese users because of their low cost and the company's heavy reliance on user interaction and feedback, are now sold online across Asia, including most recently India.\n\nBrazil marks the company's first foray with smartphones outside of its home continent. Global operations vice president Hugo Barra said Xiaomi intends to begin selling its phones there in the first half of this year.\n\nThe company is in \"extremely advanced discussions\" with at least half a dozen manufacturing partners there, Barra, a former Google Inc executive, said without revealing names, which will help it side-step a roughly 60 percent tax on foreign electronics.\n\nThe industry is particularly curious about Xiaomi's potential to make a dent in the United States, which is the world's biggest mobile market in dollar terms but one where phone sales are controlled by telecoms carriers and where Apple holds sway.\n\nCo-founder and President Lin Bin told reporters on Thursday that Xiaomi will launch its first online sales site, Mi.com, in a few months, directly selling items from earphones to smart bands to American consumers.\n\nThe company is eschewing bigger-ticket items like phones and tablets for now partly because of the United States' carrier-sales and phone subsidy structure, which eliminates Xiaomi's cost advantage. More generally, Bin and Barra talked about the time and effort needed to tailor its MIUI Android-based operating systems for individual markets and obtain certification, among other things.\n\nXiaomi's main intention for now is to engage American consumers and try and build a community there the same way it has in China and India - through fan events, interaction with users on social media such as a dedicated Facebook page, and gradually coming to know both local preferences and building its brand.\n\nFor example, Barra told Reuters how Xiaomi might put its self-branded headphones in front of U.S. audiophiles and tweak the product depending on their detailed feedback.\n\n\"We're keen on being in the conversation in the U.S.,\" he told reporters.\n\n(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nChina s Xiaomi to start small in U.S., with earphones and bands - The West Australian Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr", "It would be easy to make fun of China's new anthem glorifying internet censorship.

James' wildly popular erotic novel could make more than $60 million over the four-day holiday weekend, which also includes Presidents Day, according to people familiar with prerelease audience surveys.\n\nThat would position it to set a record for the biggest Presidents Day weekend opening - and put the film ahead of fellow box-office newcomer \"Kingsman: The Secret Service,\" which is expected to pull in $30 million to $35 million.\n\nThe Presidents Day weekend is typically a robust time for the industry as moviegoers, many with a day off from work or school Monday, flock to theaters.\n\nCurrently, romantic comedy \"Valentine's Day\" holds the record for the holiday weekend. It debuted to a solid $56.3 million in the U.S. and Canada in February 2010. The previous record holder was 2007's \"Ghost Rider,\" which collected $45.4 million.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which is being released by Universal Pictures, follows kinky billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and his demure love interest Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). Universal is projecting the film will gross a more-modest $50 million over the four-day weekend.\n\nFandango, the nation's largest movie ticket company, reported hundreds of sold-out showings for \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" beginning with the first 8 p.m. screenings on Thursday and running through the weekend.\n\nIn a state-by-state analysis of the advance sales patterns, Fandango said that presales in Southern states were significantly higher than expected.\n\nMovieTickets.com, another ticketing service, reported Wednesday that 75 percent of all tickets it sold in the preceding 24 hours were for \"Fifty Shades.\"\n\nSome theaters are making an event out of it. Cinepolis, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., is selling a \"Valentine's Loveseat Package\" to moviegoers who want to watch the film \"like a total boss.\" The package, offered on Valentine's Day, includes two tickets, a bottle of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" wine, a blanket and a dessert to share.\n\nUniversal utilized the Web to pull in fans through interactive experiences. On the movie's official website, users can visit Mr. Grey's Seattle apartment, unlocking different areas by clicking on various promotional items around the virtual abode.\n\nThere have been some marketing obstacles, however. Some have openly poked fun at the stars for lacking chemistry. After the two presented at the Golden Globes award ceremony, Twitter users pointed out their stiff, awkward interaction, some suggesting the stars hate each other off-screen.\n\nAnd some fans of the book's highly sexual nature have expressed disappointment that only about 20 minutes of the film's 100 minutes reportedly include sex scenes.\n\nRegardless, people have been buzzing over the film on social media. When the trailer was released last July, it racked up 36 million online views in its first week. Since Jan. 1, the film has averaged about 73,000 tweets a day.\n\nFor those not pining for romance, \"Kingsman\" offers up an action alternative.\n\nBased on a comic book, the film follows a street kid (Taron Egerton) after he is recruited into a secret spy organization by Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine also play in the film.\n\nFox partnered with Google to promote the film through an interactive website, \"Become a Kingsman,\" which puts users in control of a major action scene in the movie, allowing them to fight as Firth's character.\n\nAfter users click the \"become a Kingsman\" button, a message pops up that reads: \"I hear you're keen to become a Kingsman knight. My compliments on your superb taste in international intelligence agencies. To join Kingsman, first you have to prove your potential. Your life will only be put in danger half a dozen times, nothing to worry about. Right, off you go.\"\n\nThe R-rated film is likely to draw a largely male audience and attract moviegoers who want to avoid the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" fandom.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount Pictures' \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,\" which was No. 1 last weekend, should again attract families and teenagers. It could add about $30 million.\n\nWar drama \"American Sniper\" may cross the $300 million mark domestically. The Clint Eastwood film, which is nominated for six Academy Awards, has pulled in roughly $284 million in the U.S. and Canada to date.\n\n\"Jupiter Ascending\" is also likely to stay in the top five by adding a projected $10 million to $15 million.", "WILSON, N.C. -- Visual effects artist Brad Kalinoski knows how to add drama, action, comedy and a lot more to Hollywood movies and TV shows.\n\nAnd he does it right here from Wilson with a complex series of computer hookups, shipping the completed work quickly via a Greenlight gigabit connection from his home.\n\nThe fast, fiber-optic service lured him and his wife, Tina Wallace, to Wilson.\n\nKalinoski's film credits represent some of the most recognized titles of the past 16 years, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,\" \"Fantastic Four,\"\n\n\"War of the Worlds,\" \"The Bourne Supremacy,\" \"Spider-Man 2,\" \"X-Men 2,\" \"The Matrix Reloaded,\" \"Men in Black II\" and numerous others, including TV titles and commercial work.\n\nHe can take shots of actors and place a burning building behind them or place a crowd of thousands behind an actor, seemingly listening to their every word.\n\nHe does this work via computer by putting them on green screen. He can do other things as well on film such as elongate an actor's fingers or add a skin rash.\n\nMaking the digital shots is tedious work. But everything today -- movies, TV and commercials -- requires visual effects shots.\n\nThe Academy-award winning film \"Black Swan,\" which garnered Kalinoski a BAFTA Film Award co-nomination (the British equivalent to the Academy Awards) for best special visual effects, took 350 digital shots.\n\nKalinoski is largely self-taught, a process that took him six months while he abandoned a career as a nursing assistant, something that simply wasn't his calling.\n\n\"I was always an artist. Back when I was in high school I was always taking art classes,\" Kalinoski recalls. \"I also always had an interest in film. But the two were never married together.\"\n\nHis interest in computers was what managed to meld the two into a dream career.\n\n\"My first computer was when I was 10 years old, an Atari 400,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"I was programming and writing code when I was 11 or\n\n12 years old, and in the '80s when the computer and the art came together I found my niche and I was at the right place at the right time. It took me about six months. I was a nurse (assistant) at a hospital for 10 years, and I quit and it took six months to go through every book and every piece of software that could teach me exactly what I was getting myself into and then I went to LA.\"\n\nAt the time it was all new. There just weren't a lot of reference points from which to learn. But there were opportunities.\n\nKalinoski's work is what's known as post production and compositor work. But one shot can take up to a month to do.\n\nHe did 10 shots for Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3.\n\n\"It's tedious work,\" Kalinoski said. \"A lot of my shots were the Kraken, a lot of tentacles in Pirates 3. There are a lot of passes; you have to add light, shadow, a consistent and constant change.\"\n\nBut that's not the hardest challenge.\n\n\"The hardest thing to do is to read the director's mind, making sure you get exactly what he wants,\" Kalinoski said. \"There is a high probability of missing.\"\n\nA 20-hour day is not unusual.\n\nHis credits also include \"Snakes on a Plane,\" where unsurprisingly he added snakes. They were all computer generated.\n\nDifferent movies bring different challenges.\n\n\"'Pirates' is pre-planned out, has a lot of money put behind it,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"'Black Swan' was cheaper and wasn't really planned for a lot of visual effects. The studio liked the film, the rough cut of it, and kept adding and adding.\"\n\nIn \"The King's Speech,\" another film he worked on, they added the crowd so the king had someone to hear his speech.\n\n\"Anytime he walked out to the balcony it was CG, all green screen,\"\n\nKalinoski said.\n\nThey recently completed visual effects work on \"The Librarians,\" a popular show now airing on TNT.\n\nThe couple founded Exodus FX, a visual effects company in Wilson.\n\n\"It was born out of the simple fact that in California the dynamics of filmmaking was changing so rapidly because the incentives for other countries and other states -- not North Carolina anymore -- that the work was expanding out, that there was this mass exodus of work and people leaving California, and we decided to form this company called Exodus FX simply because all the special effects were leaving and we could do it. And the technology has caught up to the point where we could work anywhere we want as long as we have a decent broadband option,\" Kalinoski said. \"That's one of the reasons we moved to Wilson because the cost of living, cost of doing business and the Internet infrastructure they had was the best around.\"\n\nThe two scouted out places from Japan to Austin, Texas.\n\n\"In Hollywood the overhead and cost is astronomical,\" he said. \"We just did a Google search and googled for cities and municipalities that had fiber to the home.\"\n\nKalinoski has to fly to LA sometimes and visit the studios. He was there long enough to make the connections he needs.\n\n\"They know me and know my work,\" Kalinoski said. \"It's all about contacts. That's the way it works.\"\n\nKalinoski is concerned about the General Assembly's decision to abandon incentives for filmmakers in the state. It has gutted some of the areas once thriving for filmmaking.\n\n\"Productions we were depending on coming into North Carolina, now they are all gone,\" he said. \"If they would have kept it, it would have helped us expand or bring other companies here because there was a lot of work being shot in North Carolina for years, and we were looking at that when we moved to North Carolina.\n\n\"There is a ton of work in Wilmington, and the tax incentives have been there and suddenly they disappear,\" he said. \"And for us, it really doesn't hurt us too much as a visual effects company; we just find the work that's shooting wherever and provide that service. But in order for us to expand and get bigger, we were relying on some of the productions that were going to be here in North Carolina.\"\n\nHe noted the incentives worked for years.\n\n\"How many years have they had film production in Wilmington and it was only expanding, about 6,000 people had jobs,\" Kalinoski said. \"Film incentives work really well when you have television productions actually set foot in your state and stay here and keep those people working. Those incentives work. TV shows and video game companies can be very lucrative.\"\n\nNow there has been an exodus of sorts from North Carolina as those incentives dried up.\n\n\"They didn't see there was any promise of them coming back,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers are expected to revisit last year's controversial decision to dismantle the state's film incentives, leaving it a de-facto grant program.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is proposing dismantling state laws to allow the expansion of municipal broadband services such as Greenlight.\n\nIt also puts Wilson at the center of the national broadband battle as policy-making develops. Wheeler issued a statement Monday indicating support for the request made by Wilson and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nWheeler said that communities know broadband access is a key to economic development. A vote is set for Feb. 26.\n\nThe fact that Wilson is at the center of a national broadband battle isn't lost on Kalinoski, who has followed the city's efforts to expand and is supportive.\n\n\"We want to be as proactive with that as possible,\" he said. \"Comcast told us Greenlight was a joke -- they are using old copper wiring and when it rains the speed is going to drop, and I'm like, 'I'm not an idiot. I've been involved in this for years.'\"\n\nHe'll give Greenlight officials speed updates on how things are going from his pretty impressive, complex computer setup at his home.\n\n\"It takes a lot of horsepower to complete what we do,\" he said.\n\nThey have four PCs, two built by him and two purchased from Asus and Alienware.\n\nThey have two tablets for \"mouse\" control. There are three iMacs just for basic data use.\n\n\"Our software is specifically designed and made for this type of work,\" he said. \"All the equipment would take up one regular size closet, along with switchers, routers and server. It's not as bad as it was in the 1990s when I would need one entire room and 20 computers to do what we do, and it would take twice as long.\"\n\nLuring people to Wilson for the Greenlight service has been part of the plan to support the economic health of the community all along, said Will Aycock, Greenlight's general manager.\n\nAycock said Wilson's recent fight hasn't been by chance.\n\n\"We are doing what we are doing right now because we were paying attention to the conversation,\" Aycock said. \"When Wheeler came out and started talking about promoting competition and municipal entry, our ears perked up. Here is the chairman saying competition is good, and municipal entry can be a positive. That gave us reason to say we have a good story, we're succeeding, and we're bringing value to this community and we're going to participate in this conversation and tell people what we're doing.\"\n\nKalinoski has gotten to know Wilson officials including Mayor Bruce Rose.\n\n\"Brad is a great friend to us,\" Aycock said. \"Brad is a member of this community and wouldn't have been otherwise. There are a few other businesses like that now, but it was also a general goal of Greenlight to improve quality of life and infrastructure.\"\n\nKalinoski and his wife met in Huntington, West Virginia, where he grew up.\n\n\"She's a genius,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nThey've been working together for 16 years, and she has her own list of impressive film credits.\n\n\"It's all hard work,\" Kalinoski said. \"If it wasn't hard everybody would be doing it.\"\n\nHe broke into the industry through family and industry connections.\n\nHis best friend worked as an apprentice for Christopher Tucker, who did prosthetics for the Cantina sequence in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThey flew out to California to meet one of his friends in the industry. His friend did interviews and got hired to work on \"The Simpsons.\"\n\n\"After he did that for about a year, he was like, 'Dude, just do it,'\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"My wife was like, 'Screw it; just do it.' My wife and best friend pushed me into making that leap. My mom's and dad's advice was, 'Son, if it doesn't work out promise us two things: don't go into porn and don't sell drugs.'\"\n\nThe couple lived in Hollywood 16 years. They have been in Wilson about two years and bought a house.\n\n\"We think there is potential because of the broadband to bring a lot of other companies here, a lot more interest, not just films and TV, but for content creation, the Web. I think there is a big opportunity there,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nBut he worries the loss of film incentives and other tough losses such as Historic Tax Credits could thwart promising potential.\n\n\"We're happy,\" he said. \"If they'd bring back the incentives we'd be more happy.\"\n\nInformation from: The Wilson Daily Times, http://www.wilsondaily.com", "Xiaomi, the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, is coming stateside, but not in the way pundits expected.\n\nThe company announced at a conference Thursday that its e-commerce website, Mi.com, could start selling products to U.S. customers in five months. Surprisingly, smartphones will not be among them -- at least, at first.\n\nInstead, Hugo Barra, Xiaomi's Global VP, suggested the company might start with items such as a recently-launched pair of headphones and its popular external battery pack, the latter of which sold 15 million units in 2014. The company has no immediate plans for bringing its handsets to the U.S., he added.\n\n\"We might try things in small volumes and see how it goes,\" Barra told Mashable. The former Google VP, who managed Android development before joining Xiaomi in 2013, said the Chinese company might also use social media polls to see which products might sell well stateside. \"We'll actually gain a lot of experience from selling these products here because we'll get a lot of feedback that will actually be globally relevant for us.\"\n\nThat may be true, but rolling out in the U.S. initially with several accessories instead of its cash cow is a pretty safe way for Xiaomi to better understand the U.S. market and decide the best distribution channels without betting the farm. Is launching Mi.com in America enough? How much of an in-store presence should Xiaomi have, if any?\n\nXiaomi's experimental U.S. launch also affords the company a testbed for marketing. While Xiaomi has fast become the third-largest smartphone maker in the world, second only to Apple and Samsung, Xiaomi remains virtually unknown to mainstream America.\n\nThe smartphone maker must also shake a reputation for emulating Apple's hardware and software design, albeit at much lower prices. Its new, flagship smartphone, the Mi Note, technically trumps Apple's latest smartphones spec-for-spec but bears a pretty close resemblance to the iPhone 6 Plus. In fact, the Note's most differentiating feature may be price: at $329 without a carrier contract, the Mi Note costs less than half of an unlocked iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nThe company's challenge in the U.S market isn't just around building a U.S. presence but setting itself apart from Apple, as well as the hundreds of affordable Android devices up for grabs. If Xiaomi actually finds a way to accomplish all those things, it may realize its ambitious goal of having a true global presence.\n\n\"We have world class products available at awesome prices, so why not bring them here?\" Barra said. \"We needed to build momentum and a team with international skills to be able to do something like this. We're not there yet, but we'll be there in a few months.\"", "Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S.\n\nAlthough its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans Thursday to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online, hewing to the Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding.\n\nXiaomi -- pronounced schow-mee -- has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story. (***)", "What if you could complain directly to Google about every little thing that bothered you about the Android operating system? And what if every time you complained, Google fixed a bug just for you?\n\nThe Chinese handset maker, Xiaomi, has built an empire of 100 million users worldwide on this exact premise. \"We're an Internet company,\" said Bin Lin, President of Xiaomi, at a press event on Thursday. \"We're not just interested in making handsets.\"\n\nWhile it's true that Xiaomi has been particularly successful selling directly to customers rather than through other retailers or carriers, that's not what Lin was referring to. He was boasting about the company's massive user base overseas, which has grown rapidly thanks to savvy social media tactics. \"They are not our customers, they are our fans,\" added Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who left in 2012 to serve as Vice President of Global Operations at Xiaomi.\n\nXiaomi has gone to great lengths to accommodate these \"fans.\" For instance, when the company launched its first ROM in 2010, there were only 100 users, but after it started making devices and its marketshare grew, Xiaomi honored those that had stuck with them from the beginning by printing their name in the MIUI boot loader.\n\nThen there was the time a fan requested that Xiaomi make it easier to turn on the flashlight from the Lock screen. He argued that his parents wouldn't have caught him coming home drunk if he wouldn't have made such a racket dropping his keys. A week later, the developers pushed out a software update that included that exact feature. \"Everything we do is with social as a platform,\" said Barra. \"Every market we enter has its differences, but at the core everyone is social, everyone is emotional, everyone loves to be spoken to -- to be marketed at.\"\n\nXiaomi's entrance into the U.S. mobile market will incorporate some of the tactics that have made it famous overseas. Although the company won't initially sell phones and tablets -- Barra said \"the amount of effort required to bring those products to market is significant\" -- it does plan to appeal to U.S. customers (sorry, fans) in a similar manner. Barra cited its recent success in India. \"When we entered India, we didn't know how things were going to turn out. India got it. They understood what we were coming to market with...We were bringing more than anyone had ever brought.\"\n\nUnlike India, the US already has \"more.\" It has Apple, Samsung, HTC, LG, Microsoft, and a whole array of manufacturers vying for marketshare. It also has carriers; most customers don't buy smartphones and tablets directly from the manufacturer when they can get the device subsidized from their cellular provider. There's incentive there that Xiaomi will have to compete with, not to mention a pattern that users have become accustomed to ever since mobile phones became a necessity.\n\nThere's also the question of how Xiaomi plans to market to the everyman -- users that aren't necessarily \"in the know,\" but who do a little research for their bi-annual phone upgrades. I asked Barra about this -- about how he'd get someone like my Mom onboard the Xiaomi train -- and he bluntly answered, \"You'll buy her one.\" Essentially, Xiaomi is banking on its existing \"fans\" to convert their friends and family members, too.\n\nUnfortunately, we won't get to see Xiaomi's plan in action for some time, since it's limited on what it can sell here in the U.S. But the company is very optimistic about its future stateside. \"Building a fan base [in the U.S.] is no different than how we built a fan base in India,\" said Lin. \"Driving marketshare and having a great experience...is really the most important goal for us.\"", "We didn't get to see a top-secret new tablet or hear plans to sell phones in the U.S, but that doesn't mean that Xiaomi's stop in Silicon Valley was without revelations.\n\nFirst, the company said it plans to start selling accessories in the U.S., even if it won't sell big ticket items here. Also, not only doesn't it plan an IPO this year, it doesn't have one on the road map any time soon.\n\nBut, there were other interesting tidbits scattered through the long presentation from Hugo Barra and Bin Lin, as well as the ensuing question-and-answer period.\n\nXiaomi may be the third-biggest phone maker in the world, but it thinks of itself as an Internet company. In part, that's because the company makes little to no money from its devices, but one day hopes to cash in on the huge community it has built by selling paid-for services. That effort is in its infancy through things like phone themes and other add-ons.\n\nGeographically, Lin says, the company is targeting places with big populations and a growing appetite for e-commerce. Brazil is already in the works and due to launch later this year. Russia is high on Lin's list, along with the Middle East, other parts of Latin America and other parts of Asia.\n\nIntellectual property concern, Lin conceded, is a factor, but a lesser one than those others, he said. He said that all phone makers have to deal with patent issues and Xiaomi is not alone in that area. There is widespread speculation that the company will avoid launching in the U.S., for example, to avoid litigation from Apple and others. However, Lin says it has more to do with the fact that carriers still subsidize a lot of the devices sold in the U.S. That make customers less likely to appreciate the value that Xiaomi can deliver, Lin said.\n\nFrom a product standpoint, the connected home is the next big frontier for Xiaomi. The company has a $3 module that device makers can use to turn their existing appliances into smart ones, and Xiaomi is also aggressively looking to invest in an partner with smart-home players. It has already invested in Misfit, among other companies. It also wants all of the smart devices to be controlled from a single Mi Home app.\n\n3. Xiaomi has come to praise Google, not bury it.\n\n\"We are a very strong supporter of Google,\" Barra said during the event, adding that contrary to popular believe, Xiaomi isn't looking to fork Google's Android platform at all. He said that what it has done with its operating system is similar to the customization attempted by other handset makers. He said the main difference is just the success it has had in adding features customers want. At the same time, he hastened to add that Xiaomi has been among the quickest handset makers to upgrade to new versions of Android. The current MiUI 6 is based on Kit Kat, with a Lollipop version in the works.\n\n4. Xiaomi updates its software quickly -- like really quickly.\n\nThe company updates its software every Friday, based in part on reaction from its customers. It spends Monday through Wednesday coding the incremental updates, tests them internally on Thursday and releases them on Friday. Saturday and Sunday are spent examining the real-world feedback and planning for the following week. The company has done so for the past 224 weeks and counting.\n\n5. Xiaomi has a very, very active community.\n\nThe company has 40 million active users on its forums. Yesterday, there were 169,000 posts -- and that was a slow day. Some days there are 500,000 new posts to its Chinese forums.\n\n6. Xiaomi does so care about patents. And it is filing for a lot of its own.\n\nThe company filed for 2,800 patents last year, including in places like the U.S., Japan and Korea. It plans to double its patent applications this year and next.\n\n\"IP litigation is going to be part of any company,\" Lin said. \"This is something we expect happens. We just don't know when.\"", "Most people in the U.S. have never heard of Xiaomi. The five-year-old company is the number five smartphone manufacturer in the world and says it sold 61 million smartphones last year.\n\nNow the Beijing-based company wants people in the U.S. to know all about its tablets, phones, and customized Android operating system, MIUI.\n\nThe only catch is, there are no plans to actually sell these things in the U.S. anytime soon. There is a tangle of IP, patent and carrier issues that Xiaomi would have to overcome to sell mobile devices in the U.S.\n\nInstead, it's launching a limited version of its popular e-commerce store, Mi.com, in the states later this year. It won't sell the phones or tablets, only a selection of smaller branded products like headphones, air purifiers, smart home devices, and the oddly popular Mi Bunnies (plush bunnies wearing adorable outfits), of which it's sold 1.97 million.\n\nRelated: This is the Apple of China\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [iPhones and tables] to market is significant,\" said Xiaomi vice president Hugo Barra, who was previously a vice president at Google (GOOG). \"So we're accelerating our entry, in a sense, by bringing in simpler products.\"\n\nDuring a press event in San Francisco on Thursday, Xiaomi president Lin Bin and Barra went over the company's various hardware products, mobile operating system features and meme-heavy marketing approach in excruciating detail.\n\n\"A lot of their success in China is because they have very tightly integrated and localized features in their operating system,\" said Ben Bajarian, an analyst at Creative Strategies.\n\nIn selfie-loving China, that means the front camera estimates age and gender and applies automatic \"beautification\" filters. There are anti-spam call tools, and pre-written greetings for local holidays and festivals. Notifications are strictly controlled to keep users from being overwhelmed.\n\n\"We curate the hell out of this ecosystem to make sure people have more peaceful lives,\" said Barra.\n\nRelated: Xiaomi's new phone wants to be an iPhone killer\n\nLast year, Xiaomi sold 61 million phones and increased its revenue 135%. It sells mobile devices in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and recently expanded into India. Its MUIU operating system could easily appeal to customers in the United States who fall somewhere in the middle of the Android/iOS spectrum.\n\n\"It's essentially them attempting to test this market,\" said Bajarin.\n\nIn China, Xiaomi relies heavily on social media and a loyal fanbase to do a lot of its marketing. There are regular meet-up events where people perform songs about Xiaomi. Some \"fans\" (the companies preferred euphemism for users) shave the logo into their hair, others Photoshop images of the company's eight founders into famous movie posters.\n\nXiaomi doesn't yet have that kind of enthusiastic, organic user base in the U.S. That's why, at least for now, it's focusing on making more Americans aware of its brand, not winning them over as users.", "MENLO PARK -- It's Facebook's version of a social media will.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people documenting their lives on the social network, Facebook users now have a choice about how much of a digital trail they want to leave behind after death.\n\nThe world's most popular social media website introduced a new feature on Thursday that allows its users to choose one person, such as a family member or friend, to manage their account after they've died. They can also let the social network know if they want their account permanently deleted after death.\n\nBefore, family members had to contact the social network to get the account frozen or memorialized.\n\n\"After speaking with people who had gone through the memorialization process on Facebook we thought we could improve the experience for those who were grieving and also give more controls to the account holder,\" said Jodi Seth, a Facebook representative.\n\nThe \"legacy contact\" will be able to announce a memorial service or share a post on the deceased person's timeline, respond to friend requests, and update the person's profile and cover photo. The designated person will also be able to download photos, posts and profile information if the user gives them permission to do so. They can't see private messages or alter the deceased's posts.\n\nThe feature was introduced in the United States on Thursday, and Facebook said it plans to expand it to more countries.\n\nWhile some social media users think that keeping up their Facebook page helps memorialize their life, others feel it may prolong the grief for family and friends.\n\nSan Jose resident Frances Herbert said her brother died three years ago, and his Facebook account was left behind.\n\n\"It was his account, his password. It's been stuck in limbo, just up there,\" she said.\n\nSome users posted remarks memorializing her brother, while others didn't seem to realize that her brother was dead. And when it came to contacting Facebook to take her brother's account down, Herbert felt it wasn't her sole decision to make.\n\n\"It would be beneficial to designate one person to manage (the account),\" Herbert said.\n\nEvan Carroll, co-author of \"Your Digital Afterlife,\" said he's pleased with the new feature because it puts the control in the user's hands. Facebook's new feature is in line with how companies such as Google have dealt with the digital afterlife, he said.\n\nIn 2013, Google launched a feature that allows users to tell the company what they want to happen to their data and email messages if their account becomes inactive.\n\n\"It's often hard for the next kin to make those decision because they don't know what the deceased would have wanted,\" Carroll said.", "The world's biggest social network unveiled an update in the US that allows its members to designate a \"legacy contact\". Source: AFP\n\nYou can finally decide what happens to your Facebook account when you die.\n\nIn a change of heart, the world's most popular social network will begin allowing its members to designate someone-what they call a \"legacy contact\"-to manage parts of their accounts posthumously. Members can also choose to have their presence deleted entirely.\n\nFacebook and other internet services walk a difficult tightrope between respecting the privacy of the deceased and the demands of grieving friends and family. Previously, Facebook automatically froze the accounts of members it learned had died, angering some heirs who wanted to edit the deceased's online presence. It will roll out the new options to members in the US on Thursday, with others to follow later.\n\nAsking us to make plans for a digital afterlife may sound morbid, but it can bring clarity to an issue that's both legally and emotionally challenging. In 2013, Google became the first major Internet company to allow users to select digital heirs for its Gmail, cloud storage and other services, dubbed \"inactive account managers.\"\n\nIf they're granted prior permission, legacy contacts can also download an archive of posts and photos from the deceased, but not the contents of his or her private messages.\n\nAll of this is optional. If you do nothing, when Facebook finds out you've passed, it will simply freeze your account and leave posts and pictures at the privacy settings you determined, a process it calls memorialisation. Facebook says it has done this to hundreds of thousands of accounts to date. (As before, Facebook won't show advertisements on memorialised accounts.)\n\nBeing a legacy contact is different from simply logging into the account of the deceased, and there are important things legacy contacts can't alter. They can't edit what the deceased has already posted, or what his or her friends post on the page. If you chose to post a photo while you are living that looks embarrassing when you are gone, your legacy contact can't do anything about it. A legacy contact also can't decide to delete a whole account.\n\nThese restrictions might upset some people who think their job as a caretaker is to maintain a Facebook page as the nicest possible memorial. \"We gave this a lot of thought, and ultimately decided against it for this first version,\" said spokeswoman Jodi Seth. Facebook feared that curation responsibilities might add an extra emotional load to grieving, among other concerns.\n\nTo select your legacy contact, go to Settings and choose Security and then Legacy Contact at the bottom of the page-it's the same for the Facebook website or mobile app. There you can designate an existing Facebook friend (in other words, only someone who's already part of the social network), grant that person permission to download an archive of your data, or choose to have your account deleted after death.\n\nThere's more fine print worth paying attention to: You can only select one person-and no backup-so spouses and partners who often travel together may face a difficult choice about whether to designate each other. Ms. Seth says Facebook is continuing to think about how it might allow for contingent legacy contacts.\n\nFacebook members can change their legacy contact selection at any time, but once they've died, a legacy contact can't pass along the responsibility to someone else.\n\nIf you don't choose a legacy contact on Facebook but name a digital heir in a legal will, Facebook will designate that person.\n\nIt's exhausting to think that Facebook has become so interwoven into our lives that we not only have to think about setting our birthdays, relationships and jobs in stone there, but now also our deaths. Still, Facebook's new service empowers people to make choices about their data while they're living, and for many, that's a relief.", "NEW YORK (AP) - A wave of deals in the online travel industry has increasingly put some familiar names under two corporate umbrellas: Expedia and Priceline.\n\nFor now, industry executives and travel experts say, consumers won't notice much of an impact.

The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280.

Goliaths such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix and Facebook -- as well as myriad start-ups -- have overhauled the economy and changed the way people lead their lives and conduct their business.\n\nBut the Internet has long been in danger of being co-opted by its least competitive and innovative part: its service providers.\n\nTo varying degrees these ISPs, such as Verizon and Comcast, have looked at the spectacular success of Silicon Valley and decided that they should get a cut of the action. So it's great news that the Federal Communications Commission, after years of delay, is set to stop this from happening.\n\nIn a column published last week in Wired, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and wireless industries, said he would propose rigorous \"net neutrality\" rules that would restrain his former clients. A vote is set for later this month, and Wheeler's plan appears to have sufficient support to pass.\n\nNet neutrality bars service providers from creating \"fast lanes\" for content companies that pay, or \"slow lanes\" for those that won't. This would prevent an ISP from forcing itself into partnerships with its richer high-tech brethren. It would also keep high-tech companies from using their clout to beat back emerging competitors. The most immediate effect would likely be an end to a deal that Netflix signed with Comcast for faster service.\n\nFor consumers, net neutrality would ensure that the Internet isn't transformed from an open platform into a marketplace where people are steered to content that costs money. It might also mean lower costs, as anything content providers pay to ISPs is likely to be passed on to consumers.\n\nFor years, the FCC tried to impose rules that would have prevented the worst excesses while hoping that the ISPs could become more competitive. But courts kept blocking those rules. The only way around is for the FCC to reclassify ISPs as something akin to public utilities, using its power under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThat's a big step, one that Wheeler, as the swing vote on the commission, has been reluctant to embrace. The move, expected to be challenged in the courts, amounts to regulating ISPs.\n\nBut the plan is a far cry from government \"taking over\" the Internet, as some critics charge. The early Internet, in its dial-up stage, would never have succeeded if not for regulations. AT&T was forced by government to interconnect with non-AT&T networking equipment. And it, as well as its successor \"Baby Bells,\" were forced by government to operate as common carriers, refraining from interfering with the content passing over their wires.\n\nA decade ago, Ed Whitacre, the former head of SBC (now AT&T) said that he was determined to extract revenue from companies like Google that want to \"use my pipes free.\" His successors appear similarly determined.\n\nSometimes, rules on uncompetitive companies are necessary to allow more competitive ones to thrive. It was true in the age of dial-up. And it's still true today.\n\n-- USA TODAY\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://oshko.sh/1DmAedm", "Think you know a lot about the news?\n\nMaybe you know nothing about the news.\n\nEither way, this column will work out well for you.\n\nIt's the news of the week, delivered trivia-style.\n\nThis past week, Orlando made headlines for being ranked as:\n\nA) One of the most creative cities in America.\n\nB) One of the most romantic cities in America.\n\nC) Having the most polite drivers in America.\n\nAnswer: Both A and B are true -- which is pretty cool.

Now, full control over that belongs to you. Starting today, you can designate someone on Facebook as your \"legacy contact,\" enabling them to manage basic functions of your account after your death.\n\nAssigning someone as your legacy contact has very different implications than simply giving an heir your Facebook password. Your legacy contact will be able to pin a memorial message at the top of your profile, change your profile picture and respond to new friend requests on your behalf. They will not, however, be able to post as you, edit posts left by others, access your private messages, delete content or delete your account as a whole.\n\nYour Facebook account will be frozen and memorialized upon your death if you choose not to name a legacy contact. If you do not choose a legacy contact but name a digital heir in your will, Facebook will be able to name that heir as your legacy contact posthumously.\n\nSetting a Facebook legacy contact is optional, but Techlicious highly recommends you take a moment out of your day to do so for peace of mind. It can be done in seconds by going to Settings > Security > Legacy Contact. The person you designate must be a Facebook member.

The cybersecurity order comes on the heels of an announcement that the US government will establish a new center for cybersecurity.\n\nThe executive order also comes at a time when companies have grown increasingly defensive about providing government access to their products in the wake of National Security Agency revelations by Edward Snowden. It has been said that the Snowden revelations have cost US tech firms billions of dollars in lost business as people around the globe take steps to protect their data from the US government.\n\nReuters reports that the government would like Silicon Valley firms such as Google and Apple to share information with them, but those companies have balked at the suggestion without wide ranging reforms to the NSA's data collection practices.\n\nThis impasse in how to deal with the issue of cybersecurity has led many major tech firms to keep their highest-ranking personnel away from the Stanford conference.

James' wildly popular erotic novel could make more than $60 million over the four-day holiday weekend, which also includes Presidents Day, according to people familiar with prerelease audience surveys.\n\nThat would position it to set a record for the biggest Presidents Day weekend opening - and put the film ahead of fellow box-office newcomer \"Kingsman: The Secret Service,\" which is expected to pull in $30 million to $35 million.\n\nThe Presidents Day weekend is typically a robust time for the industry as moviegoers, many with a day off from work or school Monday, flock to theaters.\n\nCurrently, romantic comedy \"Valentine's Day\" holds the record for the holiday weekend. It debuted to a solid $56.3 million in the U.S. and Canada in February 2010. The previous record holder was 2007's \"Ghost Rider,\" which collected $45.4 million.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which is being released by Universal Pictures, follows kinky billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and his demure love interest Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson).

Cinepolis, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., is selling a \"Valentine's Loveseat Package\" to moviegoers who want to watch the film \"like a total boss.\" The package, offered on Valentine's Day, includes two tickets, a bottle of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" wine, a blanket and a dessert to share.\n\nUniversal utilized the Web to pull in fans through interactive experiences. On the movie's official website, users can visit Mr. Grey's Seattle apartment, unlocking different areas by clicking on various promotional items around the virtual abode.\n\nThere have been some marketing obstacles, however. Some have openly poked fun at the stars for lacking chemistry. After the two presented at the Golden Globes award ceremony, Twitter users pointed out their stiff, awkward interaction, some suggesting the stars hate each other off-screen.\n\nAnd some fans of the book's highly sexual nature have expressed disappointment that only about 20 minutes of the film's 100 minutes reportedly include sex scenes.\n\nRegardless, people have been buzzing over the film on social media. When the trailer was released last July, it racked up 36 million online views in its first week. Since Jan. 1, the film has averaged about 73,000 tweets a day.\n\nFor those not pining for romance, \"Kingsman\" offers up an action alternative.\n\nBased on a comic book, the film follows a street kid (Taron Egerton) after he is recruited into a secret spy organization by Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine also play in the film.\n\nFox partnered with Google to promote the film through an interactive website, \"Become a Kingsman,\" which puts users in control of a major action scene in the movie, allowing them to fight as Firth's character.\n\nAfter users click the \"become a Kingsman\" button, a message pops up that reads: \"I hear you're keen to become a Kingsman knight. My compliments on your superb taste in international intelligence agencies. To join Kingsman, first you have to prove your potential.

He can do other things as well on film such as elongate an actor's fingers or add a skin rash.\n\nMaking the digital shots is tedious work. But everything today -- movies, TV and commercials -- requires visual effects shots.\n\nThe Academy-award winning film \"Black Swan,\" which garnered Kalinoski a BAFTA Film Award co-nomination (the British equivalent to the Academy Awards) for best special visual effects, took 350 digital shots.\n\nKalinoski is largely self-taught, a process that took him six months while he abandoned a career as a nursing assistant, something that simply wasn't his calling.\n\n\"I was always an artist. Back when I was in high school I was always taking art classes,\" Kalinoski recalls. \"I also always had an interest in film. But the two were never married together.\"\n\nHis interest in computers was what managed to meld the two into a dream career.\n\n\"My first computer was when I was 10 years old, an Atari 400,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"I was programming and writing code when I was 11 or\n\n12 years old, and in the '80s when the computer and the art came together I found my niche and I was at the right place at the right time. It took me about six months. I was a nurse (assistant) at a hospital for 10 years, and I quit and it took six months to go through every book and every piece of software that could teach me exactly what I was getting myself into and then I went to LA.\"\n\nAt the time it was all new. There just weren't a lot of reference points from which to learn. But there were opportunities.\n\nKalinoski's work is what's known as post production and compositor work. But one shot can take up to a month to do.\n\nHe did 10 shots for Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3.\n\n\"It's tedious work,\" Kalinoski said. \"A lot of my shots were the Kraken, a lot of tentacles in Pirates 3. There are a lot of passes; you have to add light, shadow, a consistent and constant change.\"\n\nBut that's not the hardest challenge.\n\n\"The hardest thing to do is to read the director's mind, making sure you get exactly what he wants,\" Kalinoski said. \"There is a high probability of missing.\"\n\nA 20-hour day is not unusual.\n\nHis credits also include \"Snakes on a Plane,\" where unsurprisingly he added snakes. They were all computer generated.\n\nDifferent movies bring different challenges.\n\n\"'Pirates' is pre-planned out, has a lot of money put behind it,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"'Black Swan' was cheaper and wasn't really planned for a lot of visual effects. The studio liked the film, the rough cut of it, and kept adding and adding.\"\n\nIn \"The King's Speech,\" another film he worked on, they added the crowd so the king had someone to hear his speech.\n\n\"Anytime he walked out to the balcony it was CG, all green screen,\"\n\nKalinoski said.\n\nThey recently completed visual effects work on \"The Librarians,\" a popular show now airing on TNT.\n\nThe couple founded Exodus FX, a visual effects company in Wilson.\n\n\"It was born out of the simple fact that in California the dynamics of filmmaking was changing so rapidly because the incentives for other countries and other states -- not North Carolina anymore -- that the work was expanding out, that there was this mass exodus of work and people leaving California, and we decided to form this company called Exodus FX simply because all the special effects were leaving and we could do it. And the technology has caught up to the point where we could work anywhere we want as long as we have a decent broadband option,\" Kalinoski said. \"That's one of the reasons we moved to Wilson because the cost of living, cost of doing business and the Internet infrastructure they had was the best around.\"\n\nThe two scouted out places from Japan to Austin, Texas.\n\n\"In Hollywood the overhead and cost is astronomical,\" he said. \"We just did a Google search and googled for cities and municipalities that had fiber to the home.\"\n\nKalinoski has to fly to LA sometimes and visit the studios. He was there long enough to make the connections he needs.\n\n\"They know me and know my work,\" Kalinoski said. \"It's all about contacts. That's the way it works.\"\n\nKalinoski is concerned about the General Assembly's decision to abandon incentives for filmmakers in the state. It has gutted some of the areas once thriving for filmmaking.\n\n\"Productions we were depending on coming into North Carolina, now they are all gone,\" he said. \"If they would have kept it, it would have helped us expand or bring other companies here because there was a lot of work being shot in North Carolina for years, and we were looking at that when we moved to North Carolina.\n\n\"There is a ton of work in Wilmington, and the tax incentives have been there and suddenly they disappear,\" he said. \"And for us, it really doesn't hurt us too much as a visual effects company; we just find the work that's shooting wherever and provide that service. But in order for us to expand and get bigger, we were relying on some of the productions that were going to be here in North Carolina.\"\n\nHe noted the incentives worked for years.\n\n\"How many years have they had film production in Wilmington and it was only expanding, about 6,000 people had jobs,\" Kalinoski said. \"Film incentives work really well when you have television productions actually set foot in your state and stay here and keep those people working. Those incentives work. TV shows and video game companies can be very lucrative.\"\n\nNow there has been an exodus of sorts from North Carolina as those incentives dried up.\n\n\"They didn't see there was any promise of them coming back,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers are expected to revisit last year's controversial decision to dismantle the state's film incentives, leaving it a de-facto grant program.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is proposing dismantling state laws to allow the expansion of municipal broadband services such as Greenlight.\n\nIt also puts Wilson at the center of the national broadband battle as policy-making develops. Wheeler issued a statement Monday indicating support for the request made by Wilson and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nWheeler said that communities know broadband access is a key to economic development. A vote is set for Feb. 26.\n\nThe fact that Wilson is at the center of a national broadband battle isn't lost on Kalinoski, who has followed the city's efforts to expand and is supportive.\n\n\"We want to be as proactive with that as possible,\" he said. \"Comcast told us Greenlight was a joke -- they are using old copper wiring and when it rains the speed is going to drop, and I'm like, 'I'm not an idiot. I've been involved in this for years.'\"\n\nHe'll give Greenlight officials speed updates on how things are going from his pretty impressive, complex computer setup at his home.\n\n\"It takes a lot of horsepower to complete what we do,\" he said.\n\nThey have four PCs, two built by him and two purchased from Asus and Alienware.\n\nThey have two tablets for \"mouse\" control. There are three iMacs just for basic data use.\n\n\"Our software is specifically designed and made for this type of work,\" he said. \"All the equipment would take up one regular size closet, along with switchers, routers and server. It's not as bad as it was in the 1990s when I would need one entire room and 20 computers to do what we do, and it would take twice as long.\"\n\nLuring people to Wilson for the Greenlight service has been part of the plan to support the economic health of the community all along, said Will Aycock, Greenlight's general manager.\n\nAycock said Wilson's recent fight hasn't been by chance.\n\n\"We are doing what we are doing right now because we were paying attention to the conversation,\" Aycock said. \"When Wheeler came out and started talking about promoting competition and municipal entry, our ears perked up. Here is the chairman saying competition is good, and municipal entry can be a positive. That gave us reason to say we have a good story, we're succeeding, and we're bringing value to this community and we're going to participate in this conversation and tell people what we're doing.\"\n\nKalinoski has gotten to know Wilson officials including Mayor Bruce Rose.\n\n\"Brad is a great friend to us,\" Aycock said. \"Brad is a member of this community and wouldn't have been otherwise. There are a few other businesses like that now, but it was also a general goal of Greenlight to improve quality of life and infrastructure.\"\n\nKalinoski and his wife met in Huntington, West Virginia, where he grew up.\n\n\"She's a genius,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nThey've been working together for 16 years, and she has her own list of impressive film credits.\n\n\"It's all hard work,\" Kalinoski said. \"If it wasn't hard everybody would be doing it.\"\n\nHe broke into the industry through family and industry connections.\n\nHis best friend worked as an apprentice for Christopher Tucker, who did prosthetics for the Cantina sequence in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThey flew out to California to meet one of his friends in the industry. His friend did interviews and got hired to work on \"The Simpsons.\"\n\n\"After he did that for about a year, he was like, 'Dude, just do it,'\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"My wife was like, 'Screw it; just do it.' My wife and best friend pushed me into making that leap. My mom's and dad's advice was, 'Son, if it doesn't work out promise us two things: don't go into porn and don't sell drugs.'\"\n\nThe couple lived in Hollywood 16 years. They have been in Wilson about two years and bought a house.\n\n\"We think there is potential because of the broadband to bring a lot of other companies here, a lot more interest, not just films and TV, but for content creation, the Web. I think there is a big opportunity there,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nBut he worries the loss of film incentives and other tough losses such as Historic Tax Credits could thwart promising potential.\n\n\"We're happy,\" he said. \"If they'd bring back the incentives we'd be more happy.\"\n\nInformation from: The Wilson Daily Times, http://www.wilsondaily.com", "By David Koenig And Michelle Chapman, The Associated Press on February 12, 2015.\n\nNEW YORK, N.Y. - A wave of deals in the online travel industry has increasingly put some familiar names under two corporate umbrellas: Expedia and Priceline.\n\nFor now, industry executives and travel experts say, consumers won't notice much of an impact. They will still have plenty of options for booking flights, hotel rooms and vacation packages, including shopping directly with airline and hotel websites.\n\nExpedia said Thursday that it is buying rival Orbitz Worldwide Inc. for about $1.3 billion. The deal adds the Orbitz brand and sites including CheapTickets and HotelClub to a lineup that already includes names such as Hotels.com, Hotwire, Trivago and Australia's Wotif. com. Expedia is also in the process of buying Travelocity.\n\nIn a conference call with analysts, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that even though big in the online segment, his company is \"only a small player\" in a $1.3 trillion travel market that includes giants like Google and many newcomers. Expedia says its booking account for only 4 per cent of global travel spending.\n\nThe purchase of Orbitz would leap Expedia ahead of The Priceline Group Inc. in travel bookings, although Priceline would still be larger by revenue and stock market value. Besides its namesake website, Priceline owns Booking.com, Kayak and restaurant-reservation site OpenTable. Then there are smaller players such as airfare-search site Hipmunk and last-minute deal site HotelTonight.\n\nKhosrowshahi said he was optimistic that antitrust regulators would approve the deal.\n\nSome analysts agreed. They said consolidation in the online travel industry is in the early stages, and it's an industry with low barriers to new entrants.\n\n\"In broad terms, the less players that you have, consumers have less choice ... and obviously less price competition is not good for consumers, but I don't think we're at that point yet,\" said Tuna Amobi of S&P Capital IQ. \"There is still a tremendous amount of alternatives out there to make online travel reservations.\"\n\nDaniel Kurnos, an analyst for The Benchmark Co., said the deal might even help consumers by giving Expedia more size to negotiate better deals with airlines and hotels.\n\nGary Leff, a travel blogger and co-founder of frequent flier discussion website MilePoint, said for most consumers, the deal won't make a big difference. He recommends that consumers use online travel agencies to comparison-shop, but unless there's a reason - such as an itinerary that includes more than airline - it's better to book directly with the airline or hotel.\n\nThat way, if you need to change a trip or there is some other problem, \"it's a whole lot easier dealing just with the airline than with the airline and an online agency,\" he said.\n\nLeff said the industry is evolving, and the winning companies will be those who develop the best mass technology for catering to an individual consumer's preferences - not just finding the cheapest flight.\n\nExpedia will gain Orbitz's highly regarded technology, especially in searching airfares - Orbitz was started in 1999 by five of the largest U.S. airlines to counter the advent of online travel agencies including Expedia. It went public in 2007.\n\nExpedia, based in Bellevue, Washington, said that it will pay $12 per share, a 25 per cent premium to Orbitz's closing price of $9.62 on Wednesday.\n\nThe boards of Expedia and Orbitz approved the sale, but approval would still be needed from a majority of Orbitz shareholders. Expedia said it couldn't predict when the deal would close.\n\nExpedia had 2014 revenue of $5.76 billion. Priceline hasn't reported fourth-quarter results, but in the first nine months of 2014, it had $6.6 billion in revenue compared with Expedia's $4.41 billion. In travel bookings, Priceline had $39.64 billion, Expedia was right behind with $39.14 billion, and Orbitz had $9.69 billion.\n\nShares of Expedia jumped $11.35, or 14.5 per cent, to $89.57; and Orbitz shares rose $2.10, or 21.8 per cent, to $11.72.

He can do other things as well on film such as elongate an actor's fingers or add a skin rash.\n\nMaking the digital shots is tedious work. But everything today -- movies, TV and commercials -- requires visual effects shots.\n\nThe Academy-award winning film \"Black Swan,\" which garnered Kalinoski a BAFTA Film Award co-nomination (the British equivalent to the Academy Awards) for best special visual effects, took 350 digital shots.\n\nKalinoski is largely self-taught, a process that took him six months while he abandoned a career as a nursing assistant, something that simply wasn't his calling.\n\n\"I was always an artist. Back when I was in high school I was always taking art classes,\" Kalinoski recalls. \"I also always had an interest in film. But the two were never married together.\"\n\nHis interest in computers was what managed to meld the two into a dream career.\n\n\"My first computer was when I was 10 years old, an Atari 400,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"I was programming and writing code when I was 11 or\n\n12 years old, and in the '80s when the computer and the art came together I found my niche and I was at the right place at the right time. It took me about six months. I was a nurse (assistant) at a hospital for 10 years, and I quit and it took six months to go through every book and every piece of software that could teach me exactly what I was getting myself into and then I went to LA.\"\n\nAt the time it was all new. There just weren't a lot of reference points from which to learn. But there were opportunities.\n\nKalinoski's work is what's known as post production and compositor work. But one shot can take up to a month to do.\n\nHe did 10 shots for Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3.\n\n\"It's tedious work,\" Kalinoski said. \"A lot of my shots were the Kraken, a lot of tentacles in Pirates 3. There are a lot of passes; you have to add light, shadow, a consistent and constant change.\"\n\nBut that's not the hardest challenge.\n\n\"The hardest thing to do is to read the director's mind, making sure you get exactly what he wants,\" Kalinoski said. \"There is a high probability of missing.\"\n\nA 20-hour day is not unusual.\n\nHis credits also include \"Snakes on a Plane,\" where unsurprisingly he added snakes. They were all computer generated.\n\nDifferent movies bring different challenges.\n\n\"'Pirates' is pre-planned out, has a lot of money put behind it,\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"'Black Swan' was cheaper and wasn't really planned for a lot of visual effects. The studio liked the film, the rough cut of it, and kept adding and adding.\"\n\nIn \"The King's Speech,\" another film he worked on, they added the crowd so the king had someone to hear his speech.\n\n\"Anytime he walked out to the balcony it was CG, all green screen,\"\n\nKalinoski said.\n\nThey recently completed visual effects work on \"The Librarians,\" a popular show now airing on TNT.\n\nThe couple founded Exodus FX, a visual effects company in Wilson.\n\n\"It was born out of the simple fact that in California the dynamics of filmmaking was changing so rapidly because the incentives for other countries and other states -- not North Carolina anymore -- that the work was expanding out, that there was this mass exodus of work and people leaving California, and we decided to form this company called Exodus FX simply because all the special effects were leaving and we could do it. And the technology has caught up to the point where we could work anywhere we want as long as we have a decent broadband option,\" Kalinoski said. \"That's one of the reasons we moved to Wilson because the cost of living, cost of doing business and the Internet infrastructure they had was the best around.\"\n\nThe two scouted out places from Japan to Austin, Texas.\n\n\"In Hollywood the overhead and cost is astronomical,\" he said. \"We just did a Google search and googled for cities and municipalities that had fiber to the home.\"\n\nKalinoski has to fly to LA sometimes and visit the studios. He was there long enough to make the connections he needs.\n\n\"They know me and know my work,\" Kalinoski said. \"It's all about contacts. That's the way it works.\"\n\nKalinoski is concerned about the General Assembly's decision to abandon incentives for filmmakers in the state. It has gutted some of the areas once thriving for filmmaking.\n\n\"Productions we were depending on coming into North Carolina, now they are all gone,\" he said. \"If they would have kept it, it would have helped us expand or bring other companies here because there was a lot of work being shot in North Carolina for years, and we were looking at that when we moved to North Carolina.\n\n\"There is a ton of work in Wilmington, and the tax incentives have been there and suddenly they disappear,\" he said. \"And for us, it really doesn't hurt us too much as a visual effects company; we just find the work that's shooting wherever and provide that service. But in order for us to expand and get bigger, we were relying on some of the productions that were going to be here in North Carolina.\"\n\nHe noted the incentives worked for years.\n\n\"How many years have they had film production in Wilmington and it was only expanding, about 6,000 people had jobs,\" Kalinoski said. \"Film incentives work really well when you have television productions actually set foot in your state and stay here and keep those people working. Those incentives work. TV shows and video game companies can be very lucrative.\"\n\nNow there has been an exodus of sorts from North Carolina as those incentives dried up.\n\n\"They didn't see there was any promise of them coming back,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers are expected to revisit last year's controversial decision to dismantle the state's film incentives, leaving it a de-facto grant program.\n\nMeanwhile, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is proposing dismantling state laws to allow the expansion of municipal broadband services such as Greenlight.\n\nIt also puts Wilson at the center of the national broadband battle as policy-making develops. Wheeler issued a statement Monday indicating support for the request made by Wilson and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nWheeler said that communities know broadband access is a key to economic development. A vote is set for Feb. 26.\n\nThe fact that Wilson is at the center of a national broadband battle isn't lost on Kalinoski, who has followed the city's efforts to expand and is supportive.\n\n\"We want to be as proactive with that as possible,\" he said. \"Comcast told us Greenlight was a joke -- they are using old copper wiring and when it rains the speed is going to drop, and I'm like, 'I'm not an idiot. I've been involved in this for years.'\"\n\nHe'll give Greenlight officials speed updates on how things are going from his pretty impressive, complex computer setup at his home.\n\n\"It takes a lot of horsepower to complete what we do,\" he said.\n\nThey have four PCs, two built by him and two purchased from Asus and Alienware.\n\nThey have two tablets for \"mouse\" control. There are three iMacs just for basic data use.\n\n\"Our software is specifically designed and made for this type of work,\" he said. \"All the equipment would take up one regular size closet, along with switchers, routers and server. It's not as bad as it was in the 1990s when I would need one entire room and 20 computers to do what we do, and it would take twice as long.\"\n\nLuring people to Wilson for the Greenlight service has been part of the plan to support the economic health of the community all along, said Will Aycock, Greenlight's general manager.\n\nAycock said Wilson's recent fight hasn't been by chance.\n\n\"We are doing what we are doing right now because we were paying attention to the conversation,\" Aycock said. \"When Wheeler came out and started talking about promoting competition and municipal entry, our ears perked up. Here is the chairman saying competition is good, and municipal entry can be a positive. That gave us reason to say we have a good story, we're succeeding, and we're bringing value to this community and we're going to participate in this conversation and tell people what we're doing.\"\n\nKalinoski has gotten to know Wilson officials including Mayor Bruce Rose.\n\n\"Brad is a great friend to us,\" Aycock said. \"Brad is a member of this community and wouldn't have been otherwise. There are a few other businesses like that now, but it was also a general goal of Greenlight to improve quality of life and infrastructure.\"\n\nKalinoski and his wife met in Huntington, West Virginia, where he grew up.\n\n\"She's a genius,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nThey've been working together for 16 years, and she has her own list of impressive film credits.\n\n\"It's all hard work,\" Kalinoski said. \"If it wasn't hard everybody would be doing it.\"\n\nHe broke into the industry through family and industry connections.\n\nHis best friend worked as an apprentice for Christopher Tucker, who did prosthetics for the Cantina sequence in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThey flew out to California to meet one of his friends in the industry. His friend did interviews and got hired to work on \"The Simpsons.\"\n\n\"After he did that for about a year, he was like, 'Dude, just do it,'\"\n\nKalinoski said. \"My wife was like, 'Screw it; just do it.' My wife and best friend pushed me into making that leap. My mom's and dad's advice was, 'Son, if it doesn't work out promise us two things: don't go into porn and don't sell drugs.'\"\n\nThe couple lived in Hollywood 16 years. They have been in Wilson about two years and bought a house.\n\n\"We think there is potential because of the broadband to bring a lot of other companies here, a lot more interest, not just films and TV, but for content creation, the Web. I think there is a big opportunity there,\" Kalinoski said.\n\nBut he worries the loss of film incentives and other tough losses such as Historic Tax Credits could thwart promising potential.\n\n\"We're happy,\" he said. \"If they'd bring back the incentives we'd be more happy.\"\n\nInformation from: The Wilson Daily Times, http://www.wilsondaily.com", "Google's latest foray into the open-source realm is a framework it's calling \"PerfKit,\" which is designed to measure application performance in the cloud, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nThe framework has two main components, according to an official blog post - first is the measurement system itself, called Perfkit Benchmarker, which tracks standard metrics like throughput, latency and overhead, in addition to overall resource provisioning times. The other part is dubbed Perfkit Explorer, a visualization tool that provides a series of dashboards and metrics to track performance across the cloud.\n\n+ ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Tim Cook explains what he really thinks of Android | Cloud giants do battle backed by distinctly different partner networks +\n\nThe source code for PerfKit is available under the Apache 2.0 license, and Google has pledged to keep the product relevant even as the cloud continues to evolve.\n\n\"PerfKit is a living benchmark framework, designed to evolve as cloud technology changes, always measuring the latest workloads so you can make informed decisions about what's best for your infrastructure needs,\" the announcement stated. \"As new design patterns, tools, and providers emerge, we'll adapt PerfKit to keep it current.\"\n\nThe genesis of the idea, according to Google, was the difficulty of comparing performance across different cloud platforms.\n\n\"It turns out that it's surprisingly difficult to evaluate cloud offerings beyond just looking at price or feature charts,\" the company said.\n\nPerfKit is a sign that Google has recognized the ongoing march of the cloud among enterprise customers, according to 451 Research analyst Jay Lyman.\n\n\"Now that more organizations are adopting cloud computing infrastructure, more of them are interested in measuring and optimizing performance, so Google's PerfKit is an effort to answer that demand,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, Lyman added, Google's own determination to make inroads among business customers may have helped push the project forward.\n\n\"[PerfKit] also comes at a time when Google is pushing harder into the enterprise and offering the kinds of features, functionality and assurances that enterprises expect, and this fits into that, too,\" he noted.\n\nThis story, \"Google's new open-source PerfKit framework watches cloud application performance\" was originally published by Network World.", "Waze is a community based traffic and navigation app that allows it users to pinpoint where police cars and speeding radar set-ups are currently located (among other things).

Some reports suggest it is likely that officers across the country are also doing the same thing in their local areas.\n\nWhile in most cases it just appears as though users are adding entries for others to avoid speeding tickets and things of that nature, U.S Sheriffs claim the issues could be much more severe than that. Waze, which is owned by Google, could apparently be used to stalk police officers, according to US law enforcement officials. However, many have suggested (including Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel) this claim likely doesn't hold much weight considering anyone going to do something like this wouldn't need Waze to do it.\n\nWaze feels its service just makes users drive more carefully then ever knowing that police officers are in the area.\n\nIt is hard to say how this feature and the roughly 50 million users Waze has actually effects road safety.

Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans.\n\nThere are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates.\n\n\"We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,\" said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.\n\nXiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts.\n\nA Xiaomi phone \"may not be the best product out there but a product with the best combination: a very affordable price and good quality,\" said Bing-Sheng Teng, a corporate strategy expert at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing.\n\nWhile the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out.\n\nBy concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot.\n\nBut executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here.\n\nIn addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying -- or at least closely imitating -- some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company.\n\nXiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed to this story.", "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is expected to announce an executive order directing the government and companies to share more information about cybersecurity threats in response to attacks like that on Sony Entertainment.\n\nAs in other policy areas where Obama has been unable to get legislation through the now Republican-controlled Congress, the White House is turning to more limited administrative actions to advance its agenda as much as it can.\n\nThe announcement could be tonight or tomorrow, when the U.S. president speaks at a daylong conference on cybersecurity at Stanford University in the heart of Silicon Valley, according to three participants in the conference.\n\nThe move comes as big Silicon Valley companies prove hesitant to fully support more mandated cybersecurity information sharing without reforms to government surveillance practices exposed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\n\"We are certainly hearing that an executive order may be announced,\" Nuala O'Connor, president of the technology lobbying group Center for Democracy & Technology, said as she boarded a plane en route to the event.\n\nA new government center for cybersecurity, announced earlier this week by Obama's top homeland security advisor, could play a key role in the process. But the Stanford attendees said they did not have details.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nCybersecurity industry veterans said Obama's anticipated order would be only a modest step in one of the president's major priorities - the defense of companies from attacks like those on Sony and Anthem Inc.\n\nAdministration officials have said they would prefer legislation that would require more information sharing and limit any legal liability for companies that share too much. They have said that an executive order could not limit liability.\n\nBut getting anything through Congress on the subject has proven a daunting task. That is unlikely to get much better without at least the support of big Silicon Valley companies such as Google Inc and Facebook Inc.\n\nThose companies, however, have refused to give full-throated support to cybersecurity bills without some reform of surveillance practices exposed by Snowden that have hurt U.S. technology companies' efforts to win business in other countries.\n\nNo grand bargain between the administration and the Valley companies has been reached, according to O'Connor and an executive at a major technology company.\n\nFor that reason, and the fact they have not seen the text of the planned executive order, top companies Google, Facebook and Yahoo are not sending their chief executives to the Stanford conference, the executive said. Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook is one of the few household names that is speaking, and that company declined to comment.\n\nIn a private meeting with Obama Friday, though, some of the leading executives are expected to press again for surveillance reform and support for strong encryption, which some in the administration have faulted recently on the grounds that it enables criminals and terrorists to hide their activity.\n\nBig technology companies and a host of startups have been beefing up encryption in Snowden's wake to make blanket intelligence collection overseas more difficult.", "The company will launch a phone accessory store later this year\n\nThe biggest Android smartphone maker most Americans have probably never heard of is taking its first step into the U.S. market.\n\nXiaomi, which in just four years has gone from nothing to leading the Chinese market, will launch a U.S. version of its online shopping site later this year but it won't sell the low-cost, high-spec phones for which the company has gained its reputation.\n\nInstead, it will sell a selection of phone accessories like battery packs and headphones. That doesn't mean a U.S. launch of its phones has been ruled out, however.\n\n\"The amount of effort to bring [smartphones and tablets] to market is significant,\" said Hugo Barra, the one-time Google executive who is now vice president for international markets at Xiaomi in Beijing. Barra, who was speaking to reporters in San Francisco, noted the various certifications required to sell products in each country, the need to strike deals with carriers and organize customer support.\n\n\"It's an incredible amount of work and we have to move at the right pace,\" he said. \"We're accelerating our entry by bringing simpler products.\"\n\nWhile Barra wouldn't commit to if or when Xiaomi will launch hardware, it appears to be on the company's mind. Thursday's event was held to introduce reporters to company executives and give them a chance to see Xiaomi handsets, many probably for the first time. The company also handed out samples of its MiNote 2 smartphone to some reporters and said it was keen to hear what they thought of the phone.\n\nIn China, the company has become a favorite among local users by continually seeking suggestions and improvements for its version of the Android operating system. Users vote on what features are added and every Friday at 5 p.m. local time, an update is published. This week marks the 225th weekly update.\n\nThe features include the functional, such as software detection of spam calls (a big problem in China), the useful, like shortcuts to popular items on the McDonald's China online phone ordering system, and frivolous ones such as cartoon skins for the phone's user interface.\n\nThe company also makes its own hardware. It releases a new phone roughly once a year, emphasizing quality and low price -- a formula that enabled it to beat Samsung to take the biggest share of the Chinese market in late 2014.\n\nThe company's overseas ambitions have so far been confined to Asian nations where price-conscious consumers buy phones outright rather than through carrier subsidies, and the road hasn't always been smooth.\n\nIn India, Xiaomi is embroiled in a patent dispute with Ericsson over wireless technology. On Thursday when asked if patent concerns were delaying a U.S. market entry, co-founder and President Bin Lin spoke of the number of patents it holds but didn't directly answer the question.\n\nThe company attributes a lot of its success to the support from its users, who it calls \"fans.\" Indeed, millions follow or support the company on social media and its message board buzzes with feedback and suggestions, but it remains to be seen if that formula can be translated to success in the U.S.\n\nMartyn Williams covers mobile telecoms, Silicon Valley and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

In its latest version, dubbed Lollipop, which has just started to roll out to older phones and tablets, the look and feel of Android and its primary apps get a major overhaul.\n\nGoogle calls the new look in Android 5.0 \"Material Design.\" It's marked by brighter colors, a \"flatter\" but layered look to applications and icons, and greater emphasis on clear and legible text.\n\nThe new design borrows ideas from the flat look that Apple introduced to its mobile operating system in iOS 7 and the interface Microsoft designed for its Windows Phone software. Android remains distinct from both, but it now appears to be in the same family.\n\nFor example, when you turn on Lollipop's new \"battery saver\" mode, the notification bar at the top of the screen and the taskbar at bottom turn a bright orange. The look is reminiscent of how the notification bar turns green in iOS when you are on a call or blue when you turn on its personal hotspot feature.\n\nSimilarly, many of the Google-designed apps in Lollipop have a unique color in their menu bars that serves to distinguish them from other apps. While Gmail's accent color is red, the one for the contacts app is blue.\n\nThe net result is an operating system that feels less like something designed by engineers for engineers and more like something that is lively, fun and accessible to non-techies.\n\nGoogle made some other design changes in Lollipop. One is to how Android displays open applications when you want to switch between them. In previous versions, when you pressed the \"overview\" button to see which applications you had running, Android would display a vertical list of thumbnail images of those programs. With Lollipop, Android displays them like a carousel, with the app windows stacked one on top of another. I prefer the new look, because it allows you to see more of the open apps at once.\n\nGoogle has also revamped the quick settings feature in Android. It's still available in the notifications area, but it's now accessible by swiping down twice from the top of the screen. It also includes some new settings, such as the ability to turn on a smartphone's hotspot feature or to turn on a device's flash to use it as a flashlight.\n\nTo be sure, Google did more in Lollipop than revamp Android's look. The updated software also includes lots of new features.\n\nAmong them are a greater amount of options and controls for notifications. Android users can now respond to alerts that display on their lock screen. They can turn on a privacy feature that allows notifications to be displayed on the lock screen, but blocks their content, such as the actual message in a text message. And they can turn on a mode that will only display alerts from particular people and apps.\n\nOne of the cool new features of Android is that it gives users more options in how to share their devices with others.\n\nAndroid tablets have been able to support multiple user accounts for a while now. With Lollipop, Android smartphones gain the same ability, allowing consumers to access their own contacts and other data on a friend or family member's phone. Lollipop also adds allows users to create guest accounts on both smartphones and tablets that can access any apps but none of the personal data on them.\n\nOf note for parents, the new software has a related feature that allows users to \"pin\" a particular app to the screen so that a child, say, can't use any other apps or see anything else on the device. That might be helpful if your kid wants to play a game on your phone, but you don't want them to see your email or reconfigure your homescreen.\n\nThese types of features -- support for multiple users and the ability to easily restrict access to younger users -- are ones that I've long wished Apple would build into iOS.\n\nGoogle has also enhanced the security in Android. In Lollipop, encryption is turned on by default; previously, it was hard to know that you could use it to protect your data, because to turn it on, you had to find it deep within the system's settings. While Android's ability for apps to work together fairly seamlessly was a selling point over iOS until recently, it's also been a vulnerability, potentially allowing malware to gain access to important functions on the device.\n\nIn Lollipop, Google limits the access particular programs have to the underlying functions; your apps should still be able to work together, but they should pose a lot less of a threat to functioning of your phone.\n\nAs with any new version of Android, the big questions for users are when they will be able to get the new software and the degree to which phone manufacturers will customize it. Although Lollipop has started to become available to certain Android devices, there are lots that still can't get it. When I tried several days ago to download it to two Android smartphones I've been testing -- Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge and Sharp's Aquos Crystal -- it wasn't available.\n\nMeanwhile, few electronics manufacturers offer an unadulterated Android experience. Unless you have one of Google's Nexus devices, you may not see many of the cool new interface features in Lollipop.\n\nOverall, Lollipop is a sweet new update. With both good looks and cool features, it's well worth downloading if you can get it.", "For the past week or so, I've been testing out a $199 HP Stream 11 laptop - perhaps the least expensive Windows laptop I've ever tried. What impressed me is that using it feels pretty much like using a standard laptop, not a crippled netbook of years past. It clearly isn't as powerful as more expensive notebook computers, but for people who primarily work with Web-based applications or documents and files that are stored in the cloud, it's a surprisingly nice alternative. (And the deal is even better if you like Microsoft Office 365 - it includes a one-year subscription to the Personal version, which can run on one PC, one tablet, and one phone and usually sells for about $70.)\n\nIn general, it feels like an alternative to a Chromebook, a system that runs Google's Chrome OS and is designed for Web applications with an emphasis on Google's own tools. Those have become very popular lately, particularly in education, so this class of machine has become Microsoft's way of competing. It runs \"Windows 8.1 with Bing\" which is effectively Windows 8.1 in which the default search engine in Internet Explorer is set to Bing (although you can change this, just as in other versions of Windows).\n\nAs the name implies, the Stream 11 has an 11.6-inch, 768-by-1,366-pixel display. It's not the brightest display I've seen, and I did notice some color variations when viewing it from an angle. And it certainly doesn't have a touch screen. In short, you can find a better screen pretty easily, but it's sufficient, and works fine when it's in front of you on a desk or in your lap.\n\nThe laptop runs on a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2840 processor, a dual-core version of the Bay Trail platform, and comes with 2GB of DRAM. In other words, it's pretty much an Atom processor, but with 64-bit processing, a burst frequency of 2.58GHz, and a TDP of 7.5 watts, which would be a lot for a phone but is much less than most notebook processors. It's not as fast as a Core processor - you wouldn't be happy running very complex models, high-end gaming, or sophisticated photo or video editing on this unit. (On my largest big data Excel spreadsheet, it took about 3.5 hours, compared with 83 minutes on a CoreM-based Yoga 3 Pro.)\n\nI did notice that it wasn't as snappy at loading Web pages as a higher-end system, and sometimes it took a second or two to get the whole page in. But everything did load, and I was able to open half a dozen tabs in the browser, including playing Internet video, without incident. The Office apps ran quite well - Word was just fine, and Excel ran smaller spreadsheets just fine- you'd be hard pressed to notice any difference in speed on any machine. Again, I've certainly used faster machines, but I was quite impressed by the speed for the money. This didn't feel like the old netbooks.\n\nTesting Internet streaming, I got about 6 hours of battery life with the screen at half brightness, which is good for a lightweight notebook.\n\nThere isn't much local storage - it has 32GB of flash storage, and after downloading Microsoft Office (again using the Office 365 bundle), I had only about 14GB left. (I've seen Chromebooks with less, but here you will be able to download applications, which will take some space.) It's clearly designed for people who will store their documents and files in the cloud, and Microsoft is hoping you will use its Office 365, which includes 1TB of OneDrive storage.\n\nAnd it felt good to carry around. It is available in blue or magenta, with a gradated color finish inside. The plastic is obvious, but it felt quite solid. It includes two full-size USB ports (one that supports USB 3.0), an SD card slot, and a full-size HDMI connector, along with Bluetooth and 802.11n Wi-Fi support (higher-end machines use the newer 802.11ac standard, but I didn't notice any real difference in typical use). The white keyboard stands out against the blue background nicely on the unit I used, although I would have preferred larger function keys (hard given the small size) and keyboard backlighting. It's not the best keyboard I've used, but I didn't expect it would be.\n\nAnd that pretty much sums up the Stream 11. Sure, it isn't as good as the higher-end laptops, but at this price, you don't expect it will be. Compared with an old netbook or even a new Chromebook, you get a lot more power and flexibility. (Chromebooks are simple, but designed for only Web applications. You can do all of that plus Windows applications on these low-end Windows devices.) I usually look at notebooks and phones that cost a lot more than this -- what impressed me the most was just how good a $199 device can be these days.", "Bank of England has now started monitoring what the British people are searching on the Internet and what they are sharing on social networks including Facebook and Twitter for collecting unconventional economic data.\n\nIt is reported special team has been set up by BoE to explore how the new data can help them in improving the picture of Britain's recovery. This will also help them in deciding whether to change interest rates.\n\nBoE chief economist Andy Haldane said analysis of the frequency of online prices searching and that of job may provide them with insights into inflation and unemployment.\n\nHe added further that such data will be better than official data as it could be more timely.

But an iOS flavor of the ubiquitous mail, calendar, and contact app seemed inevitable.\n\nAfter all, a Mac variation of Outlook has been available for years (alongside the original Windows version), and saw a big update in October (see \"Microsoft Outlook 15.3 for Mac,\" 2 November 2014). What's more, Microsoft in December snapped up tech startup Acompli, which had developed a mobile app for email, scheduling, contact management, and more.\n\nSure enough, Microsoft last month released upgraded iOS and Android versions of the Acompli app, but with a familiar name: Outlook. Both are free.\n\nThe new Outlook is being positioned as a no-brainer for those already invested in Office-type productivity, and as a highly integrated messaging, scheduling, and contact-management hub for those who don't want to juggle individual apps.\n\nMulti-service compatibility is another Outlook draw. It works with Google, Yahoo, and iCloud, along with Microsoft's Exchange ActiveSync and Outlook.com (but not generic IMAP accounts). Cloud-storage services Box, Dropbox, Google Drive and, of course, Microsoft's OneDrive are also along for the ride.\n\nIn a holdover from the Acompli period, Outlook has a streamlined interface with Mail, Calendar, Files, and People buttons (plus Settings) along the bottom for easily switching from mode to mode.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple's Mail, Calendar, and Contacts apps collectively do most of what Outlook does - and support one service, AOL, that Outlook doesn't - but there is something to be said for having all your information in one place. That has long been a Microsoft bragging point.\n\nMail -- Once a user's various email accounts have been set up, they're accessible in Outlook's Mail view via a menu that swoops in from the screen's left edge. That menu offers single-tap access to the inbox for each account, as well as a consolidated inbox, and account subfolders are available with another tap or two.\n\nMail can be filtered in a number of ways. Most notably, messages can be displayed in Focused and Other views, with the former option showing only important missives. Outlook had an initially flawed grasp of what that meant for me - spam made the cut in certain cases, alongside messages from my mother and my best friend - but the app learns over time. Separately, a Quick Filter menu narrows options to unread email, flagged emails, or messages with file attachments.\n\nOutlook has familiar Mailbox-style swiping gestures, which can be customized. By default, the app archives a message with a leftward swipe, and prompts to schedule a message to return to your inbox later with a rightward swipe. Either gesture can be reassigned to delete, move, flag or mark as read/unread. Pressing and holding a message listing opens a bulk-editing mode for selecting multiple messages.\n\nOne note about Gmail accounts: all such Google mail accounts worked properly when set up via IMAP in Outlook. Gmail accounts that are part of the paid Google Apps for Work service also support Exchange ActiveSync, but I couldn't set up my Google Apps account that way in Outlook even though I can do so in Apple Mail. I'm still trying to figure out why.\n\nYou can choose which account to send email from, and you can set a per-account signature, but for those who forward mail into Gmail, for instance, you cannot set an arbitrary return address.\n\nThat points out the most notable account-setup limitation: Outlook for iOS lacks an \"Other email\" option for generic IMAP accounts, which is odd since Outlook for Android does offer such a menu choice (with IMAP configuration options). Hopefully Microsoft will add this to the iOS version soon.\n\nCalendar -- As with email, Outlook consolidates calendars from various services, including Google, iCloud, and Yahoo, along with Outlook.com and Exchange ActiveSync.\n\nThe calendar function is otherwise predictable, with an agenda view, a week view, and a combination day and month view (tap the name of the month). Events can be assigned reminders, and setting up a meeting is simple enough. Calendar colors are customizable.\n\nNotably absent from the calendar lineup are Facebook events, which can be accessed using Apple's Calendar app, along with third-party apps like the Sunrise Calendar app (my default). In a related twist, Microsoft earlier this month acquired Sunrise, so Outlook might get a Facebook event infusion before long.\n\nFiles -- This Outlook view got my attention because hunting down files attached to email messages can be a pain. Now such files are shown in their own tidy lists corresponding to each mail service, along with file-storage services Box, Dropbox, and OneDrive. When I configured my Google account, Outlook also added my Google Drive.\n\nListed documents can't be edited within Outlook, but Microsoft gives each mail account the option of attaching files to outgoing messages, sharing them via whatever services the user has configured for that purpose, or saving them to any of the file-storage accounts. Files already in Box, Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive can be shared out or sent as attachments.\n\nFile management is one area Outlook shines in comparison to Apple Mail, which has no file-only view, and doesn't let you attach files from, or save files to, the likes of Box and Dropbox. I suspect many people will jump to Outlook for this reason alone.\n\nPeople -- Outlook's integrated approach carries over to the app's People view, which lists contacts from each service in its own tidy list, or in a consolidated multi-service view. It's easy to compose a new message to a person by tapping the pencil button next to that person's name.\n\nTap a person's name and Outlook shows pending meetings and recent file attachments associated with that person, along with recent messages (covering about the last four days). It would be nice if Outlook could expand the scope of the email search, but there's apparently no way to do that.\n\nBottom Line -- In the iOS realm, Outlook has entered a crowded field with dozens of mail and calendar apps jockeying with Apple's stock apps for user loyalty.\n\nBut Outlook stands out because it consolidates functions from a number of different apps into a single, simple-to-navigate interface, and because it assembles a variety of email and cloud storage services into an integrated information hub. Its file management features are another big plus.\n\nAs a result, Outlook seems destined to carve out a major slice of the iOS market on the strength of its name and undeniably useful features. It's free and easy to test, so if its features sound attractive, give it a try.", "The first Fonepad premiered in 2013, nearly a year after the game-changing Nexus 7, which Asus made for Google. The Taiwanese got another contract to work on an upgrade and they did well to keep the momentum. Padfones, Fonepads, Memo Pads and Zenfones were soon to join the Transformers in a lineup that's entirely indifferent to phones but offers an impressive variety of phablets and tablets.\n\nThe downside is it can get confusing. The original was simply called the Asus Fonepad. The Fonepad 7 succeeded it, followed by the Fonepad 7 (2104). At that point, Asus ran out of fresh naming ideas and the next generation has the model number in the official brand name. As a result, we're reviewing something a Fonepad 7 FE375CXG.\n\nAsus Fonepad 7 FE375CXG press images\n\nOK, a quick what's what in the Asus portfolio. Transformers are 10\" convertible tablets with a detachable keyboard.\n\nZenfones are tablets and Padfones hybrids: a phone and a docking station with a tablet-sized screen and battery.\n\nAnd finally, the compact tablets. These come in two flavors: Memo Pads are the household version of the Nexus, compact tablets with no voice call support. The Fonepads are the ones you can make network calls on.\n\nOne of the latest additions to the series, the Fonepad 7 FE375CXG is a dual-SIM compact tablet with expandable memory, front and rear cameras and stereo speakers. It's powered by an Intel chip - these are getting more powerful with each generation and yet manage to stay affordable. The one inside the Fonepad 7 is 22nm 64-bit chipset.\n\nThe Fonepad 7 FE375CXG appears bulky but it's not much thicker or heavier than most of its natural rivals. If you're after a tablet you can make calls on, Samsung's Galaxy Tabs are perhaps the most likely alternative. But if it has to have dual-SIM support, the competition is nearly non-existent.\n\nAsus Fonepad 7 FE375CXG live pictures\n\nThe Fonepad series are meant for the developing markets but should be easy to get via local retailers or official Asus distributors in Europe. Affordable, reasonably powered and capable of making calls on two SIM cards, the latest generation Fonepad 7 can get a lot of people interested.", "Twenty-nine years ago, when Congress considered the privacy to be afforded electronic communications, the concept of the Internet, text messaging and electronic storage of documents was still the stuff of science fiction.\n\nToday, 84 percent of U.S. households own a computer with access to the Internet, and 91 percent of Americans have a cellphone, according to Pew Research.\n\nThe media has been plastered with news of the data breach at Anthem were hackers stole names, Social Security numbers and other sensitive information from as many as 80 million customers. Americans are up in arms.\n\nYet few people know that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 makes private information -- emails, text messages and electronically stored documents -- available to\n\nlaw enforcement and the government six months after sent, received or stored.\n\nThe framers of the U.S. Constitution recognized that citizens in a democratic society have a reasonable expectation of privacy for their \"persons, houses, papers, and effects.\" However, today with a significant amount of \"papers and effects\" stored electronically, those protections secured more than two centuries ago have begun to erode.\n\nThe \"180-day rule,\" as it has become known, allows law enforcement officials to treat any emails, text messages or documents stored on remote servers -- popularly known as the\n\ncloud -- as \"abandoned\" if stored for more than 180 days, reported McClatchy.\n\nTraditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment as not providing privacy protection to property that has been abandoned. For instance, luggage at an airport that an individual refuses to claim or acknowledge ownership over -- or garbage that is set at the curb -- is considered abandoned and no longer afforded constitutional protection.\n\nCan the same be said for an eight-month old email or document stored in the cloud? The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 was written at a time when the breadth of electronic communication had not yet been fully contemplated.\n\nCongressman Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas, is leading an effort in the House of Representatives to update the law.\n\n\"They [police] couldn't kick down your door and seize the documents on your desk, but they could send a request to Google and ask for all the documents that are in your Gmail account. And I don't think Americans believe that the Constitution ends with the invention of the Internet,\" Yoder said in a statement.\n\nYoder's Bill has bipartisan support. He has partnered with Congressman Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat in the House and Senators Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIf passed into law, the legislation would protect the confidentiality of electronic communications described in the current law and prohibit the government from seeking or forcing disclosure of digital communication content without a warrant issued by \"a court of competent jurisdiction directing the disclosure.\"", "NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel and Google are trying to bring the 75-year-old View-Master into the 21st century -- with some help from smartphones and virtual reality technology.\n\nThe original View-Masters gave people a chance to click through colorful photos by inserting reels into the viewing devices.\n\nTargeted at families, the updated View-Master has users insert a smartphone into a headset. A smartphone app will enable the gadget to immerse kids in a slew of virtual worlds, from far-off cities to outer space. The new View-Masters will be priced at about $30.\n\nMattel and Google unveiled the virtual reality viewer Friday at Mattel's New York City office. The device launches in the fall, but the companies had no finished product to show off.\n\nBut Mattel demonstrated the technology using Google Cardboard, a cardboard attachment that turns smartphones into virtual reality viewers. Reels won't be necessary for the new View-Master, but they will enhance the experience. In a demo, there were reels for San Francisco, outer space and dinosaurs. Pointing your headset at one and clicking a button on the side of the headset took you into each of the worlds.

Cheese franchise where a customer one day brought Lee's elderly co-worker to tears, demanding a replacement birthday hostess who wasn't so old and didn't have a foreign accent.\n\n\"I had this 16-year-old sense of social justice, which led me to go out and have words with this mom,\" said Lee, who recalls telling her, \"Who do you think you are?\"\n\nNo one today is going to fire Lee for speaking the truth about Silicon Valley's dismal diversity problem, but she might have one of the hardest jobs in the industry: leveling a playing field that is heavily skewed against women, African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nLee had been working at Google since 2006, mostly as an employment attorney, before the company tapped her in 2013 to set out a strategy and agenda for improving workforce diversity. The first step, she said, was understanding it.\n\nAfter fighting a 2010 attempt by this newspaper to disclose the racial and gender breakdown of its employees, Google last year became the first big tech company to come clean about the demographics of its tech workforce: 83 percent male, and only 2 percent Latino and 1 percent black.\n\nAbout one year ago, Lee rolled out training on how unconscious bias can seep into the workplace. More than 26,000 employees have participated in the voluntary lectures and the philosophy is now baked into how workers are hired and evaluated. She's also pushed Google to spend more time recruiting at historically black colleges and universities, and improve the experience under-represented workers have when they get to campus.\n\nLee sat down near her office recently to talk about her job. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ There are people in Silicon Valley who say the lack of women, the lack of black and Latino tech workers, is a pipeline problem, essentially faulting U.S. society at large and the education system for the poor numbers. Is that a cop-out? Is it partly true?\n\nA It's partly true. I don't think I would necessarily assign blame to our education system or overarching societal issues. The tech industry obviously has a role to play. But particularly for women, there is a very serious pipeline issue.\n\nWe know this because women are now the majority of college grads and yet when it comes to computer science degrees, an important one for Google, only 18 percent are women. In the 1980s, when computer science was becoming a big thing, that number was much higher, at 38 percent. You've seen a precipitous decline where women are no longer interested in pursuing the field.\n\nFor other under-represented minorities, it's a different issue. Their representation on college campuses is too low. There's an educational access and opportunity gap.\n\nQ What was the impetus (for Google) to take more action?\n\nA I think we got to a point as a company where we were sufficiently big and thought we ought to take stock of exactly what we looked like. We had been growing by leaps and bounds, just trying to find the best talent, leveraging employee referrals, which are a really prominent source of leads for us to build a workforce. We didn't pause and examine what that was producing in terms of workforce demographics. When we did that in 2013, we were concerned we had arrived at a place we hadn't aspired to be.\n\nQ Was Google's dependence on employee referrals and networks working against diversity?\n\nA We don't know the answer to that, but I think it's fair to surmise that if we're (recruiting) in the same places all the time, like the most elite colleges in the country, the result is going to be more homogenous than we'd like it to be. And if you rely on people to refer people they know, who tend to look like them and share a similar background, you're also going to produce sameness. Much of what we're doing to change the composition of our workforce is to cast a much wider net for talent.\n\nQ What explains the drop in women studying computer science?\n\nA We commissioned original research that revealed it's primarily parents' encouragement, and perception, and access. Parents don't see their young girls as wanting to pursue computer science and don't steer them in that direction. There's this perception that coding and computer science is really geeky, that it's a \"brogrammer\" culture, for boys, for games, for competition. There hasn't been enough emphasis on the power computing has in achieving social impact. That's what girls are interested in. They want to do things that matter.\n\nQ What has been Google employees' reaction to your work?\n\nA When I first got into the role in early 2013, the first step was to understand our workforce demographics. We did a major push internally (for employees to self-identify by race and gender on forms). Step two was to tell them about it, because you can't ask Googlers for a bunch of information and not tell them. When we reported it to Googlers, about a year before we reported it publicly, I think there was a sigh of relief that we pulled the curtain back and were willing to expose what we weren't very proud of.\n\nQ Thousands of new Googlers have been hired since you publicly revealed the numbers in May. Are we going to see a significant change this year?\n\nA It's going to take a long time. I'm certainly not satisfied. We believe we have a deeper understanding of some of the root causes, but we don't have the solutions all figured out. Google's strength is that we're data-driven and analytical. Our approach, hopefully, will be a byproduct of good solid research and deliberation. When we publish numbers again (probably in June), I would anticipate no one's going to be wowed. It's going to take a deep and sustained commitment, which we're absolutely committed to, to see real meaningful change.", "JACKSON, Miss. -- Does Google help criminals by allowing its search engine to lead to pirated music or by having its autocomplete function suggest illegal activities?\n\nMississippi's attorney general suspects the company does and wants to investigate further, yet the Internet giant says companies aren't liable for what people say and do online.\n\nThe Mountain View-based company says Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood is infringing on its free speech rights. The company wants U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate to issue an injunction saying it doesn't have to answer a subpoena from Hood, and wants the judge to bar the attorney general from filing civil or criminal charges.\n\nLawyer Peter Neiman told Wingate during a three-hour hearing Friday that Hood, indirectly though his investigation, is trying to give states the power to filter the Internet.\n\n\"They're trying to cloak themselves in 'Let's make the Internet safer,'\" Neiman said.\n\nThe Democratic attorney general, though, says Google profits off illegal activity through its own conduct.\n\nThe showdown between Google and Hood escalated last fall when Hood sent a 79-page subpoena to Google. That document demands the company produce information on whether Google is helping criminals by allowing its search engine to lead to pirated music, having its autocomplete function suggest illegal activities and sharing YouTube ad revenue with the makers of videos promoting illegal drug sales.\n\nThe judge said he will rule Feb. 24.\n\nGoogle contends that Congress made it immune from Hood's investigation when it passed the Communications Decency Act in 1996. That law says Internet service providers aren't responsible for content provided by others. Neiman said everything Hood has cited is third-party content.\n\n\"There are real, concrete things that Google did to change its constitutionally protected editorial judgment to try to mollify the attorney general,\" he said, saying the company changed its autocomplete filter and began limiting ads on some YouTube videos.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Doug Miracle said federal law does not make Google immune from investigation. The law might be a defense against a lawsuit, he said, but Hood has filed no such suit and is still trying to determine facts.\n\n\"They're asking the court to tell the attorney general he cannot investigate,\" Miracle told Wingate.\n\nThe state lawyer denied that Hood was \"chilling\" Google's speech rights.\n\n\"The only thing that would be chilled would be the attorney general's ability to enforce the consumer protection laws,\" Miracle said.\n\nGoogle and supporters say Hood is part of a covert campaign by movie studios to use legal action to achieve enhanced piracy protection that Congress has rejected. Neiman pointed to a letter that Hood sent Google that was largely drafted by the Motion Picture Association of America, as well as the hiring of former Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore by the Digital Citizens Alliance, a nonprofit group funded by movie studios and other companies.\n\nMiracle said that Neiman's discussion of the movie industry was a \"real red herring\" and said Hood was only working with crime victims.\n\n\"He's going to work with the people and the industries who are affected by the problem,\" Miracle said.", "PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Declaring that the Internet has become the \"Wild Wild West\" with consumers and industries as top targets, President Obama on Friday called for a new era of cooperation between the government and the private sector to defeat a range of fast-evolving online threats.\n\nMr. Obama signed an executive order urging companies to join information-sharing hubs to exchange data on online threats -- and, in some cases, to receive classified information from the government. But the order stopped short of exempting the companies from liability if the data they collected and shared led to legal action.\n\nOnly legislation, which Mr. Obama has tried and failed to get through Congress for three years, can exempt the companies from such liability. Many companies outside the financial industry have been reluctant to share data without such a law in place.\n\nMr. Obama deliberately chose Stanford University as the site of its first summit meeting on online security and consumer protection, saying that it was where much of the Internet was born and is also where the innovations to secure it must be developed.\n\n\"The very technologies that can empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and do great harm,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nMr. Obama also made clear that his six years of presidency have given him new appreciation of how the government will be called upon to protect citizens against the most severe attacks, and once again accused North Korea of hacking into Sony Pictures. \"The cyberworld is the Wild Wild West -- to some degree we're asked to be the sheriff,\" he said. \"When something like Sony happens, people want to know what the government can do about this.\"\n\nMr. Obama arrived in the heart of Silicon Valley at a time of great tension with companies here, including Apple and Google, both represented at the event. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was seated to Mr. Obama's left Friday afternoon at a closed-door lunch meeting with senior executives, only months after coming into direct conflict with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence agencies over the full encryption of its mobile devices. Mr. Obama's intelligence and law enforcement aides would like to preserve access to all digital communication with a court order. The companies say that would create a breach that China and Russia, among others, would exploit.\n\nMr. Cook, who was invited to the meeting to discuss Apple's new payment system, Apple Pay, used the occasion to urge government and technology leaders to do everything they can to protect users' rights to privacy and security.\n\n\"People have entrusted us with their most personal and precious information,\" Mr. Cook said. \"We owe them nothing less than the best protections that we can possibly provide.\"\n\nFailing to do so, Mr. Cook said, would \"risk our way of life.\"\n\nThe private sector has largely been reluctant to share information about threats with the government, arguing that it would create onerous regulations and potentially compromise proprietary and customer data.\n\nJoseph M. Demarest Jr., assistant director of the F.B.I.'s cyberdivision, said in an interview that given the sophistication of the hackers American companies are up against, information-sharing had proved critical to tracing attacks back to hackers and ridding them from systems.\n\n\"We're fighting Ph.D.s on the other side of the world,\" Mr. Demarest said. \"Not only the F.B.I., but our colleagues from the intelligence community, can enable and assist not only with attribution but with kicking actors out and keeping them out.\"\n\nAfter the Sony attacks late last year, Mr. Demarest said the F.B.I.'s presence at Sony's headquarters was crucial in helping the bureau and the government trace the attacks back to North Korea.\n\n\"Companies are realizing there is a benefit to keeping us involved,\" he said.\n\nBusinesses reeling from the fallout from the revelations about online surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden also worry about the impression such sharing would create among customers. Foreign governments are worried that such arrangements will compromise their data.\n\nPrivacy activists say the approach is misguided. \"Key to security is to minimize data collection and adopt robust security measures,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"If they can't protect it, they shouldn't collect it.\"\n\nBut few of those tensions were on display on Friday, as Mr. Obama, government officials and a carefully curated list of executives from the technology, banking, energy and health care sectors took the stage to speak for the need for greater public-private partnership in combating online threats.\n\n\"This work cannot be adversarial; we have enough adversaries out there,\" Anthony Earley Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas & Electric, said on stage Friday.\n\nMany companies point out that they already share information with others in their industries through industry-specific instruments, notably the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a group that shares threats with members of the banking industry.\n\nAnd companies have been particularly reluctant, after the Snowden revelations, to do anything to aggravate concerns abroad that they are sharing data on foreigners with intelligence agencies.\n\nTo assuage those concerns, Bernard Tyson, the chairman of Kaiser Permanente, tried to distinguish the kinds of data his corporation would share with the government.\n\n\"I am not talking about sharing the actual content that I am here to protect,\" Mr. Tyson said. \"It is sharing what I am learning about people trying to get at that content. It's important for me to say that because that is the sensitivity I hear every day.\"\n\nNot mentioned at the event was the issue that has most roiled companies in Silicon Valley. Disclosures by Mr. Snowden showed that intelligence agencies were surreptitiously siphoning off customer data from companies like Google and Yahoo as it flowed internally between their data centers.\n\nThat information created an atmosphere of distrust that executives say will make information-sharing much more difficult.\n\n\"The tricky thing with information-sharing is that it is about trust,\" Eric Grosse, Google's vice president of security, said in an interview earlier this week. \"Information-sharing becomes pretty hard to do once trust is lost.\"\n\nMr. Grosse and others conceded that in extreme situations they would provide critical data to law enforcement, such as an impending problem with an aircraft carrier. \"When it's serious, we will do the right thing.\" But the government, Mr. Grosse said, \"can't cry wolf.\"", "Lola Masha's toothy smile makes her more beautiful. But beyond the fine face is the dogged and fiercely independent business leader. This graduate of Chemical Engineering is the country leader and manager of OLX, one of Nigeria's thriving online business platforms. The mother-of- one honed her business and administrative skills in various companies like Google and Bank PHB. She later moved into consultancy till early 2014 when OLX spotted her and got her on board to lead its firm in Nigeria. And together with her team, Mrs. Marsha was poised to push online marketing outfit. She spoke with Vera Wisdom-Bassey on issues that border on the prospect of online business, life as a business leader and other matters.\n\nExcerpt...\n\nW\n\nhy did you delve into online business instead of being a chemical engineer that you studied in school?\n\nI tell people not to be too focused on things they should be doing. Rather they should just do what they enjoy, and know that there is no learning that is transferable. I've also been into consultancy and I have even worked in banking. The key thing is to do your best, to move the business forward.\n\nSo, what is OLX all about?\n\nOLX stands for an On Line Exchange. So far, the journey has been so good. I have been at OLX for a year, and the business has grown tremendously in terms of number of users. And we look forward to even establishing and cementing our vision of being number one online transacter.\n\nThe key thing that stands us out is that we are creating a business environment, where individuals can use our online platform to convert items like furniture, toys, electronics to cash. There are lots of stories that have really touched our hearts. There's this story of a guy who got a visa to travel outside the country, but do not have the money for the flight ticket. But he was able to raise money by selling some household items through our website. He sold his used car, I-pad and some other items before he secured enough money to purchase a ticket.\n\nHow do you manage this brand in the face of the fierce competition from other online business platforms in the country today?\n\nThe important thing is the method, need and service that you provide. What OLX provides is a platform for individuals to trade. Trade has existed since the beginning of time, where users buy and sell among each other, what OLX is doing is giving you the online platform and website that allows you to do that. Other website only sell brand new items, but OLX is one of the websites where people can sell used items like car, utensils, etc.\n\nWhat does it take to market items on an online business platform like OLX?\n\nIs a very simple process, all you have to do is to take pictures of the items you want to sell, list the price and description of those items, then you post it. Our teams at OLX will reveal those items to see if it meets our quality before it goes online for sale. OLX does not fix the price, it is the seller or owner of the item that fixes the price the item would be sold online.\n\nHow would you rate the prospects of online business in Nigeria?\n\nThe potentials of the online world are tremendous. I have no doubt about it. We have seen several countries grow in the last few years. If you look at some countries outside Nigeria, you'll realise that they have recorded immense growth in their economy, because their populace tap into the internet. I see that trend happening in Nigeria as well, because we are partnering to increase internet penetration.\n\nThere are many advantages to doing business online. Nigeria's huge population implies access to a huge customer base. Also, online businesses allow one to fulfil your needs and wants wherever you are and whenever you want to. The boundaries are truly limitless as long as innovation and customer satisfaction are the guiding values.\n\nE-commerce is capable of changing people's lives for the better in Nigeria. Not only are online companies employing large numbers of people, e-commerce also allows people to make an honest living where previously there have been few options.\n\nAs infrastructure get better and the population becomes savvier, e-commerce is going to play a huge role in growing the economy and giving the average man more access to wealth.\n\nHow would you advise individuals that aspire to tap into online businesses?\n\nThe key thing is having clarity on the exact business module of what you're trying to achieve. Ensure you don't get distracted, but focus on the business module. Endeavour to test and try it out before you set up your online business. Then constantly try to evolve the business, with the idea, and make sure it works.\n\nBut do you think Nigeria is right for this internet market?\n\nAbsolutely, I think it's much easier to be successful doing businesses online rather than off line. It requires less structure and less capital to get your business going. All you need is your connector, a laptop and some lectures on how to use the website. Off line business requires, maybe a shop and hiring people to assist build up a business.\n\nThen continuously learn how to use the twitter, find ways to grow your expertise, how to effectively use new tools in technology. And then get started, and once you do, keep at it and keep finding ways to manage it and grow it.\n\nHow do you manage your time, as a mother, career person and wife?\n\nThe key thing is to provide staff members with an empowering environment where they can work freely. Then delegating some duties and making sure every staffer does his/her job well. We normally have a very brainy and stormy session, where we address our common challenges to ensure we promote the right culture within OLX. And to make it where other people would aspire to come and work.\n\nAlso, I have a very supportive and understanding husband. In addition, the business allows me to properly balance my career and family. So, if I need to leave early for any family emergency the work allows me to do that. We encourage and want to provide a working environment that supports women and men to balance their family lives in the work places.\n\n23 yrs boy started importation with N10,450.

And now, the marriage is official because Mattel and Google are partnering to make just that: A Google Cardboard-powered View-Master.\n\nBecause the new View-Master is basically just a phone-powered VR headset just like Google's cardboard headsets or even Gear VR, there's no room for you to slot the old, iconic View-Master reels into this thing. They're still around though! Instead of loading them up in the headset, you just place them on the table and look at them through the View-Master (using the View-Master app), and you'll see graphics popping up out of them.\n\nView-Master refers to the reels as \"experience disks,\" which will function sort of like physical representations of the various special View-Master specific apps you have. You'll be able to use the View-Master without any of the special disks of course, as you would any other Google Cardboard-powered headsets, but View-Master's specific, family-friendly apps will come in the form of the reels.\n\nThe new View-Master has a few advantages over other Cardboard-powered headsets that are out there. Mattel insists -- without a super clear explanation -- that it will support phones of all sizes and operating systems, presumably through a View-Master app that will appear on iOS, in addition to all the Google Cardboard stuff you're able to find on Android.\n\nThe new View-Master will be available in late 2015. It has an approximate release date of October and an approximate price of $US30 for the headset and one experience disk.\n\nHave you subscribed to Gizmodo Australia's email newsletter?

Americans are up in arms.\n\nYet few people know that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 makes private information -- emails, text messages and electronically stored documents -- available to\n\nlaw enforcement and the government six months after sent, received or stored.\n\nThe framers of the U.S. Constitution recognized that citizens in a democratic society have a reasonable expectation of privacy for their \"persons, houses, papers, and effects.\" However, today with a significant amount of \"papers and effects\" stored electronically, those protections secured more than two centuries ago have begun to erode.\n\nThe \"180-day rule,\" as it has become known, allows law enforcement officials to treat any emails, text messages or documents stored on remote servers -- popularly known as the\n\ncloud -- as \"abandoned\" if stored for more than 180 days, reported McClatchy.\n\nTraditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment as not providing privacy protection to property that has been abandoned. For instance, luggage at an airport that an individual refuses to claim or acknowledge ownership over -- or garbage that is set at the curb -- is considered abandoned and no longer afforded constitutional protection.\n\nCan the same be said for an eight-month old email or document stored in the cloud? The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 was written at a time when the breadth of electronic communication had not yet been fully contemplated.\n\nCongressman Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas, is leading an effort in the House of Representatives to update the law.\n\n\"They [police] couldn't kick down your door and seize the documents on your desk, but they could send a request to Google and ask for all the documents that are in your Gmail account. And I don't think Americans believe that the Constitution ends with the invention of the Internet,\" Yoder said in a statement.\n\nYoder's Bill has bipartisan support. He has partnered with Congressman Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat in the House and Senators Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIf passed into law, the legislation would protect the confidentiality of electronic communications described in the current law and prohibit the government from seeking or forcing disclosure of digital communication content without a warrant issued by \"a court of competent jurisdiction directing the disclosure.\"", "Founded in 1971 as an avant-garde dance company by Dartmouth College students, Pilobolus has become an international entertainment brand featured on the likes of Oprah, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Academy Awards.\n\nPilobolus is renowned worldwide for its witty dance and acrobatics, using the human body as a medium of expression.

Reels won't be necessary for the new View-Master, but they will enhance the experience. In a demo, there were reels for San Francisco, outer space and dinosaurs. Pointing your headset at one and clicking a button on the side of the headset took you into each of the worlds. A set of four reels will cost $15.\n\nThe original View-Master launched at the New York World's Fair in 1939. Mattel says it has sold more than 100 million of them.\n\nThe new version will launch on Android devices first, but the companies plan to make it available on all platforms down the line.", "Britain's Business Secretary Vince Cable poses in a prototype driverless car called a LUTZ (Low-carbon Urban Transport Zone) Pathfinder Pod during a launch event for the media near the O2 Arena in London.\n\nDRIVERLESS CARS are hitting Britain's public roads for the first time, giving a glimpse of future travel that's billed as safer and more efficient.\n\nBritain unveiled four prototype self-drive cars Wednesday, launching the country's first public trials ahead of a series of planned rule reviews to accommodate the new technology.\n\nOfficials showed off four types of autonomous vehicles under trial, including a shuttle that looks like a larger golf cart and a compact two-seater \"pod.\" Journalists were invited to take short rides on the shuttle, which zipped around a public square outside central London's O2 Arena as curious pedestrians looked on.\n\nThe project was \"still in the early days,\" Transport Minister Claire Perry said, but she added the new technology has the potential to make roads safer and attract global investment.\n\nBritain has ambitions to lead development in driverless cars, which are also being tested in US cities by companies including Google. Auto companies from Mercedes-Benz to Nissan are also developing self-drive vehicles, though most are not ready to go on public roads and highways commercially.\n\nRegulation and legal changes are a major hurdle. Officials say fully driverless cars are unlikely to be used on British roads until 2030.\n\nBritain's government, which is spending \u00a319m on four trial centers around the country, says it will amend and review domestic road regulations by 2017. One focus will be on establishing liability when a self-drive car crashes.\n\n\"Until that key concern is clarified, probably by statute, many drivers will remain wary of 'driverless' driving,\" said Edmund King, president of drivers' organization AA.\n\nThe next immediate step is for officials to publish guidelines for companies to test the cars in \"real-life scenarios\" on roads -- including highways -- by this summer. Qualified drivers will be riding in the cars, ready to take control should anything go awry.", "I remember the first time I found out Jack Rogers sandals were a must-have for Hilton Head Island High School girls. A friend pointed them out to me and said \"They're like $140. Everyone has them.\"\n\nSure enough, the more I looked around, the more I saw them everywhere. Those hideous sandals that make the wearer's toes look like fat chunks of marzipan -- shoes that I thought had to be from a Carnival cruise ship gift shop -- were the current cornerstone of teenage mimicry.\n\nIt made me sad. Don't they want to be different from each other? Where's their spirit of individuality? \"Jacks\"? Really?\n\nNot that I should talk. My own trunk of sheep's clothing included L.L. Bean Blucher Mocs in junior high. I still can't believe I begged for those. If you Google it, you will very clearly see that this is a shoe for a casual man and not for a 13-year-old girl who \"designed\" her own nail polish colors. But it was the price of admission back then -- the way I let my friends know that I was one of them, or as \"one of them\" as I could muster with my messy hair and braces from the War Criminal Collection.\n\nWe were a tribe. Just look at our feet.\n\n\"Girls use clothes, accessories and fashion to define themselves, make statements about their choice of peer group, and to establish their psychological identities,\" Dr. Stephanie Newman wrote in a 2010 article from Psychology Today on why teenage girls dress alike. \"For some, the right outfit can serve as a conduit to the popular clique. For others, clothing choice allows them to fly under the radar.\"\n\nIt doesn't end at prom either.\n\nRecently, I was waiting for a table at B. Matthew's in Savannah when the most amazing thing happened: A group of seven women in their 20s materialized, all wearing variations of the Southern Girl Uniform, that horse stall chic ensemble of jeans or leggings, boots, a peek of boot sock perhaps, plaid shirt, quilted vest or cardigan, with Ray-Bans, Michael Kors or Marc by Marc Jacobs purse -- maybe a crossbody -- and long, straight, glossy hair, sometimes with loose curls. I usually see it happen in ones and twos, especially in Bluffton or Charleston. But never like this. I felt like a photographer from National Geographic trying not to startle the wildlife.\n\nI snapped a few secret photos and imagined a cacophony of seven internal monologues, each judging the next for stealing her look: \"Why is she copying me?\" \"Why is she such a copier?\" \"Oh my God. Follower!\" \"She should've changed when she saw me ... well, when she saw me and her and her and her and her.\"\n\nThe truth, though, is that they likely didn't care or even notice they were dressed so similarly.\n\nDutch photographer Hans Eijkelboom's recently released book \"People of the Twenty-First Century,\" is, as his publisher calls it, \"an enormous and completely fascinating collection of 'anti-sartorial' photographs of street life.\" Page after page shows human beings' uncanny knack for unintentionally dressing alike, something New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham has made a career out of documenting in his daily search for trends. We fight for individualism and personal style yet we feel safest when we're visually seamless with a crowd.\n\nIt feels depressing. Every look belongs to a larger catalog. We sort and choose and judge and procreate accordingly. Are there any true trendsetters?\n\nThe first person who came to mind is Tavi Gevinson, the wunderkind fashion blogger who caught the attention of Anna Wintour at age 12. Now 18, Gevinson runs online magazine Rookie, the perfect place for individualistic girls to gather and express themselves.\n\nBut here's what I found: Even those with a strong sense of self seek like-minded souls, as evidenced by this delightful commenter: \"I told someone the other day that my clothing inspirations were old men, flappers, hobos, various female punk-rockers, and Marie Antoinette ... I wish I had a girl gang to match with.\"\n\nYou know what? I don't doubt she'll find one.", "Posted 7 hours ago by iClarified | Please help us and submit a translation by clicking here | 4253 views\n\nApple has several hundred employees secretly building an electric car. The project is codenamed 'Titan' and the vehicle's initial design resembles a minivan, reports the WSJ.\n\nThe size of the project team and some of the people assigned to it indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook reportedly approved the project nearly a year ago and assigned VP Steve Zadesky to lead the group. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the teams that built the iPod and iPhone. He was given the go ahead to create a 1,000 person team and poach employees from different parts of Apple.\n\nThe team is said to work at a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino. It's researching different types of robotics, metals, and materials consistent with manufacturing a vehicle, say sources.\n\nWhile manufacturing a vehicle is typically very expensive, this would not be an issue for Apple who has nearly $180 billion in cash. A single manufacturing plant is said to cost over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce over 10,000 components.\n\nThe WSJ's report corroborates another recent report from the Financial Times that revealed Apple has been hiring experts in vehicle design and automotive technology to work in a secret research lab.\n\nAccording to a source, Apple is not working on a self-driving car to compete with Google; rather, it's looking to build an electric car that will rival Tesla and other car manufacturers.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nHit the link below for more details...\n\nRead More\n\n[Concept]", "If you grew up from the 1960s through the 1980s, chances are you or someone you knew had a distinctive red image viewer and a stack of flimsy cardboard reels. The classic View-Master reels could depict scenery, movies, TV shows, or any other visual content in stereoscopic 3D, with some models even incorporating an audio track. Now, Mattel has announced a partnership with Google to bring a Carboard version of the View-Master to life with 3D animated reels that introduce kids to the concept of VR.\n\nThe new View-Master will be available for roughly $30, new \"reels\" of content will cost roughly $15 in packs of four and offer a new VR experience that's tailor-made for children. The device won't be wearable, as such -- it'll maintain the interactive elements that've made the View-Master option unique, with application availability across Android, iOS, and Windows. The device will apparently fit most smartphones (compatibility has yet to be detailed) and uses an uprated version of Google Cardboard made from plastic. Content can apparently be purchased in plastic reels or downloaded via the application (exactly how this works hasn't been disclosed yet).\n\nThe Verge wasn't impressed with the initial run of viewer apps, claiming that the environments look like crude video games and that the informative captions \"don't do much to help.\" The photos are getting better ratings, and the entire idea of updating a physical, reel-based system is both nostalgic for existing adults and possibly a cool idea for kids as well, if the content can be brought up to snuff.\n\nOne issue that the Verge brings up indirectly in its coverage is the simple fact that VR content will live and die on the strength of its material. This has been brought up in coverage at Ars Technica and from time to time in other areas -- gaming that wants to include VR options have to be explicitly designed for it. Standard video effects that work perfectly well on a monitor aren't well suited to a head-mounted display.\n\nDone properly, Mattel's View-Master could be an amazing toy that blends old-school physical hardware with brand-new content in resolutions and quality levels that children in the 1960s could only dream of. If the content is lackluster, however, the Mattel View-Master will go down as a failed kludge -- a device that tried to bridge the gap between real-world toys and virtual entertainment and fell squarely into the hole instead.", "Apple chief executive Tim Cook has warned that there will be \"dire consequences\" if technology companies do not protect the privacy of their users.\n\nMr Cook was the only technology executive to attend a White House cybersecurity summit at Stanford University after Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Yahoo's Marissa Mayer and Google's Larry Page skipped the event amid growing concerns about US government surveillance.\n\nPresident Obama also spoke at the summit in Silicon Valley at a time when his administration's relationship with web giants has grown frosty over government spying tactics.\n\n\"History has shown us that sacrificing our right to privacy can have dire consequences,\" Cook said in a speech.\n\n\"We still live in a world where all people are not treated equally, too many people do not feel free to practice their religion or express their opinion or love who they choose - a world in which that information can make the difference between life and death.\n\n\"If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money. We risk our way of life.\n\n\"Fortunately, technology gives us the tools to avoid these risks. It is my sincere hope that by using them and by working together, we will\", the Apple boss said.\n\nThe Apple boss also used 12 minute speech to take a swipe at rivals Google and Facebook whose business models are largely based on personal data they collect about their users.\n\n\"We have a business model that focuses on selling the best products and services in the world, not on selling your personal data,\" Cook said.\n\nCook said that he was committed to \"working productively\" with the government and even used the summit to announce that Apple's mobile payment service would soon be used on government transactions including linking to social security and veterans benefits.\n\nMeanwhile President Obama followed Cook's impassioned speech by warning that cyber attacks were a threat to America's economic security.\n\n\"Grappling with how the government protects the American people from adverse events while at the same time making sure that government itself is not abusing its capabilities is hard,\" Obama said. \"The cyber world is sort of the wild, Wild West, and to some degree we're asked to be the sheriff.\"\n\nThe American president joked that before he became educated on cyber security \"password\" and \"1234567\" used to be his security codes.\n\nObama finished his speech by signing an Executive Order that encourages and promotes sharing of cybersecurity threat information within the private sector and between corporates and the federal government.", "Forget UV sensors and heart rate monitors on your gadgets, what about something that can do much, much, more? Researchers at Columbia University recently created a device that could cost as low as $34 but can accurately test for syphilis and HIV, providing results to the user within just 15 minutes. Something so simple and private could help save lives.\n\nThe attachment, 10 years in the making, is large and far from svelte, but it can easily pop into an iPhone's headphone jack and analyze a blood sample quickly. A user will have to prick his or her self first, and then insert that blood test into the device, The Washington Post said.\n\nThen, the iPhone's processor and special software can determine whether or not a user is infected with syphilis or HIV. \"The new device essentially replicates the HIV test considered a gold standard for laboratory testing, as well as the same kind of syphilis tests you might get in a standard laboratory,\" The Washington Post explained. The device made its debut in a new paper published in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nThe health gadget was created by Columbia Univeristy associate professor of biomedical engineering Samuel Sia and his team, and Sia hopes that it might one day be available for consumers to purchase, especially since the whole set-up costs around $34 to build (plus a small fee, under $2, for the tabs to insert into the device for analysis).\n\n\"If you can start to bring core health services to the smartphone beyond just measuring the heart rate -- like blood tests -- then you're going to start seeing a pretty fundamental shift in the health care system,\" he said.

It would also offer protection from liability for the sharing of cyber threats under certain guidelines.\n\nAlthough the order lacks the liability protection which could be afforded in legislation for information sharing, a White House statement said the measure \"paves the way for new legislation\" by establishing a framework for private-sector information sharing networks. -- AFP", "PALO ALTO, Calif.

And he signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for private firms to have access to classified information about cyber attacks.\n\nHe also stressed there would be oversight to ensure protections for privacy and civil liberties.\n\nPartnering with the federal government is a hard sell in the Silicon Valley. The pace of innovation in California's tech hub outstrips the Beltway bureaucracy, and tech firms chafe at regulations that could limit their reach. Further, disclosures from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden exposing sweeping U.S. government surveillance programs that tapped into data from firms including Google and Yahoo have angered many.\n\n\"The new proposals face significant headwinds, both legislatively from Congress and cooperatively from heavyweights in the tech sector,\" said Ben Desjardins, director of security solutions at cybersecurity firm Radware. \"Based on the Snowden leaks, these companies believe they've already been badly burned by the government, and have very little to gain by publicly backing the president's proposals.\"\n\nNonetheless, there was agreement at the daylong summit among White House officials and leaders from a broad business sector -- including utilities, health care, insurance and finance -- that the threat is getting worse, and no single institution can take it on.\n\n\"I don't think any of us spend enough on this.

History has shown us that sacrificing our right to privacy can have dire consequences,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook, who described the online world as being in a pivotal moment. \"If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money.

The reaction was magical and immediate. And as a result, Google has expanded its platform and hired even more virtual reality makers to join their team.\n\nBrands and agencies have taken note of Cardboard too, because they recognize it as an entr\u00e9e into the next generation of storytelling mediums. The passion for connecting with users in unique, innovative ways has given rise to new marketing and experiential activations that take advantage of smartphone-based virtual reality.\n\nMike Woods, Global Executive Creative Director and Head of Framestore's VR studio, advises, \"The first step is not to shoehorn any kind of existing thoughts or content into VR. VR is a very natural thing. It's not a camera, it's a person. So here's your opportunity to put customers inside your brand.\"\n\nScott Broock, Vice President of VR Content at Jaunt adds, \"In terms of an experience that can transport someone in a completely unique new way, there is nothing like this.\" Last month, Jaunt VR partnered with Elle magazine to bring readers onto the set of a photo shoot with Jacquie Lee, the acclaimed singer from NBC's The Voice. Kevin O'Malley, Senior Vice President and Publisher of Elle Magazine, added, \"It's really all about the story you are looking to tell -- all about the content. Yes, it will be more immersive, but how do you tell a story with VR in a way that makes it most compelling to your users? That starts with a strong creative concept and comprehensive storyboarding to make sure you are maximizing the impact.\"\n\nTo supplement the print article in the November issue, Elle and Jaunt used 3-D cameras to capture what it was like to be on set at the photo shoot. O'Malley said, \"With our first VR experience for Elle, we wanted it to relate to our print piece, but use the material in a totally new way. For example, on Elle.com we created a flipbook of images that enhanced the static article in a more traditional way; with VR, it's a 360\u02da, completely immersive experience. There is no photograph in Elle magazine of Max Vadukul shooting Jacquie Lee, but with VR, our readers can be on set with a renowned fashion photographer. The user gets to experience everything that comes with that, the kinds of things they'd never get to see otherwise.\"\n\nAnd, he continued, \"We can highlight that the leather jacket is available from this brand, the shoes are from that designer, and so on. So not only are we are serving up more information to the consumer, but we are also delivering great service plugs and drives to retail for our advertisers.\"\n\nScott Broock offered even more advice. \"Elle and Hearst have been leading the way in publishing, and now we're seeing more brands developing stories using VR. In terms of experiences you are developing, remember to focus on your demographic. First and foremost, you are taking them somewhere or telling a story that is going to be meaningful to them. Don't lose sight of the fact that 99% of people have never experienced virtual reality. When they do, each of them is going to enjoy what you create and have this experience of 'wow, this is amazing -- I want more.' Once you see how they react to it (smartphone VR), you'll really begin to understand its impact.\"\n\nFor those who haven't tried it -- check out the free Google Play app from Elle and Jaunt VR. It's so convincing that the next time someone asks if you've ever been on a fashion photo shoot, you are likely to answer yes.\n\nAs a brand or agency, you might know how you want to use VR to extend your strategy, but you may not know who can help bring your vision to life. You'll need developers to design, capture, and code experiences -- and hardware that allows users to consume your content. Here's a short rundown of key players in VR development -- if you know of any that we missed, please share it with us in the comments.\n\nVR Development Shops:\n\nTactic: Specializing in immersive experiences across digital platforms and real world installations. Highlighted by an emphasis on gesture recognition, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Tactic's work includes mobile AR with Jose Cuervo and the \"Throttle Up\" holographic jet engine experience with GE & BBDO.\n\nJaunt VR: Specializing in cinematic Virtual Reality, with a unique, comprehensive platform that enables creators to film, edit, and process live-action content for Virtual Reality viewers. Recent projects include concerts by Paul McCartney and Jack White, as well as a journey to Middle Earth to promote The Hobbit.\n\nFramestore: A fully immersive, interactive, and experiential Virtual Reality content studio from the Oscar-winning shop that did the visual effects for Gravity. Framestore is known for conceiving, creating, and executing for some of the biggest brands in the world. Recent work includes a promotion for Marvel's Avengers at CES, a virtual vacation with Marriott's \"Teleporter,\" and a VR experience for Christopher Nolan's Interstellar.\n\nVR is no longer a thing of the future. It's happening right now. And if you think your competitors are already developing VR experiences for their next campaigns, you're probably right. Jaunt VR has seen a swift rise in visibility since they released live concert experiences with Paul McCartney and Jack White for Cardboard VR, as well as their work with Elle, and a custom activation built for Warner Bros. The Hobbit.\n\nScott Broock works with brands every day and had this to say: \"Put your stake in the ground right now. There are major brands, networks, studios, sport leagues, and travel companies all planning their first VR activations. What you are going to see in the next three months are the first movers going at it aggressively and making clear that they are going to play in this space. And what they will find is that the market and users will reward them for getting these experiences out there first.\"\n\nLike the early movers on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook before them -- being first to market in VR means you'll gain the benefit of leading the pack, while simultaneously owning the unique space your experience will inhabit. Your marketing will benefit from the added PR, and you'll receive attention for the mere fact that you are creating opportunities where none existed before. Mike Woods of Framestore VR agrees. \"You are pretty much guaranteed to generate a few columns and media impressions just by being brave enough to throw yourself into virtual reality -- there is even a story around that because it's such early days.\" A month, season, or year from now, innovation in VR will still be happening, but being first to market is a one-time opportunity -- if you don't act now, it's going to pass you by.\n\nOculus Rift is an important part of the future of VR, but it's still just one piece of that future. Oculus (now owned by Facebook) has developed an incredible engine for virtual reality that specializes in long-format, highly interactive gaming VR -- but it's not for everyone. The fastest, most affordable way to get shorter-timed, accessible VR experiences to people everywhere is through smartphone-based, cardboard viewer VR. Mike Woods says, \"As an entry level thing everyone carries around a smartphone in their pocket, so the idea that you can generate brand experiences and excitement around VR with just some cardboard and the computer you carry around in your pocket all day -- it's a no brainer.\"\n\nJay Zasa is the SVP, Executive Creative Director for campaigns at R/GA, and he recently led the development of a virtual reality test drive with Volvo. He had this to say: \"The future is more like Google Cardboard than it is separate, expensive devices. I think that stuff [like Oculus Rift] will probably exist in some higher-end niche, but as a way for the masses to experience VR, it will have to be done in a way that uses existing devices like smartphones.\"\n\nOne of our founders, Patrick Buckley had this to add: \"Cardboard VR is a new, fundamentally different way to tell stories that are more immersive than any other digital experience people have known. It's more immersive than an IMAX film, and it's in your pocket already. As a brand, it's an amazing new marketing opportunity to have something so affordable that you can hand it out to your fans at events and they can immediately have an 'IMAX on steroids' experience with whatever story you want to put them in. It's really exciting -- and we are seeing brands and agencies opening their eyes to these opportunities on a daily basis.\"\n\nIn the past, inaccessibility to revolutionary devices has been a major obstacle in widespread adoption -- but with Cardboard VR for smartphones, that obstacle has been removed. Patrick Buckley says, \"radio took 38 years to reach 50M users, television took 14 years, and the Internet took 4 years. As current technology news indicates, VR is on a much quicker trajectory. Given the existing technology infrastructure, within one and a half years we're likely to see 50M VR users in the world. It's a huge opportunity.\"\n\nJust as with social media, mobile, and video before this -- understanding the capabilities of VR technology will help you reach users in new and compelling ways. \"Virtual reality can do so many things,\" added Mike Woods. \"Marketers can use this technology to drive attention, make a splash, show customers a side of the brand they haven't seen before, or even in retail positioning. VR [as we know it] is only about a year and a half in, and it's already quite an adaptable form.\"\n\nPeter Oberdorfer, the President at Tactic, a new agency that is already making waves with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality built for smartphones, agrees. One of their most recent projects was with McCann NY, where they created an AR mobile app experience for Jose Cuervo Tequila's \"History in a Bottle\" TV campaign. He had this to say about VR as the new 'what's next' platform in storytelling: \"In a way, it represents the convergence of mobile, gaming, and traditional Hollywood spectacle -- but people are still trying to discover how to author it. Some people take a more filmic approach, while others are designing game interactions -- but it isn't directly analogous to either medium. It's a hybridization of the two, and that's really mind-blowing. As people experiment, the storytelling will only evolve...and it's going to impact everything.\"\n\nThe Future Is Already In Our Pockets\n\nIn order to start experiencing VR, educating your teams, and building innovative stories for your brands, you need only to reach into your pocket, open your app store, and dig in.", "JACKSON, Miss.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "It seems like just last week the world was lamenting Apple's loss of hundreds of engineers to Tesla, that upstart automaker down the street in Palo Alto. And that's because it was just last week, but now the talk has shifted 180 degrees thanks to a Financial Times report. It states that Apple is making a series of major hires from the automotive world, creating a \"confidential Silicon Valley location\" to develop... something.\n\nAmong those hires? Johann Jungwirth, who until very recently was President and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America. His arrival, plus talk of other automotive engineers joining the ranks more quietly, has a lot of people speculating that Apple's next one more thing will be a car.\n\nI won't rule out Apple rolling out something on wheels sometime down the road, but for now, the most likely applications of this vehicular know-how are a lot more subtle -- but potentially a lot more interesting.\n\nHints from MBRDNA\n\nMercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, or MBRDNA as it's more tersely known, is the Silicon Valley epicenter for M-B's fancy thinking. I toured the facility when it opened in late 2013, and it is quite a place. Big and open and full of glass and brushed metal and, indeed, feeling very Apple-like.\n\nThat facility exists for a variety of reasons, perhaps chief among them establishing and building partnerships with other Valley startups, startups like Nest. Every room at MBRDNA has one or more of the smart thermostats stuck on the wall, 114 of the things overall.\n\nEveryone in the Valley is networking like their lives depends on it, but this sort of relationship points to a more subtle thing at MBRDNA: a desperate desire to make the car the center of your smart, contextualized life.\n\nFor example, while I was there, Jungwirth's team showed off a concept of a smart ski roof rack. NFC sensors could be attached to your skis, and then those planks, when clipped onto the roof, would tell the car to automatically program the navigation unit to your fabulous vacation home in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTouring the Mercedes-Benz Sunnyvale R&D center... See full gallery 1 - 4 / 24 Next Prev\n\nNow that frankly sounds a little silly, but it gets better. Not only would the car program in the destination, but it would call ahead to the Nest thermostat in your extravagent chalet and make sure it comes perfectly up to temperature just in time for you to walk through the front door and kick off your Uggs. (You would, sadly, have to start your own cup of hot cocoa.)\n\nThat's a very limited, rather unlikely scenario for most of us, but you can see the intent: rely on contextual information around the car to make your life better. The biggest problem for Mercedes-Benz is that the information available about you through your car is limited to say the least. Partnering with startups like Nest and Pebble and others gives more portals through which the car can look into your life.\n\nIn a car, you really only know what a user is doing for a few hours a day at the most. At Apple, that job of contextualizing your life is a lot easier. With a smartphone in their pocket, smart watch on their wrist, computer on their desk and various cloud services hovering overhead at all times, a lack of contextual clues will no longer be a problem for Jungwirth and his team.\n\nBuilding on CarPlay\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the most immediate thing we'll feel from this injection of automotive talent is a major boost to CarPlay. Tim Cook recently said that CarPlay is a \"key to our future\" at Apple, with the other two being HealthKit and HomeKit. So, it's reasonable to expect big investments here.\n\nApple CarPlay, the service in iOS that lets you safely access things like iTunes and Apple Maps from your dashboard, is a very young thing indeed, yet it's already making waves. Just about every major auto maker has pledged support -- including Mercedes-Benz -- and those who haven't surely will within the next year or so. When people see that they can stay connected while driving, and do so safely without breaking any distracted driving laws, they're going to want it (or Google's competing offering, Android Auto) in their next car.\n\nBut CarPlay is just a very simple thing right now, basically little more than a simplified view of iOS that's powered by your phone. No phone, no CarPlay.\n\nCarPlay will grow over the next year or two to include more features and functions, and the number of apps that can be controlled through the service will balloon, but it isn't hard to imagine a future revision of the service that does away with the phone requirement altogether.\n\nIf your music is in the cloud, your contacts in the cloud, your calendar and messages and lots of other juicy info up there too, who needs a phone to bring it into the car?\n\nRight now you do for two reasons: not all cars have active data connections, and auto manufacturers don't want Apple's software tied that closely into their dashboards. The first problem is rapidly disappearing, with more and more cars featuring cellular modems, while the second problem is really a question of willingness. That may take a little more time.\n\nBut, for the first brave car manufacturer to sign, the first car available with fully integrated Apple functionality could be quite a selling point. (Yes, I know having the first phone available with Apple functionality didn't work out well for the Moto Rokr, but I think we've all matured a lot in the 10 years since.)\n\nA self-driving Apple?\n\nThat all sounds practical enough, but gosh a car from Cupertino sounds juicy. Could Apple really be working on building a one? It's certainly possible. Apple currently has $178 billion in cash floating around. It could buy all the outstanding shares of Ford if it wanted, and General Motors too, and still have plenty of reserves to build a facility big enough for all the world's Mustang and Camaro fans to come together and better understand each others' differences.\n\nThe better question is whether it makes sense for Apple to build a car in the first place. In my opinion the answer is no, not yet, but that could change soon. As we've seen, Apple has struggled to get a television off the ground. A car is far more complicated, certainly in terms of manufacturing but also in terms of certifying the thing to be road-legal. Hell, as Tesla has shown, even selling the things is a headache.\n\nIf it wanted to, Apple could out-source the whole mess and let someone else do the hard work on the hardware, which is exactly what Google has done for its self-driving cars (manufactured by Detroit-based Roush Industries). But you can bet that Apple would want to have a much bigger hand in controlling the specifics of the design -- if only to make sure they don't wind up looking like clown cars. This would mean a major team of experienced mechanical engineers and industrial designers.\n\nApple in the fast lane\n\nWe still don't know exactly what the automotive future of Apple looks like. For the record, when I politely asked Apple representatives to tell me they politely declined to comment. At a minimum, I know that Johann Jungwirth built an amazing team of talent around him at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, and I expect him to do the same at Apple.\n\nIn the near-term, look for CarPlay to get bigger and better.

Add to this hospital visits (one or twice every month) and the cost of each session (Rs 20,000 to over Rs 1 lakh a month). And the fact that the treatment can continue for six-eight months, maybe more. Just imagine the time, money and effort involved in all this. But what if the treatment is administered at home and that too at a lower cost?\n\nHome care services, already a $75 billion industry in the US, have caught the fancy of Indian start-ups as well as big players such as Max Healthcare and Dabur Ltd promoters. In India, the industry is estimated to be worth $2-4 billion.\n\n\"As a result of advances in communication and medical technology, a lot of interventions that were earlier possible only in hospitals are now possible at home. This helps patients save on room rent and allied costs. Total savings come to 20-25%,\" says Haresh Trivedi, director, Max Home Healthcare\n\nHome care companies provide attendants, nurses, physiotherapists and doctors at home to take care of senior citizens as well as patients after surgery. They employ people who can carry out medical procedures such as chemotherapy and dialysis at home. Some also provide medical equipment and furniture. We discuss some of the most common services offered.\n\nPost-surgery care: After surgery, most patients remain in hospital under observation. If they are discharged earlier and rehabilitated at home, they will save a lot of money. The hospital, too, will make more money by giving the bed to someone else.\n\nThere is another benefit too. \"There is a drop in compliance to the treatment plan after discharge from hospital. A home care service provider can provide support at home,\" says Meena Ganesh, co-founder and CEO, Portea Medical, a home care service provider.\n\nPost-surgery services include pain management, intravenous antibiotic therapy, diet monitoring, wound care and physiotherapy. In most cases, this requires the expertise of a nurse or an attendant. If provided at hospital, the bill may include doctor's fee (at times for just stopping by and enquiring about your well-being), room rent and cost of food. At home, you can cut down the cost of room rent and food. \"The savings can be 10-20% depending on the surgery,\" says Ganesh.\n\nChronic care: Non-communicable diseases (or chronic diseases) account for 40% hospitalisation cases in India. These include coronary heart diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes. If not managed, these can sharply increase costs. So, chronic care is an important aspect of the health care system. Given the need for expert day-to-day care, getting these services in a hospital means regular visits, even a short period of hospitalisation. This is inconvenient and costly.\n\nAs an alternative, home care providers offer services such as day-to-day disease management, regular observation, pain & diet management and counselling and carry out procedures such as chemotherapy and dialysis.\n\n\"We offers services in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders and asthma, neuro problems and chronic congestive heart failure. We also offer post-operative wound management for diabetics and home physiotherapy for pain management and rehabilitation,\" says Vishal Bali, co-founder and chairman, Medwell Ventures. Medwell offers services under the Nightingales brand, which it acquired recently. Nightingales earlier used to serve only senior citizens.\n\n\"Our effort is to reduce recurrent hospitalisation cost by 20-30% every year for patients with chronic diseases. Our one-month package for severe stroke recovery is Rs20,000 as against the hospitalisation cost of Rs 5,000 a day,\" says Bali. Geriatric care: Life expectancy is rising in India, thanks to improved health services. The population of those aged 60 and above will increase from 8% at present to 12% by 2025 and 18% by 2050.\n\nTaking care of ageing parents is already an major issue given the shrinking size of families. So, home care providers also offer nurses and trained attendants and, if needed, doctors to take care of senior citizens.\n\nInfirmity can restrict a person's movement in old age and he/she may need help for bathing, dressing, eating, medication and mobility. V Thiyagrajan, co-founder, India Home Healthcare, which provides care givers, says earlier the company used to hire nurses but later realised that helping the elderly in mobility, eating, bathing, mediation, etc, does not require their expertise. \"So, we started hiring people who would otherwise work as domestic helps. They are trained for three months before being deputed,\" he says.\n\nHowever, depending on the need, care providers also arrange visits of doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. Care to new mothers, new borns and other services: Both new borns and their mothers need a lot of care. While at hospital they are taken care of by the staff, some service providers offer similar care at home after discharge. Some also offer services for children born with disabilities, including training and counselling.\n\nOther services include collection of samples for tests, delivery of medicines, physiotherapy and sale and renting of medical equipment.\n\nFringe Benefit For Insurers\n\nThough many medical procedures can be cheaper when carried out at home, they may not be covered by your insurance policy. So, we talked to insurers-standalone health insurers and general insurance companies-to know where they stand on these services. This is what we found. Indemnity plans do not cover home care as a separate category. However, some services offered by home care providers are covered only if prescribed by doctors or if expenses incurred are an extension of hospitalisation. These are covered under these broad categories:\n\nMax Bupa Health Insurance covers home care services for the elderly if prescribed by a doctor. It also covers home care under domiciliary treatment. Some insurers cap the cover under domiciliary treatment. For example, Religare Health Insurance covers domiciliary treatment up to 10% sum insured. That means if the sum insured is Rs 3 lakh, it will pay an expense of up to Rs 30,000 on domiciliary treatment.\n\nDay care treatments and OPD: Some medical procedures can be done without the patient having to stay in a hospital for 24 hours (the basic criterion for getting covered under an indemnity plan). Some common day-care procedures include cataract surgery, hemodialysis, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Some insurers cover only a few home services under the OPD category. Cigna TTK provides health maintenance benefits ranging from Rs 500-15,000 a year for consultation, nursing care, pharmacy expenses, diagnostic tests and physiotherapy under ProHealth plan.\n\n\"Under the Global Health Group Plan, we also cover home nursing up to the full sum insured irrespective of whether it is associated with hospitalisation or not,\" says Sandeep Patel, CEO, Cigna TTK Health Insurance. ICICI Lombard also covers some home care treatments under OPD. \"Some services like physiotherapy, consultation, routine diagnostics, etc, can be covered in the OPD category,\" says Sanjay Datta, chief, underwriting & claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance.\n\nPre- and post-hospitalisation: Medical expenses before and after hospitalisation are covered by all insurers. The expenses should be due to the illness that led to hospitalisation. The period of pre- and posthospitalisation coverage differs from insurer to insurer. For example, Religare Health covers expenses of up to 30 days before and 60 days after hospitalisation, while Cigna TTK covers expenses up to 90 days before and 180 days after hospitalisation.\n\n\"Our Care policy covers 30 days pre-hospitalisation & 60 days post-hospitalisation expenses; this applies to any treatment availed of by the insured pertaining to the ailment for which she has been hospitalised and is limited to the sum insured,\" says Anuj Gulati, MD & CEO Religare Health Insurance Company.\n\nHome care services such as post-surgery and chronic care can be covered under this category. Other than the above, some home treatments are covered as part of value-added services by Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. \"Any Bajaj Allianz Health Insurance policy holder can avail of discounts with some home care service providers with whom we have a tie-up,\" says Renuka Kanvinde, associate vice president, health insurance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.\n\nThough companies and medical fraternity talk about insurance beyond hospitalisation, it seems insurers are still apprehensive about covering home care as a separate category. Kanvinde of Bajaj Allianz says that there is need to first standardise basic health services covered by insurance; home health care is not even on the radar of companies. She says the country needs to develop an effective accreditation system for hospitals and doctors before we can think of home health care. \"While home care can be instrumental in managing clinical pathways to enable better outcomes and reduce costs, standardisation with some basic protocols, including empanelment of doctors, is a key requirement,\" says Somesh Chandra, COO and chief quality officer, Max Bupa Health Insurance.", "Global financial markets are now highly focused on the turmoil surrounding Greece's debt burden.\n\nBut \"two other recent pieces of news underscore why the EU is in a serious economic and political crisis that could have devastating consequences for the U.S. and the rest of the world,\" Steve Forbes, editor-in-chief of Forbes, writes in the magazine.\n\nThe first item is the European Central Bank (ECB)'s decision last month to launch a 1.1 trillion euro quantitative easing package.\n\n\"The ECB is repeating the mistakes of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan,\" Forbes argues.\n\n\"Price controls always harm and distort markets. Suppressing interest rates has seriously distorted credit markets around the world.\"\n\nThe second item is less well-known. The ECB has decided to tighten capital requirements on European banks.\n\n\"The ECB's cluelessness is breathtaking,\" Forbes writes. \"How does a bank increase its capital cushion? By selling new equity, cutting dividends -- and making fewer loans. . . . Politically unconnected businesses, i.e., most of the private sector, are shafted.\"\n\nIn addition, the move gives Europe's politicians \"an excuse\" to avoid necessary economic restructuring, he explains.\n\nThe worst-case outcome of all this is a collapse of the EU and the euro. That \"would be disastrous, putting the world on a chaotic course not seen since the 1930s,\" he maintains.\n\nMeanwhile, many financial experts are worried about the raging global currency war. And Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says the war might last for a while.\n\n\"Not all currencies can depreciate against one another at the same time. But the current wave of efforts, despite being far from optimal, can persist for a while, so long as at least two conditions are met,\" he writes in an article for Project Syndicate.\n\n\"The first condition is America's continued willingness to tolerate a sharp appreciation of the dollar's exchange rate.\" The greenback has reached multi-year highs against many currencies in recent weeks.\n\nGiven the strong dollar's harm for U.S. companies and our trade balance, \"this is not guaranteed,\" El-Erian notes. \"Still, as long as the U.S. maintains its pace of overall growth and job creation -- a feasible outcome -- these developments are unlikely to trigger a political response for quite a while.\"\n\nThe second condition is \"financial markets' willingness to assume and maintain risk postures that are not yet validated by the economy's fundamentals,\" he writes. \"With central banks pushing for increasingly large financial risk-taking, this is no easy feat.\"\n\nRelated Stories:", "LIC garnered new premium of Rs 51,667.07 crore during the first three quarters of 2014-15 as against Rs 65,774.47 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal, a decline of 21.4 percent.

Allianz has done some legwork to parse the most discussed travel topics on Internet forums to reveal what users are talking about, and how that changes depending on the nationality of the user.\n\nAs far as methodology, the study authors selected forums from Google using \"forum + travel,\" \"forum + tourism\" and \"forum + holidays\" to make their selections. They then sorted through the most popular forums that had a dedicated travel area that focused on wider travel topics outside of specific destinations. They then selected 5-10 forums per country, and excluded forums where the nationality wasn't clear.

All of the gatherings featured suspenseful atmospheres, dramatic posturing and some public tantrums. And their outcomes were similar, too: The participants ended up just buying time, without doing much, if anything, to begin to address the underlying causes of the unfolding crises.\n\nIn the first instance, President Francois Hollande of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany traveled to Minsk on Wednesday to compel the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to stem the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine that has claimed about 5,000 lives. After a tough all-night negotiation session, they agreed Thursday to a cease-fire to take effect this weekend.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the finance ministers of the euro zone countries gathered in Brussels to try to find common ground on Greece. After seven hours of discussions, they weren't even able to settle on a road map for future negotiations.\n\nBut with both their finance ministers playing tough and signaling seemingly unbridgeable negotiating positions, Merkel and the newly elected prime minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, were subsequently able to show leadership and be \"presidential.\" On Thursday, both declared themselves willing to compromise, providing much needed political cover for the finance ministers' negotiations that are set to resume Monday (preceded by technical preparations starting today).\n\nEarlier in the week, some of those ministers had joined their central bank colleagues in Istanbul for a meeting of the Group of 20. The agenda included policy actions to strengthen a global economy that, with the exception of the U.S., has been losing steam. In their communiques, they reaffirmed prior commitments and renewed their encouragement of central banks to continue pursuing unconventional monetary policies.\n\nYes, some progress was made in all three meetings, but they mainly just kicked the can down the road. At best, they were holding operations that risk resulting in failure if they aren't quickly supplemented by more comprehensive agreements.\n\nThere is widespread skepticism the Ukrainian cease-fire can hold. The agreement is very similar to an earlier deal, also negotiated in Minsk, that fell apart. There is still very little trust between the opposing parties, both among the political leaders and combatants. And there are still no credible verification and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nWithout more meaningful efforts, the cease-fire will quickly come under pressure and risk collapse. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian and Russian economies will continue to implode.\n\nAs for Greece, the emerging compromise concerns only its immediate financing needs. The parties remain very far apart when it comes to how, why and when the new government would recast austerity, deepen structural reforms and secure additional debt relief.\n\nThe G-20 meeting was similarly uninspiring. It not only failed to come up with any substantive policies, it also ended up endorsing an approach that relies too heavily on central bank measures, thereby encouraging countries to seek to devalue their currency and raising the risks of a slide into an accidental currency war.\n\nUnless bold political leadership emerges that fosters the conditions for sensible compromises on comprehensive solutions, it is only a matter of time before this week's three modest achievements give way to greater instability and tensions that would further undermine the global economy. The international community may have succeeded in pressing three pause buttons under tough negotiating conditions. But what the world really needs is to fast forward to happier endings.\n\n_ Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz, chairman of President Obama's Global Development Council and the former chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer of Pimco.\n\nFor more columns from Bloomberg View, visit http://www.bloomberg.com/view\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Chicago Tribune"]}, "Total": {"2015-02-12": ["Media reports that a US police constable roughed up a 57-year-old Indian in Alabama so badly that he was paralysed are shocking. Sureshbhai Patel was walking on the footpath outside his son's home in Madison when patrol cops accosted him because someone called the police to report a suspicious character in the neighbourhood. Patel, who came to the US only two weeks ago to help his son and daughter-in-law with their 17-month-old child, was roughed up, shoved to the ground, and cuffed -- a standard procedure that usually involves excess force if the suspect is coloured. The external affairs ministry has done well to summon a US embassy official to South Block and demand expeditious investigation into the matter.\n\nThe incident underscores the well-chronicled police brutality against minorities and coloured people in the US even as its president goes around the world delivering homilies about tolerance, human rights and civil liberties. The US has the largest number of incarcerated people in the world, far more than the dictatorships and totalitarian regimes it chastises (and patronises), and it hardly seems embarrassed about it. New Delhi must take up the issue with US authorities at the highest level. The US must ensure the policeman responsible for the incident is brought to book and such incidents do not recur.\n\nPresident Obama should know better because his own community of blacks has been hounded as victim of racial discrimination and attacks for countless years. He must first look within before pointing fingers at countries like India where both the Opposition in Parliament and the media zealously guard the minorities against racial attacks. There are aberrations that inevitably occur from time to time but they are roundly condemned by people at large. The Indian authorities do not go about bragging about religious tolerance in the country. Racial profiling in the US is a fact of life. Let there be no doubt that Sureshbhai Patel was treated shabbily because in the US there are different standards for coloureds.", "I had the good fortune in early February to accompany Carl H\u00e9tu to a few of the schools and churches in this part of Alberta.\n\nCarl is the national director of an organization called the Catholic Near East Welfare Association (CNEWA). CNEWA's goal and purpose is to raise awareness in other parts of the world of the plight of Christians in the near east, and to raise money for their relief.\n\nThis is the same part of the world that we hear about daily in our newscasts - Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Sudan. The recent threat is ISIS (or sometimes called ISIL), but the tensions are not as recent as the development of this radical and fundamentalist group of terrorists. The ethnic and religious tensions in that region of the world reach back to a complex history, and their resolution is equally confounding.\n\nCarl and others who are familiar with this region point out that for many years now, several of these ethnic and religious groups have co-existed in a mutual acceptance of one another's presence. The events of the past couple of years have shattered that truce. The violence of the Middle East is spilling out all over the world.\n\nWhen the Charlie Hebdo massacre happened in France in early January, the reaction of the world was immediate. Many notable experts and people on the street weighed in on the causes of these actions in Europe and the possible ways of dealing with them.\n\nI, for one, found some of the rhetoric hard to accept, especially around freedom of speech. Granted, this is one of the freedoms that we enjoy in western societies, and it is a freedom that often distinguishes us from more totalitarian nations. We appreciate the fact that we will not be arrested and jailed for speaking for a cause, nor will we face reprisal for criticizing a political party or its policies. Freedom of speech is indeed a treasured component of our multicultural society.\n\nWe must in all humility recognize the power of words. Many famous writers over the centuries have recognized this very fact, and have cautioned us to recognize the power of our words, for good or for ill. In the work \"Teachings of Ahiqar\" (an Assyrian 7th century sage), dating to about 500 BC, it is stated that \"The word is mightier than the sword.\"\n\nThe New Testament Letter to the Hebrews (4:12) affirms that \"Indeed, the word of God is living and effective, sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating even between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and able to discern reflections and thoughts of the heart.\"\n\nThe Islamic prophet Mohammed is quoted as saying \"The ink of the scholar is holier than the blood of the martyr.\"\n\nAbout words and their power, consider these thoughts from the letter of James: \"... the tongue is a fire. /.../ For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, but no one can tame the tongue -- a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and brackish water? Can a fig tree, my brothers and sisters, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh\" (James 3:6-12).\n\nSpeaking of \"freedom of speech,\" I was always taught that freedoms are not without responsibilities. We cannot exercise any freedom without giving due respect to the consequences of the exercise of that freedom. As Pope Francis shared with journalists at the time of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, if you come into a man's house and insult his mother, he's probably going to hit you.\n\nWhen I was a child, bullied by classmates, my mother's best consolation for me was \"Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me.\"\n\nMy difficulty with this intended balm is that it isn't true. Names can hurt us. They can insult what we most cherish and consider sacred. A good rule of thumb that I use about saying anything, especially whatever may be very sensitive to others around me, is to ask three questions: Is it true? Is it an act of charity to say it? Does the other person need to hear it? Even though I enjoy freedom of speech, it isn't necessary to say everything that comes into my mind.\n\nMy father would say, \"It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.\"", "Without wanting to dampen the sentiment, I hesitate to pile on the \"Je suis, Charlie\" chorus.\n\nIn part, because in our long comfortable part of the world, contesting religious doctrine of any sort has become superfluous to 'live and let live' pragmatism.\n\nEspecially when, for those with family (or capital) at risk, the fear of retribution more than offsets whatever social benefits can presently be aspired to result from tweaking far away (or decidedly minority local) Islamic sentiments.\n\nThat said, as recently as December I alone played contrarian to a public forum whose local participants uniformly argued Islam was: a) forged in and predicated on violence; b) recklessly mixed religion and nationalism; c) intolerant and repressive.\n\nAnd regardless the relative accuracy of either argument, the probably more important takeaway is the extent to which this debate might be escaping the moderates on both sides.\n\nWhich is regrettable because today's 'Liberal democracies' are a great many things - some definitely less than perfect, but they are unmistakably responsive to external challenge.\n\nFor example, circa 1941, Japanese militants convinced themselves that isolationist America lacked the fortitude to wage war in the Pacific, much less match disciples of their Bushido code.\n\nIn response, weapons of unimaginable destructiveness were both developed and deployed.\n\nEqually during the post-war period, Communist propaganda predicted their economic and technological progress would soon eclipse their capitalist adversaries.\n\nInstead, America put a man on the moon and still spent the Soviet economy into collapse.\n\nThus, Al Queda's strategy of compelling Western military forces to withdraw from Arabic Holy Lands through imposing casualties should not have expected results other than expansion of the U.S. military (to now over 900 bases in 130-plus countries).\n\nAnd though Osama bin Laden, post 9/11, rationalized such over-reach was advantageous insofar as eventually bankrupting the U.S. empire, the past decade proves he underestimated the degree American leaders are willing to sacrifice \"butter\" for \"guns.\"\n\nImportantly then the evidence, both historically and sociologically, is quite clear that terrorist attacks against the west will prove counter-productive.\n\nNot because of any specific principle - freedom of the press being relative insofar as France itself has long banned publication of pro-Nazi material whilst literally every government prohibits an arbitrary level of both sedition and pornography.\n\nBut rather because the momentum of human development insists the wrong way to advance an idea or cause is via threatening others.\n\nIn context, the dispatch of easily misled 20-year-olds to die for \"God and Country\" reached an apex of idiocy in the trenches of the \"War to End All Wars.\"\n\nUsing analogous terminology affords unwarranted credibility to little more than deluded zealots - in this instance, motivated by a restriction against depicting their prophet that is neither written in the Koran nor the contention of the wide majority of Muslim leaders.\n\nTo put even more of a point on it, the perpetrators of 9/11, 3/11, 7/7, Parliament Hill, Sydney Caf\u00e9 et al. are outliers to the causes they claim to support.\n\nAt very best, their violence gains attention, which distracts from rather than emphasizes cited comparisons with, say, western subsidized Israeli military strikes against Palestinian targets.\n\nEven ISIS is more the consequence of conflict between Islamist schisms, Syrian totalitarianism and pan-Arab poverty than it is solely about religion.\n\nAnd, thus, reflexively echoing an overly simplistic slogan concerns me - as much for the implications to adversaries as for the impositions on friends.", "The modern world is a mess of seeming contradictions. Children have never been safer, yet parents have never been more anxiously overprotective. We have more leeway than ever before to lead free, quirky, customized private lives, yet governments have unprecedented power to inspect and disrupt our most intimate activities. Fewer jets crashed in 2014 than since the advent of commercial air travel, yet CNN switches to wall-to-wall coverage every time a Boeing goes missing.\n\nThis collection of seemingly opposed notions actually shares a single throughline, one you can see running all over this special issue on aging. Human beings, as a species, are treating each individual as incredibly precious-much more so than we have in the past. This is a remarkable and transformative development, though it presents challenges and not a small amount of cognitive dissonance, particularly for the more libertarian among us.\n\nBefore the advent of modern medicine, birth control, and (in much of the developing world) economic prosperity, men and women produced batches of kids, knowing that some may die but enough would survive to take care of their parents and propagate the family line. Now more than half the world's people, including the 320 million of us in the United States, live in countries where the fertility rate-the average number of births per woman-is below the replacement level of 2.1. Mexican women averaged 7.3 births in 1960; today that number is 2.2. India in the 1970s was widely projected to suffer from mass starvation due to overpopulation; now it is on the verge of sinking below the replacement rate.\n\nWe know what happens in economic terms when goods become scarce. Prices and valuations go up, and owners invest more in upkeep and maintenance. The same is now happening with people, with mostly good but sometimes challenging side effects.\n\nTake war. Every day I walk past a memorial in my local park commemorating 187 men from my neighborhood alone who died in World War I. That's only 71 fewer U.S. military deaths than in the entire 1991 Gulf War.\n\nWhile the staunchest anti-interventionists among us may feel a sense of constant fatigue and dismay, the fact is that there is less war and less war-death than ever. In the year of reason's birth, 1968, more U.S. military personnel died in Vietnam-16,592-than have died in every subsequent American military adventure combined. It is inconceivable that we would tolerate the idea of 36,000 Americans dying in a foreign nation's three-year civil war, as happened on the Korean peninsula in the 1950s. And our reluctance to take on casualties pales in comparison to the reluctance in less-interventionist Western countries.\n\nThe downside is that ever higher premiums on life create opportunities to exploit emotional overreactions to discrete incidents. The United States right now is waging a low-intensity war against the Islamic State (ISIS) within Syria in large part because ISIS terrorists beheaded a couple of American hostages.\n\nGovernments that do not value the lives of human beings end up treating them like pawns and cannon fodder. It's no accident that many of the most effective opponents of totalitarianism were iconoclastic individualists like Vaclav Havel and Adam Michnik. And yet, as the Russian chess champion-turned-dissident Garry Kasparov reminds us (\"Checking Putin,\" page 48), success in the West has led to a crippling aversion to risk taking. America essentially gave up space exploration for two generations out of an excessive sense of caution.\n\nValuing human life begins in the mirror, and as Ronald Bailey notes in his cover story (\"Eternal Youth for All!,\" page 22), this is driving a self-interested collection of pioneer thinkers and scientists to tackle the aging process head-on. One anxiety about that, explored in David Goldhill's masterful review of Atul Gawande's book Being Mortal (\"Dying and in Denial,\" page 56), is that older people will just stretch out the dying process in ways that are dehumanizing and expensive. What to do about this conundrum?\n\n\"Pervasive change,\" Goldhill argues, \"can only start with recognizing that today's incentives point away from more personalized, more sensitive, and more humane medicine.\" This is mostly due to the centralized, government-mandated, 800-pound gorilla of Medicare. \"Medicare, as our surrogate, has unleashed a torrent of unnecessary care, accidental death, and inattention to the personal needs of the patient.\" In the rest of the economy, he notes, \"we use markets and actual consumers to drive diversity of choice and service. If we want the benefits of personalized care-not just end-of-life care, but all care-we'll need to bring these same incentives into medicine.\"\n\nGrowing valuation of the individual is driving everything from medical innovation to the creation of unofficial currencies (see Andrea Castillo's \"Private Money in Virtual Worlds,\" page 67). But those more fearful of selfishness have reason to cheer, too. Notable skeptic Michael Shermer argues provocatively (\"Are We Becoming Morally Smarter?,\" page 42) that great leaps forward in abstract reasoning are leading not only to better performance on IQ tests (producing the famous \"Flynn effect\"), but also greater moral empathy for our fellow man and woman.\n\n\"Abstract reasoning leads us to consider members of other tribes (nations) as potential trading partners to be respected rather than as potential enemies to be conquered or killed,\" Shermer writes. We have \"improved in our capacity to lump blacks and whites, men and women, straights and gays into the category 'human.'\"\n\nProgress on these fronts doesn't always move in a straight line. Understandable outrage over the 9/11 attacks prompted too many Americans to embrace as a counter-weapon the inherently dehumanizing weapon of torture, a moral detour from which we have yet to fully return (see Jacob Sullum's \"Torture As an Absolute Wrong,\" page 14). Then again, as Sara Mayeux notes in \"Cruel, Unusual, and Crowded\" (page 71), we are on the verge of a long-overdue prison-reform movement in this country attributable directly to the growing sentiment that even convicted criminals are individuals worthy of at least some human dignity.\n\nOne of the most moving-but ultimately self-defeating-slogans to come out of last summer's Ferguson mess was \"black lives matter.\" It was an immediately relatable reminder of the value of human life, and the callousness with which some from less-favored classes are treated. But it sadly morphed into a tool of alienation rather than empathy, as when Smith College President Kathleen McCartney felt compelled to walk back her campus-wide reminder that \"all lives matter\" (italics added). McCartney was right: Conferring individual dignity on every human category is how we arrive more rapidly at a more just and free world.\n\nThere's a reason why the enlightened world erupted spontaneously with the slogan \"Je suis Charlie\" after 12 staffers of the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo were assassinated by Islamic fanatics in January. It wasn't because the phrase was technically accurate-if we were all Charlie Hebdo, we'd be a lot braver than we have been until now. But it was an expression of pure human empathy in the face of inhuman slaughter, a demonstration of Enlightenment values in the face of seventh-century atavism.\n\nValuing human life separates us from poisonous cultures, unfree regimes, and untrammeled sadists. It elevates us from where our own societies were 100 years ago, or even 10. It will lead us down some occasionally absurd and illiberal alleyways: zero-tolerance policies for children, centralized overreactions to tragedy, space programs unwilling to tolerate risks to astronauts. But by valorizing individual worth and latitude, we create a culture where, perhaps for the first time in history, people take seriously the Golden Rule.", "The regime marks its 70th anniversary with a new propaganda barrage.\n\nI've been addicted to Juche kitsch since my teens, when I would sometimes read an English-language North Korean newspaper just to gape at its weird, worshipful descriptions of Kim Il Sung. (This should give you the flavor.) It's easy to laugh at Pyongyang's propaganda, because the gap is so great between what it attempts and what it achieves: The language is supposed to soar, and instead it sounds ridiculous. An ordinary personality cult is laughable enough, but this one sounds like it's run by a syndicate of drunk surrealists.\n\nNow the dictatorship has released 310 new slogans. To judge from the translations appearing in the Western press, that syndicate of surrealists seems to be even drunker than usual:\n\n\"Let the strong wind of fish farming blow across the country!\"...\n\n\"Let us turn the whole country into a socialist fairyland by the joint operation of the army and people!\"...\n\n\"Should the enemy dare to invade our country, annihilate them to the last man so that none of them will survive to sign the instrument of surrender!\"...\n\n\"Let us turn ours into a country of mushrooms by making mushroom cultivation scientific, intensive and industrialized!\"\n\nMaybe it's too easy to laugh at Pyongyang's propaganda. We're reading it in English, after all, and it's surely possible that it got worse in translation. Westerners are willing to believe all kinds of dubious stories about the Kims' country; maybe we've been overstating just how strange its totalitarian prose is too. Maybe these slogans sound better in Korean.\n\nOr maybe, if you actually have to live under that regime, they sound even worse.", "Last week, the Community Security Trust, a charity that records attacks and harassment against Jews living in the UK, recorded 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in 2014 -- double the figure reported in the previous year.\n\nOn Monday, a group of British MPs published a report noting that whenever there is heightened conflict in the Middle-East, the rate of crime against Jews in the UK increases. The All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism (APPGAA) also noted that the problem \"continues to emanate from Islamist extremists, far-left and far-right groups\" and made a number of recommendations to government, the police and the media to combat the issue.\n\nThe APPGAA report singles out social media as \"a breeding ground for serious discriminatory and racist content\" and recommends that the Crown Prosecution Service explores the use of prevention orders in cases where someone has been prosecuted for cyber-hate. Offenders would have their devices confiscated and be banned from using social media. The newspapers have labelled this idea 'Twitter ASBOs'.\n\nIn developing this recommendation, the APPGAA discusses the Communications Act 2003, which criminalises 'grossly offensive' messages sent online. This is a problematic part of our law. 'Grossly offensive' is highly subjective, and there have been cases where obviously political or religious speech has been prosecuted under the Act. In recent years the CPS has prosecuted far fewer people under this law, but if there is a renewed vigour in prosecuting such messages, it is highly likely that more people expressing religious or political views will find themselves in the dock on charges of 'offence'.\n\nThe APPGAA's call for restrictions on the use of social media comes in the context of a systematic squeezing of free speech online. Last year, Parliament increased the possible sentence for a conviction under s.1. of the Malicious Communications Act 1988. Twitter Asbos may seem benign in themselves, and it is clear the Members of Parliament who authored the report intend them to be used carefully. But the proposals are part of a pattern that squeezes freedom of expression and invites overreach.\n\nThe terrible irony of this proposal is that, while it will probably lead to an unintended chill on legitimate free speech, it is doubtful that it will be effective at combating anti-Semitism. The idea of an ongoing order that will stop people using the Internet has a whiff of King Canute about it.\n\nAnyone can register a new email address and Twitter account to post whatever they want. Those who find their usernames banned, blocked or even subject to a court order will simply be able to register another username to circumvent the restrictions.\n\nSuch orders would only be enforceable if accompanied by stringent surveillance of the ex-offenders, which brings its own civil liberties concerns as well as issues of cost.\n\nIn the meantime, such laws create 'free speech martyrs'. When the notorious historian David Irving was imprisoned in Austria for giving lectures denying the Holocaust, he became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for those of a similar mindset. He was able to invoke the notion of a totalitarian spectre shutting down free speech. The Far Right often use such rhetoric, claiming the mythical Politically Correct Brigade is frightened of \"the truth\". Those who want to believe anti-Semitic smears will readily believe that they, too, are a persecuted minority.\n\nThe APPGAA report does note that \"a residual benefit of hate material appearing online, of course, is that it is relatively easy to report\". It is certainly the case that censoring hate speech just sends it underground.\n\nIf a person cannot use Twitter as an outlet for his views, they will use some other method that we find harder to track. The authorities are left with the impression that the problem has been dealt with, but the racists' sentiments fester in places where they cannot be challenged.\n\nIt is far better to have the bigotry out in the open where it can be challenged, rather than sweeping it under a legal carpet. Whenever the claims of far-right groups are actually scrutinised they are exposed as ill-considered. Their views are often an emotional response to a deeper unease in society -- a symptom of something larger, rather than a considered political position.\n\nRidiculous and morally questionable\n\nThose on the frontline of the battle against anti-Semitism must find the critiques of free speech activists extremely frustrating. Are we to simply stand-by and watch as the unpleasant and divisive language increases? Certainly not. Indeed, I think it is ridiculous and morally questionable to campaign for the right to free speech, and then not utilise that right to combat and counter racism.\n\nAs Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said this week, \"we need society to become as vocally intolerant of faith hatred as it is of other forms of discrimination.\" Such 'vocal intolerance' begins on Twitter, where ordinary people can take a stand against anti-Semitism wherever they find it.\n\nTo properly eradicate anti-Semitism, we need more opportunities for cultural exchange and to hear the stories of the Jewish diaspora. The APPGAA recognises this, suggesting more educational measures for schools, and inter-faith initiatives. Public events like the Holocaust Memorial Day are essential.\n\nTo this list, I would add another crucial project -- the promotion of Jewish literature. Where better to learn more about, and empathise with, the Jewish community than through its literary culture? Jewish Book Week, the JQ-Wingate Prize and the Amy Levy Prize are desperately important and deserve our support.\n\nFor its part, my own organisation English PEN has supported the translation of books like Ruth Maier's Diary, The Dove Flyer, The Patagonian Hare and Back To Back, all of which speak to the complex and often difficult nature of the Jewish experience.\n\nAll of these literary initiatives are only possible because we have robust free speech protections in this country. We must use our own right to free speech to counter the anti-Semitic narrative and replace it with something far more positive.\n\nThis is a long-term approach that does not provide the satisfaction of yet another law that bans certain kinds of speech. But it is imperative that we focus on the underlying problem, and not be distracted by 140-character manifestations of hatred that we see on social media.\n\nRobert Sharp is head of campaigns at English PEN. For more on Robert, go to his author page here.", "In Cinema: A Public Affair, Russian documentarist Tatiana Brandrup chronicles the rise and fall of the Moscow Film Museum, one of the gems of the perestroika reform movement, as she paints a vibrant portrait of its legendary director Naum Kleiman. Using on-camera testimony by former museum staff and loyal film-goers like Leviathan director Andrey Zvyagintsev, interviews with Kleiman and excerpts from the film collection, this is an openly partisan account of the political decision to curb the museum's activities. Far from investigative journalism (in fact the real reasons behind the museum's woes are never clear), it is a celebration of a modest, inspiring cultural figure whose conviction that cinema can be used to construct a free civil society is a more contagious idea than a TED talk. This is not just a doc about an unfortunate change of staff, but a ringing alarm bell warning of the return of totalitarianism in Russia.\n\nIt is appropriate that it is bowing in the independent Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival. The historic founders of the Forum, Ulrich and Erika Gregor, first met Kleiman at a youth rally in Moscow where they discovered how similar their tastes in film were. They are still friends.\n\nThe film was produced by the Berlin-based company Filmkantine.\n\nThese are the facts: in 1989, as the Soviet Union was collapsing and the winds of perestroika blew over the country, Kleiman opened the Moscow State Central Cinema Museum, including a cinematheque which eventually included some 150,000 titles in its electronic catalog. It became a haven for artistic and intellectual discussion. But in 2005, for spurious reasons, the building housing the museum was sold, the museum closed and all its belongings were essentially dumped on the street. Homeless and fighting for survival, the museum was forced to put its collection in storage and the cinematheque to screen its films in venues around town. Then last July, acting on the recommendation of the influential head of the Filmmakers' Union Nikita Mikhalkov, the culture ministry appointed Larisa Solonitsyna to replace Kleiman, who was given a figurehead role as museum president. The honeymoon didn't last long. In October, all 19 staff members at the museum handed in their resignations in protest over what they called Solonitsyna's professional incompetence. Kleiman himself resigned in November, bringing an era in Russia's cultural life to a close.\n\nThis would be just another sad and depressing story were it not for the 77-year-old Kleiman's irrepressible spirit that sheds a glow of mild-mannered intelligence every time he comes on screen. One of the world's greatest scholars of Sergei Eisenstein (affectionately called \"Eysen\" in the film), he remains the director of the Eisenstein Center, which used to be run out of his home. Among the dozens of well-used audio and film clips that Brandrup inserts with feeling and intuition are many shots from Eisenstein's revolutionary milestones like Strike and The Battleship Potemkin, but especially the second part of Ivan the Terrible. Stalin banned it over its depiction of his hero Ivan as a cruel dictator surrounded by boyar flunkies and ordered the material already shot on the third part destroyed. It is an apt comment on what is happening in today's Moscow. The parallel is there for those who wish to see it.\n\nSeveral interviewees point a finger at Mikhalkov as the villain of the piece, but his only appearance is at a press conference, spouting indignation that anyone could consider him an enemy of the Film Museum. Clearly the antagonism continues higher up in the Russian political hierarchy. Naum Kleiman, who is receiving the Berlinale Camera award this year, maintains a dignified stance above the sordid politics swirling around him and concludes by quoting Albert Einstein on the importance of never being afraid.", "If you want to understand Ukraine's crisis, you have to understand Russia - or at least its modern incarnation. Peter Pomerantsev, a native Russian speaker, spent nine years in Moscow and ended up doing just that. He arrived in 2001. Unusually, he wasn't a lawyer or a banker but a film-maker, a \"stowaway on the great armada of western civilisation\" that flowed into Moscow on a slick of abundant petrodollars.\n\nThe book is part Henry Fielding, part Dante: a Bildungsroman that morphs into something much darker. Pomerantsev begins life in Moscow as a na\u00eff. He goes to work for TNT, a television channel aimed at the young and hip. The book's theme is his journey through various circles of (a gilded) hell until he reaches a slow but complete awakening. Finally, he comes to understand Russia's profound moral disorder, its world of \"Maybachs and rapes and gangsters and mass graves and penthouses and sparkly dresses\".\n\nFor the first few years, everything was all right. Pomerantsev's brief was reality TV and he was good at it. From the world's heaviest boy and suicidal supermodels to the beautiful young girls attending academies that teach them to become the perfect mistress (\"Today we will learn the algorithm for receiving presents . . .\"), he filmed the strange stories emerging from this brave new world.\n\nAnd there were plenty of stories. Russia is the world's largest country. It has nine time zones and 144 million people, ranging from Bentley-driving oligarchs to village-dwelling peasants. TV, Pomerantsev explains, is the \"only force that can unify and rule and bind this country\". The first thing President Vladimir Putin (only ever referred to here as \"the president\") did on coming to power in 2000 was to seize control of it.\n\nThe move proved a wise one. TV has enabled the Kremlin to control its people in an age when death squads and the Gulag are no longer acceptable in a country seeking a global role. Authoritarianism is acceptable, especially when it is of the capitalist variety, but it must be packaged as something more palatable - Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin were so 20th century. TV gave the Kremlin everything it needed. It created puppet opposition parties so absurd that viewers (read: voters) could only conclude that, whatever his flaws, the president was the only sane choice. It allowed the government to combine propaganda with entertainment, dictatorship with ratings, totalitarianism with the language of democracy. Putin's Kremlin internalised the single, greatest lesson from the failure of communist rule: never let TV get boring.\n\nPomerantsev eventually understands all of this. He has various moments of anagnorisis but perhaps the best comes drunkenly in a Moscow nightclub:\n\nAt 5am the music goes faster and faster and in the throbbing, snowing light, the cattle become Forbeses [rich men] and the Forbeses' cattle [the girls chasing them], moving so fast now they can see the traces of themselves caught in the strobe across the dance floor. The guys and the girls look at themselves and think: \"Did that really happen to me? Is that me there?\"\n\nIt's all there in the billowing, streaming syntax. Their dancing is Pomerantsev's vertiginous world in miniature: the whirligig of modern Russia, where TV and politics are one and the president is the ultimate sugar daddy, where gangsters rue not running for parliament (\"They use the same methods as us\") and where rich men are finally no longer discernible from the hard-bodied women out to ensnare them.\n\nAnd why not? They all \"clambered out of one Soviet world\" to play their varying roles in the great scripted reality TV show that is modern Russia. It's a dystopian nightmare (endless police checks make Pomerantsev unconsciously pat his passport dozens of times a day), only one's face isn't being stamped on by a boot; it's watching a flat screen.\n\nAnd reality TV, like everything else in Russia, is in effect directed from the top. Here enter the \"political technologists\", Russia's modern grand viziers, the most prominent of whom is Vladislav Surkov, a kind of Cardinal Richelieu for the digital age. One of the authors of the new Russian system, Surkov, or those like him, created Putin \"from a no one, a grey fuzz, via the power of television\". Underlying Russia's war in Ukraine are Surkov's ideas. In his short story \"Without Sky\", he writes of \"non-linear war\" - a new type of conflict for a new age in which most understood the war to be \"part of a process . . . not necessarily its most important part\".\n\nAnd so it has proved in Ukraine, where Russia is accused of sending its hardware across the border to bomb and kill. No war has been declared and Moscow clearly has little interest in defeating Kyiv militarily (which it could do easily). Instead, the most vicious battles are conducted on TV and online as Putin seeks to promulgate a narrative: Ukrainians are evil, the west is decadent, Russia is holy and strong. He counts his victories not in casualties but in viewing and polling figures. It is war as political theatre: a truly postmodern conflict.\n\n\"All media,\" said the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan, \"are extensions of some human faculty - psychic or physical.\" During the many weeks I spent in eastern Ukraine, it was as if Putin's central nervous system were on display. The people I spoke to parroted fantastical mantras about Ukrainian fascists and Kyiv's desire to persecute Russian speakers that existed only on Russian TV: that is to say, in the Kremlin's imagination. The brilliance of Pomerantsev's hauntingly perceptive and beautifully written book is his understanding that in modern Russia, as in its war with Ukraine, reality is malleable.\n\nNowhere is this more true than in another of Russia's borderlands: Transnistria, the breakaway Moldovan republic that is the only \"country\" in the world not to have recognised the fall of the USSR. The author Rory MacLean and the photographer Nick Danziger tour this geopolitical oddity with \"New Soviet Man\" as their guide, a shady businessman, typical of the new breed of hyper-capitalist that has emerged since the USSR's collapse. A man who studies \"profit margins instead of the Great Path of the Party\", he is Homo Sovieticus reimagined as Donald Trump.\n\nAnd so the book roams across this surreal statelet, with beautiful photographs throughout. Its tone is jaunty and breezy - it grates somewhat. Laboured alliteration competes with strained comedy, most egregiously in the descent into the mock-heroic (\"Workers of Transnistria! Struggle for the further development and strengthening of our progressive alcohol industry!\").\n\nThe book's subject, however, is serious. Russia supports Transnistria by buying its main produce, alcohol, and supplies it with gas and large amounts of cash. It has 2,000 \"peacekeeping\" troops stationed there. Near the frontiers of the EU and Nato, it is of crucial geopolitical importance to the Kremlin, which perceives it as a bulwark against a hostile west. Putin is trying to make eastern Ukraine another Transnistria. It's not just a Soviet throwback; it's the future of Russian foreign policy.\n\nAs Russian-backed separatists now shell the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the prospect of a land corridor from Russia to the Crimea and into Transnistria is starting to look real. It would destroy the post-cold-war order. It barely seems imaginable but this is the post-Soviet space, where nothing is true and everything is indeed possible.", "Tehran, Feb 12, IRNA - Farhang Jahanpour of Oxford University's Faculty of Oriental Studies says that \"one difference between the Iranian revolution and recent revolutions in various Arab countries has been that the Iranian revolution benefited from charismatic leadership that managed to unite the people around a certain cause.\"\n\nJahanpour made the statement in an exclusive interview with Thursday's edition of 'Tehran Times', adding that 'most Arab revolutions have lacked a charismatic leader, and this may be one reason for their failure so far.\"\n\nJahanpour, a former dean of the Faculty of Foreign Languages at the University of Isfahan, also says, \"With recent developments in the world and in the region, and especially the flowering of democracies in many East European countries after the fall of the Soviet Union, as well as the example of the Iranian revolution, these factors have encouraged the Arab masses to rise up against the autocratic regimes and military dictatorships that ruled over them and to call for greater freedom, democracy, pluralism, and social equality.\"\n\nFollowing is the full text of the interview:\n\nQ: What were the main reasons behind the Iranian revolution?\n\nA: Ever since the middle of the 19th century many Iranians had tried to modernize and develop their country in order to save it from weakness and Western domination. In fact, the modernization in military fields had started under Abbas Mirza shortly after the disastrous wars with Russia, which resulted in the Gulistan Treaty in 1813 and the Turkmenchay Treaty in 1828, as the result of which Iran lost a huge chunk of its territory to the Russian Empire. However, Abbas Mirza died young and his reformist dreams remained unfulfilled. More comprehensive reforms were started by Amir Kabir in the middle of the 19th century, but he too fell victim to the envy of his rivals and anti-reform conservatives. He was deposed and killed in the Fin garden in Kashan on the orders of Nasir al-Din Shah.\n\nThe century-old struggle of Iranians for reform and democracy came to fruition with the Constitutional Revolution in 1905, but shortly afterwards with Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's death only 40 days after granting the Constitutional Law, his autocratic son Mohammad Ali Shah succeeded him, and the first phase of the constitutional movement came to an end. With the help of the Russian Colonel Vladimir Liakhov, the commander of the Cossack Brigade, he bombarded the Majles and executed several leaders of the Constitutional Revolution.\n\nHowever, many valiant Iranians from all over the country rose up against him and marched to Tehran and, against all odds, managed to re-establish the constitution in 1909. When one reads the literature of the period before and after the Constitutional Revolution one sees the strength and the depth of the desire for change and the Iranian longing for freedom and independence.\n\nHowever, before Iranians were able to enjoy the benefits of their hard-won freedom, the First World War broke out and British and Russian forces attacked Iran despite Iran's declared neutrality. The same story was repeated during the Second World War. Of course, the main aim of the occupation was to control Iranian oil and to prevent Germany from gaining access to it. It was again the control of oil that led to the 1953 coup organized by the MI6 and the CIA, after the Iranian oil industry had been nationalized by the Iranian Parliament and by the reformist Prime Minister Dr Mohammad Mosaddeq.\n\nAlthough during the 20th century Iran had made a great deal of progress in many fields, especially in health, education, light industries and standard of life, most people felt that they had not achieved political freedom or complete independence that they had been fighting for. The desire for freedom, independence and social justice were the three main motives behind the Iranian revolution.\n\nOf course, a revolution is merely a means for achieving an end, just as a ladder is used in order to climb to a higher floor.... What is necessary, especially now that Iran is celebrating the 36th anniversary of the revolution, is to make sure that the goals of the revolution, which were freedom, independence, social justice and the comprehensive development of the country, will be realized.\n\nThese goals are achievable. Iran has a young, educated and capable population. Iran also enjoys a unique geopolitical position and is blessed with vast natural resources. All that is needed is to remember the main goals of the revolution and to try to achieve them. The chaos in the region and the tragic experiences that most regional countries have gone through makes it imperative for Iranians to try to avoid those pitfalls...\n\nQ: Some argue that the recent Arab revolts have demonstrated what the people of the region want. They have indicated a post-modern moment away from grand ideologies, religious totalitarianism and other experiments of modernity. The Arab revolts were de-centralized, pluralistic, hybrid and they were geared towards the ideals of social equality, democracy and human rights. Hence the Arab revolts are not like the Iranian revolution in 1979. Do you agree?\n\nA: I believe that it is correct to say that most Arab uprisings had moved beyond grand ideologies and were mainly concerned with putting an end to despotism and religious totalitarianism, as well as achieving economic development. It should be borne in mind that Iran and Turkey were the two pioneers of modernization and democratization in the Middle East. Most Arab countries had not achieved the same level of democratic reform. Although there had been some stirrings of democratic reform in Egypt towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, nevertheless, the rise of religious totalitarianism and Arab nationalism prevented the full flowering of democratic sentiments in that country. The rest of the regional countries were even far behind Egypt.\n\nHowever, with recent developments in the world and in the region, and especially the flowering of democracies in many East European states after the fall of the Soviet Union, as well as the example of the Iranian revolution, these factors have encouraged the Arab masses to rise up against the autocratic regimes and military dictatorships that ruled over them and to call for greater freedom, democracy, pluralism, and social equality.\n\nAlthough, unfortunately, some of those movements in a number of Arab countries, especially in Libya, Syria and Egypt, have not achieved the desired results, nevertheless, it is inconceivable that after their awakening the people in those countries could be suppressed forever. Consequently, it is only a matter of time before they will rise up again, and will try to move in step with the rest of the world towards greater democracy and development.\n\nQ: How much did the Iranian revolution in 1979 inspire liberation movements in the world?\n\nA: Without doubt, the Iranian revolution was one of the most important developments in the past century, and it can only be compared with the Russian and French revolutions in the sense of the change that it brought about. The Iranian revolution proved that if people rise up in large numbers to achieve a great goal, they can overcome the overwhelming force of the military and the paraphernalia of despotism.\n\nWhat was more important about it was that it was a regional revolution and was largely home-grown. Consequently, it had a great impact on regional countries and inspired the liberation movements in the region and perhaps in the world. It can even achieve greater status and influence if it can live up to the dreams of the people who supported the revolution and realize the ideals that they held dear, namely greater democracy, freedom, independence and social justice.\n\nQ: What was the role of Ayatollah Khomeini in the victory of the revolution?\n\nA: One difference between the Iranian revolution and recent revolutions in various Arab countries has been that the Iranian revolution benefited from charismatic leadership that managed to unite the people around a certain cause. Most Arab revolutions have lacked a charismatic leader, and this may be one reason for their failure so far.\n\n**1425", "Our political institutions, the rule of law, human rights, the banking system, our education system - and even capitalism itself - are products of the industrial age. Technology will transform them all within a generation. By Lene Rachel Andersen and Steen Rasmussen.\n\nThroughout history, whenever new technologies have emerged that change our means of production and ability to communicate they have tended to transform society. The rapid technological development of the past century -- in biotechnology, IT, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence -- holds the promise to do the same for our post-industrial world.\n\nOur political institutions, the rule of law, human rights, the banking system, our education system -- and even capitalism itself -- are products of the industrial age. We have learnt to navigate the industrial economy as individuals, and as societies we can exert some control to define its shape and limits.\n\nBut what comes next, in a post-industrial world? Even in the past decade, digital products and services, the Internet and mobile technology have changed our lives. This is the result of accumulated advances over the past 50 years; there is much more to come. For example, recent studies indicate that digitisation is likely to replace about half of known jobs within 20 years.\n\nIn the industrial economy, more was better -- but now this is not always the case. The developed world is sick from overeating, while greater productivity leads to cheaper goods and greater consumption, which squanders Earth's resources ever faster and fosters a wasteful, consumption-based economy. Instead, a future economy would strive to provide a world of plenty, with virtually no waste.\n\nIt is the convergence of cutting-edge biotech, infotech, nanotech, and cognitive sciences (Binc) that will be at the heart of the living and intelligent technologies of tomorrow.\n\nAs technology becomes more lifelike more components can be recycled, in the same way that materials are within biological systems. Thanks to automation, only a small percentage of the population will be needed to produce and distribute what everybody needs. For example, today only about 2% of the Danish population is engaged in agriculture and fishery, down from almost everybody some 150 years ago -- and these 2% can feed several countries the size of Denmark. With the development of personal fabricators -- super-advanced 3D printers -- it's likely citizens will be able to design, manufacture and recycle pretty much everything they need at home.\n\nThe Binc technologies are likely to lead to big changes in society, just as computerisation has been the driving force for the past 50 years. This could be as drastic as the differences between the Stone Age and the Bronze Age, or from agricultural society to the scientific age of industry. Inevitably, such a shift leads to changes in economic and political systems, national sovereignty, balances of power, the environment, the human condition, even religion. But this time the changes will not take place over hundreds of years, but within a generation or so.\n\nWhat is bringing about this change now? We believe four interacting patterns indicate what is underway.\n\n1. A digital economy\n\nThe digital economy is fundamentally different. Digital products and services account for an increasing part of the economy, yet only the first unit requires capital and labour -- subsequent digital copies are practically free of cost. Such digitisation and automation removes more jobs than it creates, driving demand for highly skilled individuals and competition for scarcer middle and low-grade jobs. With virtually none of the transportation costs you would get with physical products, on the Internet such products are immediately global, and the best product takes all -- look at the dominance of Facebook, Google and Microsoft over their rivals.\n\n2. An eroding middle class and democracy\n\nAs recently documented by Thomas Piketty, the erosion of the middle class in all developed economies. The gap between the middle class and the super-rich widens, concentrating wealth and political power among the elites. In today's financial economy, there is greater return on investment in speculation than in production; being rich is a surer path to wealth than working.\n\nWith about half of middle class jobs disappearing, nation states will lose much of their tax revenue. Unless we radically rethink taxation, this will fundamentally change the economic foundation upon which democratic states are governed.\n\nAs economic and political elites converge, political power is concentrated in progressively fewer hands. This power grab is supported by the information infrastructure, through which citizens' personal data can be monitored and accessed, eroding privacy, civil and democratic rights.\n\n3. One world\n\nGlobal challenges are beyond the powers of individual nations. For example, the CO generated in one country affects the entire planet; there is only one environment -- and the transition to a sustainable energy system must be a global one.\n\nAs information, people and capital travel with increasing freedom around the world, the planet is gradually redefined from some 200 national economies to one global economy, for which there is no common law. Businesses can re-home themselves in low- or no-tax states -- this leads to a race to the bottom with competing nations cutting corporate tax rates even as income tax revenues dwindle. Single states will no longer be able to take care of their citizens alone.\n\nAs nations become more interconnected, this will also lead to difficulties in how to align their often radically different economic, cultural and governmental structures -- for example, between traditional Arabic, industrial Russian and modern, digitised Scandinavian.\n\n4. The need for new narratives\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw the struggle between capital and workers play out across the left-right political spectrum, but today this distinction is weak. In the West, there is some broad agreement based around a vision of the open society, a liberal democracy, market economy and public welfare. But in other regions of the world, any such broad agreement is around different, even contradictory concepts.\n\nTechnological change is so rapid that it has outstripped political and legal frameworks, changing the way the economy or even society works before the law can catch up. The converging Binc technologies will accelerate this process into something we have difficulty imagining. And as yet there are no global institutions that can handle this transformation.\n\nThe grand narratives which used to keep societies together -- religion, nation and class -- are losing their power to guide and explain the world, and are sometimes used for the support of totalitarian regimes. In fact, the only grand narrative that has survived is \"the free market\": it can provide consumer goods efficiently, but it is incapable of solving any of our current problems. If anything, it fuels them.\n\nThe new Binc age\n\nTo create sustainable economies, preserve human dignity and avoid social conflict, these issues must be at the forefront of national and international politics. In a world in which knowledge is viewed as an indisputable asset, we must put it to work to understand this global transformation and develop sustainable paths for the future. Continuing to cling to the belief that only free markets and nation states will resolve our current dilemmas is na\u00efve. We need to recognise reality as it is -- not as it once was.\n\nWith the right political, legal and economic structures and institutions in place, the convergence of Binc technologies can promise meaningful work, leisure time, prosperity and freedom for all. Conversely, apathy and avarice could see this transition bring our world into a new dark age, a dystopia controlled by a tiny elite.", "The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the opinions of WrestlingInc or its staff.\n\nEver since Frank Gotch wrestled George Hackenschmidt in their famed rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship in front of 30,000 fans in Chicago's Comiskey Park in 1911, wrestling has been about the big event. 99% of the wrestling calendar is filled with smaller events, some of them mattering significantly, while others barely at all. In the grand scope of things, they are all just fodder for the big event.\n\nBut what wrestling event was truly the biggest? What massive events remain significant years after they happened? The main telling point is attendance. If we are truly calculating what event had the largest audience, then the answer is Wrestlemania 28, with its 1.27 million PPV purchases, it was the most widely seen wrestling event in history. But, Wrestlemania 28 had some modern advantages, including marketing, the increase in PPV availability, and a variety of other things. To compare events from across different eras, it makes more sense to compare attendance figures. While attendance figures are controversial and wrestling promoters are famous for inflating their total beyond reality, it at least creates a generally level playing field in which to compare events from different eras.\n\nBy sheer numerical supremacy, WCW and New Japan Pro Wrestling's supershow Collision in Korea, is the biggest event of all-time. The actual attendance figure for the second day of the event (the larger of the two) is debatable, but even the most modest of expectations put it at 160,000, making it far larger than any other event in history. However, it is debatable on whether Collision in Korea should really be considered for largest wrestling event.\n\nFirst, the event took place in North Korea, as part of the two-day International Sports and Cultural Festival for Peace in 1995. Wrestling was the main attraction to the event, but it was also a patriotic rally for North Korea. For one of the few times in North Korean history, western entertainers were coming to the isolated country. The event was accompanied by massive military demonstrations and all sorts of propaganda expounding North Korea's dominance over the West. It was one of the only times in the nation's history that its citizens could enjoy a Western (or in Japan's case, Eastern) form of entertainment, so of course people poured into the massive May Day Stadium (an arena that was originally constructed for massive demonstrations of appreciation for Kim Il-Sung and his family) to watch the event. It was more of a manifestation of citizens living in a totalitarian government, a wrestling event just happened to also be going on.\n\nThe event also doesn't quite measure up to other top contenders when it came to the impact it had on the wrestling world. The card was uneventful except for the main event, when Antonio Inoki defeated Ric Flair, and WCW cared so little about this event that they didn't even bother airing it until four months after it took place. Comparing that to historically significant shows like Wrestlemania III and The Inoki Final, it isn't even close.\n\nMoving beyond Collision in Korea, the next contender would be Wrestlemania III, when a reputed 93,173 filed into the Pontiac Silverdome. This number is widely disputed, mainly by Dave Meltzer, who claims that the events promoter, Zane Bresloff, told him that the real attendance was around 78,000, and that the WWE and Vince McMahon inflated the numbers so that they would set the indoor attendance record. The fact that WWE would inflate the attendance numbers wouldn't be surprising, and it is very interesting that arenas that have had similar set-ups haven't even come close to touching the 93,000 mark. Mainly, Summerslam 1992, which was held in a larger stadium and similar set-up to Wrestlemania III (there was not massive stage walling off a section of seats like in today's WWE events) and only drew 80,355, despite a sell-out crowd. On the other hand, the Silverdome had 80,000 seats for Detroit Lions games, and considering the smaller size of a wrestling ring, it is not inconceivable that 13,000 seats could be added. In addition Pope John Paul II's sermon given at the Silverdome just a few months after Wrestlemania III drew 93,682, so it is very plausible that there really were that many people at Wrestlemania III.\n\nThere are a few other WWE claimants to the title. Wrestlemania 29 at MetLife Stadium and Wrestlemania 23 at Ford Field in Detroit also drew around 80,000, putting them in the running.\n\nIn Japan, the Tokyo Dome has hosted more major events than any other venue in history, but it just lacks the overall size to matchup with some of its rivals. The largest crowd ever in Japan was for The Inoki Final, the culmination of a four year retirement tour for Antonio Inoki. Around 77,000 people filled the Tokyo Dome to see Inoki defeat Don Frye in four minutes in his final match. The Tokyo Dome can at least claim the record for the largest wrestling crowd to see an event that mainly featured women's wrestling, as an estimated 42,500 came out to see All-Japan Women's Wrestling and their landmark show AJW Doumu Super Woman Great War ~ Big Egg Wrestling Universe.\n\nUp until this point, we have dealing with mostly modern wrestling events, with relatively stable attendance numbers. Moving backwards in time, there are several major events that could be the largest in wrestling history, but their attendance figures become increasing harder to prove. Perhaps most puzzling is the reputed 100,000 attendance figure that the Great Gama ran up at the National Polo Grounds in Karachi, Pakistan in 1949. The fact that it is hard to figure out who Gama even wrestled should be telling enough, and let's face it, attendance figures for pro wrestling matches in 1940's Pakistan are going to be pretty fishy. I have no doubt a lot of people showed up for this event, but it would be impossible to state the exact number with any certainty. Staying in that area, Arjit Singh of India met Lebanon's Sheik Ali in 1960 in New Delhi for a match that reportedly drew 80,000. This number might have a little more trustworthy value than the previous one, but it is still suspect.\n\nLastly, we turn back the clock one final time to what I personally believe should be thought of as the largest wrestling event of all-time. On September 20th, 1933, Jim Londos (statistically the greatest attendance draw in wrestling history) traveled back to his native Greece and wrestled an obscure wrestler by the name Kola Kwariani in front of a reported 110,000 fans in Athens. As many as 30,000 more spectators were turned away from the stadium, and Londos would wrestle Kwariani again a few nights later in front of another 60,000.\n\nWhile the numbers are always going to be questioned, I believe the 110,000 for a few reasons. First, Londos had been a top draw all over the world for nearly the last two decades, and was finally coming back to the country he left when he ran away from home when he was 13 years old. Secondly, Londos, who was nicknamed The Golden Greek, was a national hero during a very trying time in Greece. Lastly, the event took place in a recognizable venue that had the sheer size to hold such a crowd. Panathenaic Stadium was the main stadium utilized in the 1896 revival of the Olympics and had a capacity in the 1930s around 100,000. If they jammed a few more Greeks in there when there was such a demand, it wouldn't shock me.\n\nThe big events in wrestling are what make the product all worthwhile. They are the ones we remember forever and that make impressions on us that affect the way we feel about the medium for the rest of our lives. Wrestling is all about the perception and not the reality, and the events with the largest crowds tend to give the perception that they are the most important, most significant events that have ever taken place. In wrestling, bigger is always better.\n\nHere are my star ratings from New Japan's New Beginning in Osaka PPV:\n\nSho Tanaka vs Yohei Komatsu-**1/2\n\nMascara Dorada and Tiger Mask vs Captain New Japan and Manabu Nakanishi-**1/4\n\nJushin Thuder Liger and Hiroyoshi Tenzan vs Chase Owens and Rob Conway-**1/4\n\nKazuchika Okada, Toru Yano and Kazushi Sakuraba vs Bad Luck Fale, Yujio Takahashi and Tama Tonga-**1/2\n\nYOSHI-HASHI, Tomohiro Ishii and Shinsuke Nakamura vs Tetsuya Naito, Yuji Nagata and Satoshi Kojima-***1/4\n\nKarl Anderson and Doc Gallows vs Katsuyori Shibata and Hirooki Goto-***3/4", "Russia's alleged tactics in the Ukraine conflict including covert military action and social media campaigns could inspire other nations such as China and Iran, a top defence think-tank warned Wednesday.\n\nMost armies around the world are ill-prepared for this new type of \"hybrid warfare\", the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in its annual Military Balance report covering 171 countries.\n\nIt said NATO should act with \"urgency\" to develop responses to such threats, which had the potential to \"rapidly destabilise\" Western states.\n\nThe study said Moscow had waged \"limited war for limited objectives\" in Ukraine while maintaining a \"deniability\" which had confused the West's response.\n\nRussia denies supplying troops and weapons to rebels in Ukraine.\n\nAs the United States considers whether to send arms to Ukraine, it also detailed how Kiev's armed forces had been \"hollowed out\" by low investment and were largely reliant on Soviet-era equipment.\n\nBy contrast, Russia's defence budget is set to rise from 2.1 trillion rubles ($31.6 billion dollars, 27.9 billion euros) in 2013 to 3.29 trillion rubles this year, the IISS said.\n\nAs well as Ukraine, the report, released in London, turned the spotlight on the Islamic State group and North Korea's plans to develop an inter-continental ballistic missile.\n\n- 'Global ramifications' -\n\nThe report said Russia was waging a form of war in Ukraine which combined low-level conventional and special operations with campaigns on social media to shape public opinion.\n\nSuch tactics represent a \"grave threat to NATO's collective security\" because they operate \"in grey areas that exploit seams in the alliance,\" it said.\n\nTheir effect could also spread further than Ukraine.\n\n\"Policymakers may anticipate that some current or potential state or non-state adversaries, possibly including states such as China and Iran, will learn from Russia's recent deployment of hybrid warfare,\" the report said.\n\n\"These lessons might not necessarily be applied in conflicts with Western states but their potential to rapidly destabilise the existing order could, if applied in other zones of political and military competition, mean they have global ramifications.\"\n\nSome of the media tactics employed by IS jihadists in Iraq and Syria, including using social media to recruit fighters, had \"thematic similarities\" with those used in Ukraine, the study said.\n\nIt warned that Western armies, many emerging from a 13-year war in Afghanistan and facing squeezed budgets, were still focused on fighting conflicts using more conventional tactics.\n\nGiven the threat, they should be looking at how to counter enemy propaganda as well as gathering intelligence and improving the readiness of military forces, the IISS said.\n\nBy contrast, groups such as IS thrive on their flexibility.\n\n\"The hybrid, adaptable nature of ISIS (another term for IS) -- part insurgency, part light infantry and part-time terrorist group -- proved key to its advances,\" the report said.\n\n- N. Korea missile 'advances' -\n\nIn Asia, the development of China's military has increased in importance under President Xi Jinping as it faces a string of territorial disputes and seeks to deter US deployments in the region, according to the IISS.\n\nChina's defence spending now accounts for 38 percent of the total for Asia, up from 28 percent in 2010. The country's overall defence budget rose 12.2 percent last year.\n\n\"Beijing's military ambition is aimed at providing at least regional power projection and a conventional deterrent capacity to discourage external intervention,\" the report said.\n\nThis comes amid a tougher posture on defence in Japan, underpinned by a 2.2 percent increase in defence spending last year after a decade of virtually stagnant military budgets.\n\nNorth Korea, the totalitarian hermit state led by Kim Jong-Un, has meanwhile made \"significant advances\" in its rocket and non-conventional weapons capabilities, according to the study.\n\nThe IISS highlighted that the eight months from February to September last year \"involved the most intense rocket and missile testing the nation has ever conducted\".\n\nIt added that \"continued advances\" in Pyongyang's quest for an inter-continental ballistic missile caused greatest concern but stressed the age of the country's defence material.\n\n\"North Korea remains reliant on a predominantly obsolescent equipment inventory,\" the report said.\n\n\"The extent to which dependency on this equipment affects morale is difficult to assess -- but it likely has an effect.\"", "With the absence of state aid estimates from the Governor's Office, Iroquois officials didn't want to estimate a budget figure at the district's Feb. 5 budget forum because they knew it would be false.\n\n\"This is the first year we don't have a projected run.

The GEA was first introduced in the 2010-11 fiscal year.\n\nBoard President Charles Specht said school districts would be better off without the GEA.\n\n\"If you take a look at all the budgets we've done in the past over that five-year period and what the increases were, we would not have had to experience any kind of tax increase if not for that [GEA], and that's why it's so important that our legislators start speaking up for us and get rid of that,\" Specht said.\n\nAdditionally, the state hasn't released specific amounts of money each district will receive from the Smart Schools Bond Act.\n\nBusiness Administrator Joanne George said if Gov. Cuomo and the Legislature don't come to an agreement about his proposed education reforms, the governor has stated that total state aid for the 2015-16 and 2016-17 school years won't exceed the aid distributed in the 2014-15 school year.\n\nScofield said it is impossible to be transparent to the public during budget development without the state aid calculations, and any revenue projections will be inaccurate at best.\n\n\"We just don't know. If I was to throw a number up there and say 'this is where it'll be,' it wouldn't even be close. It could be off by half a million dollars, which is a lot of money,\" Scofield said.\n\nSpecht added that he believes the turmoil surrounding Cuomo's reforms has more to do with a political agenda than trying to help students.\n\n\"It's hurting no one but our kids,\" Specht said. \"If we're not here for the education of our kids, then what are we here for? If we stand by and watch what's going on in education right now and do nothing, then we should just pack our bags and not show up here.\"\n\nTrustee David Lowery had a suggestion for what the board should do if it doesn't receive state aid estimates by April 1.\n\n\"We put up a real high budget and tell everyone to vote no,\" Lowery said. \"Then on the second time, we will have real numbers.\"\n\nScofield added that there aren't any big changes planned for next year. In addition to protecting current programs, the district plans to implement 40-minute periods for middle and intermediate school students to offer a greater opportunity for acceleration.

Personally knowing Eaton, I know that his observations on Cuba are based on first-person knowledge. Eaton, as a photo-journalist connected with Flagler College, has been in and out of Cuba for decades. After more than 50 years of alienation and U.S.-imposed embargo, which did not work to remove the Castro regime, Cuba seems to stand still.\n\nIt is a wonder how America could have a double-standard with when it comes to relationships with dictators and totalitarian countries. As a Filipino, I know for a fact that America had unrestricted diplomatic and trade relations with the Philippines during the more than two decades of the most corrupt conjugal dictatorship of Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos. It took a people's peaceful revolution led by the Catholic Church and military that \"America's\" dictator was toppled in 1986.\n\nEven now, America has normal relations with China, which has known human rights violations. U.S. relations have long been opened with Vietnam, another Communist country. Terrorist havens like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen have normal relations with America.\n\nOur relation with Putin's Russia may be strained, but it is intact. Saudi Arabia, which is an absolute monarchy, is our ally.\n\nThough I do not find any sense why some politicians, even Cuban-Americans like Sen.

My problem with this memorial is not that it commemorates those victims, but that it ignores the other side of this story - the victims of anti-communist, totalitarian regimes. The Cold War was a geopolitical contest between two superpowers and their allies. Ideology played a role in this contest, but it did not guide it.\n\nTo define it as a battle between capitalist liberal democracy and totalitarian Marxism-Leninism ignores too many factors. Namely, that the United States aligned itself with numerous, ruthless and totalitarian dictatorships. One of these, Portugal, was even a founding member of NATO, despite being led by a fascist dictator, Antonio Salazar. The narrative that the Iron Curtain separated the oppressed from those who enjoyed freedom ignores the repressive nature of anti-communist dictatorships in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, Guatemala, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nicaragua, Panama, Honduras, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, Rhodesia, Zaire, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Vietnam, Pakistan and other places. All of these aforementioned dictatorships murdered thousands of their own citizens in the name of combating communism (often with tacit Western backing). Indonesia's chief thug, General Suharto, butchered more than 600,000 of his own people.\n\nWhy not also memorialize their victims? Because that would not support the narrative of the Cold War that we in the West like to remember: good guys vs. bad guys. This narrative does not take into account how complex and confusing the Cold War often was. The United States supported communist regimes that were quarrelling with other, pro-Moscow, communist regimes (Somalia, Yugoslavia and after the Vietnamese invasion, even the Khmer Rouge to an extent). The Soviets sometimes supported anti-communist dictators when their interests appeared to align (Saddam Hussein and Muamar al Gaddafi come to mind), they also had friendly relations with some democratic nations (India and Finland, for example). We think of Eastern Europe as a bastion of totalitarian repression during the Cold War, but we forget that most of the nations in our own backyard (Latin America) had it just as bad, and at times worse.\n\nThose who were tortured or killed under Suharto, Zia, Pinochet, Somoza, Chaing Kai Shek, Dinh Diem, or Franco deserve to be remembered just as much as the victims of Ceasescu, Stalin, Honecker and Mao. Students should learn about both Vaclav Havel and Victor Jara; when we think of the Cold War, we should not only remember the Gulag and the Berlin Wall, but also Spain's concentration camps and the Guatemalan genocide. These are not only footnotes. Even before the Cold War, Europe and Latin America were dominated by anti-communist, autocratic regimes (aside from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) which also had horrendous human rights records.\n\nCommemorating only the victims of communism is an injustice to the victims of anti-communist totalitarianism. This myopia also smacks of ideological motivation. If we can commemorate as broad and diverse a phenomena as communism, then why not totalitarianism instead?\n\nChris Gilmore, Ottawa", "The latest crop of 300 new North Korean slogans to mark North Korea's 70th anniversary has just been released.

If the desperate practices of implanting the \"correct\" views in children outside their families applied by the totalitarian regimes had been successful, Germany would have been full of Nazis now and all Czechs would have been happy Bolsheviks, Zv\u011b\u0159ina writes.\n\nChl\u00e1dek dares to say that home schooling is a hotbed of extreme ideologies. Is he planning to send ideological inspector to families for checks? Zv\u011b\u0159ina asks.\n\nThis idea is not as exaggerated as it may seem, given that Chl\u00e1dek wants to check what children eat at schools and demand strict punishment for parents who don't want their children to be vaccinated, Zv\u011b\u0159ina writes.\n\nThe Czech Social Democrats have been trying to have an image of a modern European party. They take away freedoms, but plan to give them back in the form of pseudo-freedoms and suspicious rights that they consider modern and trendy, ignoring that this limits the space for freedom of the majority population, Zv\u011b\u0159ina writes.\n\nApart from private, church, foreign-language or Waldorf schools, home schooling has become a form that is allowed under strict state supervision in the CzechRepublic. The results of home schooling in junior primary schools are very good. Thanks to this, it was expected to be extended to senior primary schools - under clearly set rules and only for some children, of course, Zv\u011b\u0159ina writes.\n\nThe opponents of the extended home schooling have no argument against it, he adds.\n\n\"It is too late to find out after nine years of home schooling that the child is completely unprepared. The child's life has already been ruined,\" Zv\u011b\u0159ina quotes Chl\u00e1dek as saying.\n\nThis statement is absolute nonsense, Zv\u011b\u0159ina points out.\n\nOne has to ask how come that there are Czech youths who attended primary schools, yet are illiterate and fail to integrate into society. If schools were so powerful and the influence of family so weak, such youths should not exist, Zv\u011b\u0159ina writes.\n\nChl\u00e1dek should pay attention to these students because their number is higher than that of children who are taught by their parents at home instead of going to school, Zv\u011b\u0159ina writes.\n\nThe lower house of parliament today passed an amendment to the law on schools. The right-wing opposition MPs failed to push through that home schooling be possible for students of senior primary schools, although the lower house school committee recommended it.\n\nBut MP Ji\u0159\u00ed Mihola (Christian Democrats, KDU-\u010cSL) said the government coalition did not reach an agreement on this issue and would deal with it again.", "This article appeared on National Interest (Online) on February 12, 2015.\n\nIt's hard to get out of a bad relationship. The good times may be over and the once vibrant connection may be dead, but people just can't admit that it's time to say goodbye.\n\nCountries have the same problem, especially the U.S. Washington has spent decades collecting allies like many people accumulate Facebook \"Friends.\" Virtually never, irrespective of the changed circumstances, does America drop an ally. Indeed, the less relevant the ties the more insistent U.S. officials become in demanding that the relationship be \"strengthened\" and \"expanded.\"\n\nWith Valentine's Day almost upon us, the Obama administration should take an unsparing look at the ever-growing crowd of American allies and ally-wannabes. It's time for Washington to send the equivalent of a \"Dear John\" letter to a half dozen foreign capitals.\n\nWhere to start? There are so many undeserving deadbeat friends.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nU.S. officials make much of shared values while issuing military guarantees and writing lavish checks to scores of nations. No one can mistake Saudi Arabia as a country that America has much in common with other than commerce in oil and the occasional common enemy, such as Osama bin Laden.\n\nHowever, no alliance is necessary for the two states to cooperate when their interests coincide. Indeed, the Saudis must sell oil to survive: they will cash anyone's check, friend or foe. And when the monarchy is under threat, it will respond vigorously, even ruthlessly, without outside prodding.\n\nWhen it comes to values, Riyadh is an extraordinary embarrassment to the United States. Essentially a totalitarian state, the monarchy plunders people, brutalizes political opposition, suppresses religious expression, and even exports Sunni tyranny -- to next door Bahrain, for instance. The late King Abdullah was hailed as a moderate and modernizer, but that was only in the context of one of the least free societies on earth. And his successor King Salman seems determined to halt if not reverse the minuscule progress of the last two decades.\n\nIt's time send Riyadh a text message breaking up. The two governments can still cooperate where appropriate. But there should be no more presidential visits to pay respectful obeisance to the Saudi throne. There should be no more intimate, hand-holding meetings at the president's retreat. The U.S. military no longer should be treated as an inexpensive bodyguard for the al-Saud family, ready to do Riyadh's bidding.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nIf ever there was an alliance made irrelevant by circumstances, it is America's defense guarantee for the Republic of Korea. The two nations share some values -- at least since Seoul finally moved to democracy, despite Washington's long-running support for South Korean dictators. But extensive cultural, economic, and family ties will endure irrespective of the security relationship.\n\nThe U.S. was drawn into war in Korea not because of the peninsula's intrinsic strategic importance -- before the conflict even Gen. Douglas MacArthur dismissed the land's geopolitical relevance. Rather, Washington bore some responsibility for the war, having divided the peninsula with the Soviets and refused to arm the fledgling state. As for security, U.S. policymakers mistakenly saw the North Korean attack as a calculated move by Joseph Stalin, perhaps a prelude to an attack on Europe.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades collecting allies like many people accumulate Facebook 'Friends.'\"\n\nThen American troops were required on the peninsula until the South gained both political stability and economic development. However, by the 1980s the ROK had raced well ahead of North Korea economically. By the 1990s, Seoul had embraced democracy and the North's Cold War allies had also been transformed; there was no prospect of Russian or Chinese aid for renewed North Korean aggression. Today South Korea enjoys a 40:1 economic lead, 2:1 population edge, vast technological superiority and overwhelming diplomatic support.\n\nThe ROK's reliance on American defense subsidies is a little like Washington begging Europe for support against Mexico. The South can defend itself. Some Americans imagine Seoul joining a grand alliance to contain China, but South Koreans would have to be mad to make the great power next door a permanent enemy by taking Washington's side in disagreements with little relevance to the ROK (Taiwan, Spratly Islands, Senkaku Islands). Other forms of cooperation, such as intelligence sharing, might be beneficial, but could be conducted without a \"Mutual Defense Treaty,\" which is mutual in name only.\n\nIraq\n\nThe Bush administration's invasion of Iraq was based on a number of illusions, starting with the presence of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. officials also believed as a matter of faith that the Iraqis would create a liberal, nonsectarian democracy, recognize Israel, offer America bases for use against Shia Iran, and join America in the grand march toward a socially progressive future. Alas, it was all an extended nightmare -- a series of bizarre fantasies which cost 4,500 Americans and upwards of 200,000 Iraqis their lives.\n\nA classic form of blowback was the rise of the Islamic State. In disposing of the secular dictator Saddam Hussein, the U.S. triggered a bitter sectarian war. The majority Shia finally gained political dominance, but their brutality encouraged dispossessed Sunnis to turn to the Islamic State for protection. Now Washington is back at war on behalf of a nominal ally, which brought distress upon itself and many others.\n\nThere's not much chance that the two countries will share values. Iraq lacks democratic traditions, civic institutions, and tolerant philosophies. That doesn't mean no one there is interested in building a more liberal society. But public attitudes in America and Iraq remain very different and aren't likely to converge any time soon.\n\nNor is there much strategic agreement. Baghdad's relations with Iran will always be one of the heart. Those with America will always be one of convenience. The Shia authorities overreached and are in danger of losing their country. Call in the Americans! Yet the force threatening Iraq, the Islamic State, poses no particular danger to America. And joining with Baghdad has entangled the U.S. in a sectarian war on behalf of radical Shiites, some of whom continue to kill Iraqi Sunnis.\n\nBetter to make the relationship purely transactional. Should the U.S. provide weapons or training to the Iraqi military? It depends on whether doing so makes sense at a particular time and in a particular circumstance. Cooperate when advantageous to do so, but maintain distance otherwise. There should be no pretense of a sustained allied relationship.\n\nThe Baltic Trio\n\nEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania live in a bad neighborhood. Long part of the Russian Empire, and later swallowed by the Soviet Union after a short stint of independence, they now living fearfully in Moscow's shadow. Today the three are demanding the presence of NATO troops, meaning American forces, and constant \"reassurance\" that Washington is prepared to go to war for them.\n\nThe expansion of the NATO alliance to the Baltics is a good example of how Washington forgot what alliances are supposed to be. Most countries choose allies in order to strengthen their own security. In the aftermath of World War II, the U.S. feared Soviet domination of Eurasia and created NATO as a shield behind which Western Europe could revive.\n\nThe policy worked -- perhaps too well, as the alliance's European members chose to take a cheap ride on America even after they had recovered and jumped ahead economically. With the end of the Cold War there was no reason to expand an alliance that had lost its raison d'etre. Whatever security issues remained could have been handled by the Europeans, whether through a continental alliance as a successor to NATO or a European-led NATO. Bringing in the Baltics provided a dramatic example of adding countries which were security black holes -- weak states with minimal military capability but potential conflicts with Russia.\n\nToday only Estonia meets NATO's recommended two percent of GDP, itself a paltry level for a country screaming about the possibility of an invasion by the big bully next door. Latvia and Lithuania spend half that, but promise to eventually get up to two percent. Never mind, say the Baltics: America, if you please -- despite being very busy around the world -- put troops along their border and protect them.\n\nIt's probably not realistic to kick the Baltic States out of NATO, but then, the real problem for America is NATO, not particular members of it. Washington should drop out of the alliance, forging a set of more limited military cooperation agreements with the European Union and the European nations with the most potent militaries and significant bases. Needless to say, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania would not be on that list.\n\nPhilippines\n\nAmerica has long had a tortured relationship with this semi-failed Pacific state. The United States first grabbed it as part of William McKinley's imperialistic expansion toward China -- the Pacific Ocean made it contiguous claimed the bombastic Sen. Albert Beveridge, the political tribune of imperialism. America had to suppress a vigorous independence movement that had been active against colonial Spain. Some 200,000 Filipinos died as part of this early example of \"democracy\" promotion.\n\nEventually granted independence, the nation was overrun by Japan during World War II. Since being freed the Philippines has politically sputtered through dictatorship, corrupt and incompetent democracy, and various other odd mixtures, such as the military elevating a vice president over a president. Long-running insurgencies by radical Islamic groups have undermined what little stability the country offered.\n\nManila's military reflects this flawed foundation. One defense minister complained of a navy which couldn't sail and an air force which couldn't fly. Indeed, the navy's flagship is an American cast-off. Yet the Philippines wants to challenge China over the Scarborough Shoal and other areas of the South China Sea.\n\nMore accurately, Manila wants the U.S. to do so. A couple decades after closing America's major bases, and kicking the U.S. military out of the country, last year the Philippines negotiated a new status of forces agreement for visiting U.S. troops with the all-too-obvious desire of entangling the friendly superpower in the local maritime dispute -- in which Washington has no interest. The U.S. would prefer that the region's territorial squabbles be settled peacefully, but has no reason to step in between a country unwilling to do anything serious on its own behalf and a rising great power willing to do too much. Dear Manila, should run the letter written by President Barack Obama.\n\nUkraine\n\nTechnically Kiev is not a U.S. ally, but you wouldn't know it from how the administration is treating Ukraine, and especially how the usual gaggle of neoconservative and hyper-nationalist hawks wants to treat Ukraine. Nor from how the government in Kiev wants to be treated by America.\n\nUkraine was dealt a tough hand by history and geography. It has long suffered under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, with only brief moments of freedom, but has never mattered much to the U.S. While Ukraine was considered a \"captive nation\" during the Cold War, no American strategist ever argued that Moscow's control over that land implicated serious let alone vital interests. So too after Kiev finally broke free nearly a quarter century ago.\n\nThe U.S. signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum after Ukraine divested its nuclear weapons, but the agreement offered only platitudes -- promising to go to the United Nations if another power threatened Kiev with the use of nuclear weapons, for instance. Washington's meddling in 2004 and 2005 helped bring Viktor Yushchenko to power, but he proved to be erratic, incompetent, and out of touch with his own people. The current administration's promotion of last year's street putsch backfired even more disastrously on both America and Ukraine, leading Russia to sever Crimea and back separatists in the Donbas.\n\nWhile one can understand why Ukrainians -- like the Baltic peoples -- want America to send in the cavalry, Washington has no reason to do so. The struggle is tragic, but complex, mixing civil war and foreign intervention. Everything the administration accuses Russia of doing America has done, including launch invasions, back insurgents, and destabilize governments. Ukraine is irrelevant to American security, certainly not important enough to warrant confrontation with a nuclear-armed power in its front yard. Ukraine always will matter much more to Russia, which will pay far higher costs and take far greater risks to prevail.\n\nThe U.S. should make clear that Kiev will never be in NATO, nor will there ever be American troops in Ukraine. Washington will not give weapons to Kiev. America's economic, cultural, and humanitarian interests in Ukraine are real but limited. Whatever the bilateral relationship in the future, it will not be an alliance.\n\nSince becoming convinced that it was the globe's essential power, America has had trouble saying no. It doesn't much matter who, but when Albania, Romania, Afghanistan, Montenegro, Georgia, and a long line of others come calling, Washington always says yes. Yes to aid. Yes to weapons. Yes to bases. Yes to commitments. Yes to treaties. Yes to alliances.\n\nIt's not enough to start saying no. The U.S. should start pruning its dependents. After all, Facebook users routinely \"unfriend\" people with whom they've had a falling out. Washington should start dropping faux allies. Doing so is far more likely to increase American security than extending new commitments and guarantees to additional weak and unimportant states.", "Local and international rights groups quick to condemn \"politically orchestrated\" trial\n\nAl-Jazeera news channel's Australian journalist Peter Greste (R) and Egyptian-Canadian Mohamed Fadel Fahmy (L) listen to the verdict inside the defendants cage during his trial for allegedly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood on June 23, 2014 at the police institute near Cairo's Tora prison.\n\n(AFP PHOTO / KHALED DESOUKI)\n\nLocal and international rights groups were quick to condemn Monday's \"politically orchestrated\" Al-Jazeera trial, calling the verdict \"disturbing sign for the future of the Egyptian press\" and demanding the immediate release of the sentenced defendants.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) released a statement Monday noting that prosecution in the case \"failed to present any credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing,\" and instead chose to use the case as \"the latest step in Egypt's unrelenting assault on free expression\".\n\n\"Sentencing three professional journalists to years in prison on the basis of zero evidence of wrongdoing shows how Egypt's judges have been caught up in the anti-Muslim Brotherhood hysteria fostered by President Al-Sisi,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at HRW.\n\nThe HRW statement called the trial a \"miscarriage of justice based on zero evidence\".\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, as well as the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, condemned both the trial and the apparent politicising of the judiciary.\n\n\"Harassment, detention and prosecution of national and international journalists, including bloggers, as well as violent attacks by unidentified assailants, have become commonplace,\" Pillay said.\n\n\"It is not a crime to criticise the authorities, or to interview people who hold unpopular views. Journalists and civil society members should not be arrested, prosecuted, beaten up or sacked for reporting on sensitive issues. They should not be shot for trying to report or film things we, the public, have a right to know are happening,\" Pillay said, adding that \"[Media employees] should be protected not persecuted\".\n\nA statement released by the spokesman for the UN Secretary General said: \"[Ban Ki-moon] is deeply concerned by recent court decisions in Egypt, particularly the confirmation of death sentences for 183 people and the sentencing of journalists, including from Al Jazeera today, to lengthy jail terms.\"\n\n\"Proceedings that clearly appear not to meet basic fair trial standards, particularly those resulting in the imposition of the death penalty, are likely to undermine prospects for long-term stability,\" the statement added.\n\nBoth Pillay and Ban Ki-moon mentioned \"that participation in peaceful protests or criticism of the government should not be grounds for detention or prosecution\".\n\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) offered some of the harshest criticism, noting that the trial was a \"a sign of the Egyptian regime's increasingly totalitarian nature,\" and calling the verdict \"politically orchestrated\".\n\n\"Not content with criminalising all political opposition, the Egyptian authorities are pursuing a policy of gagging news media that try to offer a different take on reality from the government's,\" Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Christophe Deloire said. \"We point out that such arrests and arbitrary convictions violate the provisions of the new constitution, especially Article 71.\"\n\nArticle 71 states: \"It is prohibited to censor, confiscate, suspend or shut down Egyptian newspapers and media outlets in any way... No freedom restricting penalty shall be imposed for publication or publicity crimes.\"\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists also released a statement in opposition to the verdicts: \"These convictions are shocking, and an extremely disturbing sign for the future of the Egyptian press,\" said Sherif Mansour, CPJ'S Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator. \"Authorities must release the journalists immediately and overturn the verdict on appeal.\" The statement noted that 14 journalists are currently behind bars in Egypt, while 65 have been detained since Mohamed Morsi's 3 July ouster.\n\nAlso critical of the ruling, the PEN American Center stated: \"The conviction, drawing on a trial devoid of any credible evidence against the accused, demonstrates a blatant disregard for the universally guaranteed right to free expression.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, nine Egyptian rights groups released a joint statement condemning the court's seeming disavowal of Article 71 of the Constitution as well as international human rights obligations, \"in particular Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which banned the restriction of freedom of expression\".\n\n\"All [the defendants] have done is practice the profession of journalism,\" the statement said, \"which is protected in the Egyptian Constitution\".\n\nThe statement concludes by urging the Supreme Judicial Council to address the \"anarchic\" court rulings issued recently, referencing a death sentence given to 183 alleged members of the Muslim Brotherhood last week.\n\nAmong the local signatories are the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, and the Nadeem Centre for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture.", "Where Bush has a more serious problem is in foreign policy and national security. Some of the reasons for that are more obvious than others. The most glaring, of course, is the fact that he's George W. Bush's brother. Despite what people say, W never lost the base of the party -- that 28% approval rating he had at the end were the bitter-enders who loved him for his big swinging swagger. But he was unpopular with the very people the Big Money Boyz are banking on getting behind Jeb: independents and moderate Republicans. Aside from the obvious fact that Jeb doesn't want to run against his own brother's policies, he will have a big problem with the base if he strays too far from the right's blood-thirsty foreign policy orthodoxy. But if he tacks too close a whole lot of normal Americans will instinctively recoil.\n\nLuckily for Jeb, W isn't the only Bush he can emulate. There's his Dad, another \"wartime\" president whose war was substantially more popular and widely assumed to be successful even among Democrats and independents. Yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported that in the Dialing for Donor Dollars primary Jeb is signaling that he's going to follow in his daddy's footsteps rather than W's:\n\nJeb Bush seemed to grapple with what course he should take on foreign policy last week at the Detroit Economic Club. He responded to a question about terrorist threats by linking the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. \"We have to be engaged, and that doesn't necessarily mean boots on the ground in every occurrence,\" he said. Resisting a label for his outlook, he added: \"I don't know what that makes me -- everyone has to have a type.\"\n\nI'd say that line needs some work. No Republican can afford to seem ambivalent or unsure of what he believes about America's place as the world's only superpower. The article goes on the say that Jeb has whispered that he admires the old school realists of his father's time, people like James \"f*ck the Jews, they don't vote for us\" Baker and Brent Scowcroft. And he's apparently considering hiring a former GOP White House foreign policy staffer named Meghan O'Sullivan who is more closely aligned with Bush Senior's thinking than her boss George W. Bush. This is intended to signal that he isn't going to be invading any countries on false pretenses. But then George W. Bush did the same thing when he hired Condi Rice, his father's former staffer. She was intended to be a sign that he would be following what he proclaimed as a \"humble\" foreign policy (Hey, it worked once. Well, with the help of Jeb, the Governor of Florida where W \"won\" with 537 votes. But that's a different story.)\n\nBush Senior's worldview was undoubtedly sincere. He had been running in the \"realist\" circles for decades and contrasted himself with the aggressively chauvinistic style of Ronald Reagan. He really believed in that New World Order coalition stuff. It's unknown what W really believed but there's every reason to suspect that he hadn't given it much thought prior to running for president and followed the lead of whomever sounded good to him. During the campaign using his Dad's example was useful, but once in office he leaned on his father's Secretary of Defense, Vice President Dick Cheney, who brought in his old pals who hadn't had as much influence on Poppy. After 9/11 they had free rein. But there's little reason to believe that W himself was motivated by ideology. He seemed to be personally motivated by a desire to avenge the terrorist attack by al Qaeda and to \"finish the job\" his father had left undone in Iraq.\n\nBut long before 9/11, long before the right declared that Islamic extremism was an existential threat to anyone, much less the United States, there was, as many will recall, a little neoconservative group called The Project for a New American Century. Poppy wasn't a member and neither was Junior. They were in the camp of the more mainstream Republican realism and New World Order coalition building -- the camp the PNAC was rejecting. These neocons had a number of other influential Republicans on board, including those future Bush administration figures, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz. I don't know if W had ever even heard of them before he became president but even if he did it's unlikely he understood the scope of their agenda. In any case he never articulated an opinion about it during the campaign.\n\nWhat was the PNAC's agenda? A lot of things, too much for one little essay. But in a nutshell, it was simply to make America's number one priority the ongoing, unilateral military domination of the world. The specific ideology goes back to the 1970s and had many explicit plans for Europe, Russia and Asia. But in the 1990s there was tremendous pressure building on the right to remove Saddam Hussein from power and neutralize Iran due to the threat of nuclear development and the hazard that posed to Israel. (Terrorism wasn't of any specific concern, they were hung up on rogue states, aka the \"Axis of Evil\", led by totalitarian leaders and pretty much missed the rise of Al Qaeda all together.) They spent their time nurturing Iraqi expat conman Ahmad Chalabi and working the levers of the DC social circuit to move the political dial their way, awaiting their turn at executive power. One of the most telling passages of their year 2000 manifesto called \"Rebuilding American Defenses\" was this:\n\n\"The process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event--like a new Pearl Harbor\"\n\nThey sure got one. The catastrophe of 9/11 was the catalyzing event they needed to boldly defy George Bush Senior's wussyfied New World Order and assert America's unilateral military domination. They didn't hesitate to act. We all know the result.\n\nAnd what does all this have to do with Jeb? Well, he happens to be the only Bush who was a card-carrying member of the PNAC. He was a neocon long before neocons were cool. In fact, one must suspect that his early defiance of his father and brother in this regard signals the act of a True Believer. He didn't need to do it. He was Governor of Florida, not head of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He must have really thought the cause was righteous.\n\nNow he's in the terrible position of having to distance himself from the reckless foreign policy mistakes of his brother -- mistakes that were initiated by the neoconservative claque of which he is a charter member. He's forced to pretend that he's actually an adherent of his father's foreign policy school when in fact he was among those who rejected it with disdain back in the 1990s, an act which led to his brother's fateful decision to invade Iraq without good cause.\n\nTrying to manage these various pulls of family loyalty and defiance with all these warring ideological constituencies would be a challenge to the most skilled politician who has been sharpening his game for years in anticipation of a presidential run. That politician is not Jeb Bush. Right now he's being given a smooth ride because the press and the political establishment is afraid that the lunatic fringe might get a crack at the white house and they see Jeb as the only sane alternative. The problem is that Jeb's one of the crazies too, always has been.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if you liked Dick Cheney, you're going to love President Jeb Bush. It turns out that Jeb's the guy W was pretending to be.", "China plans to create an international tourist area in its north-eastern border areas with Russia and North Korea, according to Chaina's Xinhua state news agency.

The distinguished Professor of political science and Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is once again in the dock. Indeed, the first salvo against Jega in the court of public opinion is that he is biased. Those who say that Jega is biased cite his now aborted plot to create 30,000 polling booths, eighty per cent of which would have been located in the North as evidence of his ploy to give his side of the country an edge over the rest of the country. Another charge against Jega is to the effect that the umpire has kowtowed to pressure from the opposition party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), to disenfranchise voters who are seen to be sympathetic to President Goodluck Jonathan and his ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The story making the rounds in Lagos is that INEC, in solidarity with APC, has denied the Igbo who constitute more than 46 per cent of the population in Lagos the Permanent Voter Card (PVC).\n\nAccording to fillers from the nation's commercial headquarters, INEC has asked Lagosians to go get their PVCs from the 20 local government areas and the 37 local council development areas created by its immediate past governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu who is currently the national leader of the APC. According to The Guardian of Thursday February 5, 2013, \"There are sordid tales of woe from many Lagos residents and environs, four days after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to Sunday February 8, 2015 as they troop out to their various registration centers to collect their PVCs without success. For those residents, the collection of their cards, a prerequisite for casting their votes in the February 14 general elections has either been deliberately made difficult by some individuals for selfish reasons or a deliberate plot to smear INEC's image and efforts towards superintending a successful election.\"\n\nIn the usually conservative orientations of the paper, The Guardian's report was very correct but not very elaborate enough to give its readers the benefit of forming their opinions on this very topical issue at the apogee of our national discourse. A more detailed report would have included the fact that almost one hundred per cent of those facing the logic of being disenfranchised in Lagos much against the tenets of the Electoral Act are Nigerians of South East and South South origin, an aspect of political persecution. How the PVCs got o the hands of APC political jobbers must be investigated right away. It is benumbing that INEC stooped so low as to hand over the distribution of PVCs to politicians who ask the electorate to thumb print before they are given the voter cards in Lagos. The reader should read about the plight of prospective registered voters from the South east and South south who are resident in Lagos in the February 8 edition of The Niche On Sunday. More alarming is the fact that without adequate preparation, INEC told the world that it was ready for the elections.\n\nHow ready are you for elections when more than 20 million prospective registered voters are yet to get their voter cards? How prepared are you when even your 700,000 ad hoc staff are yet to be trained and the training manuals yet to be released? Why try to blackmail Jonathan and the military with the half-truth that you are postponing the elections because of insecurity in the North-east when it is obvious that you failed to do your work well? Why the hoopla over shift in election date when it is certain that INEC is not ready for the exercise? The Electoral Act states clearly that elections could be held at least not less than 30 days to the hand over date. What this means is that INEC has the mandate to shift any election to a date not exceeding April 26. Apart from politicizing the PVCs distribution in Lagos, Kaduna and Kano, the initial refusal of the Prof. Attahiru Jega- led electoral body to shift forward the date of the elections in spite of its obvious shortcomings was the height of impunity. In a more serious and fundamental sense, Jega must explain to Nigerians why and how the distribution of the PVCs suddenly become the sole responsibility of the APC.\n\nI refuse to see this as a manifestation of the much-talked-about elite conspiracy against Dr. Goodluck Jonathan. Iam inclined to say here that my joy springs from the fact that Nigerians have now come to the realization that democracy is better than dictatorship. The President's Spartan outing in his campaign rallies across the country to confirm his transformational strides and his overwhelming endorsement by various interest groups across the country is a huge testimony to the fact that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is once again coasting to victory in the Presidential and National Assembly elections. The rallies depicted Jonathan's persona, his exuding energy, dogged political savvy, unprecedented achievements in all sectors of the economy and commitment to the Nigerian project. What some of us are saying is that we have come to the stage in our political development that every Nigerian must adhere to the tenets of democracy. No matter your commitment, real or imagined, to the fight against corruption, no matter your plan to curb insurgency in the land, if you don't adhere to the principles of the rule of law you will end up promoting more corruption and insecurity in the country. What we must first address in our country is the culture of impunity, which has degenerated to a rhythm of lawlessness. It is a season of high-profile inanities!\n\nThis culture of impunity is alien to the African setting. It is an authoritarian and totalitarian culture, which was instituted by the military in our country. General Muhammadu Buhari, the APC presidential candidate and his supporters who are apologetic to this culture of impunity, are still threatening fire and brimstone if there is any further postponement of the elections. They are trying to criminalize the Federal Government and the Nigerian military for what are clearly the obvious shortcomings of INEC. Are the military and government to blame for the failure of INEC to distribute the 23 million PVCs to registered voters? Are they to blame for the failure of INEC to produce enough training materials for the elections? Are they to blame for INEC's inability to conduct training and simulation exercises for the over 700,000 ad hoc staff on the Card Readers and other necessary aspects of the election and deploy enough Card Readers to the states? Are the military and government to blame for INEC's inability to deploy new and functional printing machines to the 36 states and the FCT to print voters' register or revisit the PVCs contracts where the contractor for the software production is holding three others to ransom? Do we expect INEC to sweep all these facts under the carpet, go ahead to conduct elections and in the end cook up figures as authentic results? What constitutes free, fair and credible elections? INEC should apologize to Nigerians and save us from hysteria in this season of high-profile inanities.", "Facebook Twitter 141 Shares\n\nWatch the 'Bounce by the Ounce' crew absolutely having it\n\nA new promo video for a Preston nightclub is going viral - and it will restore your faith in real, honest fun.\n\nThe four minute clip, shot at \"Rumes\" nightclub in Lancashire, features a bunch of rowdy ravers having it large to the sound of UK bounce.\n\nBut it's not a bunch of nine-year-olds watching Man United on Tizer - it's the \"Bounce by the Ounce\" crew, the dedicated revellers of the hottest rave night in the North West.\n\nIt's going off\n\nThe no nonsense video, which features a sweaty crowd of all ages bouncing to \"Surrender\" by Rachel Kerr, manages to capture exactly how we all wish we felt when we go on a night out.\n\nSince being published last week, the video's racked up nearly half a million views on Youtube, and is a far cry from the posey nightclub culture of today.\n\nThroughout the video, gun-pointing men and women tirelessly bop around the half empty club, in what is one of the finest examples of not giving a shit ever recorded.\n\nAt one point, a punter in a fluorescent wig takes to the floor for a free style break dance. And at 1.40 a gurny guy in blue lets himself go like no other has before.\n\nAs the night progresses there's even more neon wand-waving and whistle blowing.

While Edvard Bene\u0161 had basically been the handpicked successor to the country's founding father, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, and had stood side by side with him for the first two decades of the republic, the post-Masaryk years were a tragedy as Bene\u0161, who was always more influential as a de facto than a de jure president, abdicated not once but twice in the face of a challenge to his power.\n\nAfter the communists came to power in 1948, the regime's one-party control and a refusal to listen to criticism bore a striking similarity to the six years of tyranny the country had suffered during World War II; yet, many in the country continued to support the odious representatives of the hard-line communist government.\n\nCommunism, born out of the far-left of the political spectrum, and Nazism, located somewhere in the far-right, are not often mentioned in the same breath. Moreover, it is curious to compare the country's quick expulsion (or execution) of Germans and Nazi sympathizers from the country in the wake of World War II with the post-Velvet Revolution society, where former communists have held and continue to hold high office and peddle their influence without shame.\n\nSome of the key figures in the communist coup of 1948 were Interior Minister V\u00e1clav Nosek, who sought to do away with those in the National Police Force who were not amenable to the communist ideology; Prime Minister and Communist Party leader Klement Gottwald; and the Soviet Union's post-World War II ambassador to Czechoslovakia and then deputy foreign minister, Valerian Zorin, who encouraged the staging of a coup to seize power.\n\nIt is remarkable to see how quickly events unfolded. As the Communist Party was losing support by the end of 1947, and they realized they would suffer serious, though not devastating, losses in the May 1948 elections, they decided to go the extra-parliamentary route by pretending their support was much greater than it actually was. Actions included making their supporters more visible through regular visits to parliament to express their alleged disagreement with the way the democratic system was functioning, and the Soviet Union's troops were stationed just outside the borders, readying an invasion that would come 21 years later.\n\nIn the short video by British Path\u00e9, shown above, the major players are all visible, and it is particularly notable that the report, put together shortly before the communist takeover, starts off with archive footage of Hitler's meeting with Mussolini. While it would be absurd to compare Gottwald to Hitler, the implication of totalitarian rule is creepy in its accuracy.\n\nThe inevitability of a communist coup became apparent Friday, Feb. 13, 1948, when Justice Minister Prokop Drtina learned Nosek had dismissed a number of police officials who did not belong to the Communist Party and thus placed the safety and security of the country entirely in the hands of the communists. Prime Minister Gottwald supported the move, and when most of the non-Communist ministers resigned in protest and Bene\u0161 accepted them, the country irrevocably fell to Gottwald's party. This was the beginning of winter for Czechoslovakia, which would only lift very briefly with Prague Spring in 1969, before freedom descended back into hibernation for another 20 years.", "Mumbai (AsiaNews) - In India \"the situation of freedom of expression and thought is worsening day by day. And the worst thing is that those responsible for this decline are the security forces, and academic institutions, that should protect it. The pressure from the government, which even wants to 'Hinduize' education, has become unsustainable\", denounces I Arun Ferreira, a Dalits and tribals activist to AsiaNews. The activist was prevented from presenting his book in a University of Mumbai.\n\nImprisoned for four years on false charges, from 2007 to 2011, he was repeatedly the victim of torture in prison. Released and cleared of all charges, he has written a book - [\"Colours of the Cage\", which can be found here ed] - which tells the story of a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment who has spent several decades in prison.\n\nThe text is a denunciation of the prison and legal system, and the general climate of political intolerance of contemporary India. The story is that of a fellow prisoner, a Muslim serving a life sentence. Ferreira highlights the discrimination suffered by religious minorities, the ideological abuse and violence not only from guards, but also of the other prisoners. All themes, he tells AsiaNews, \"unwelcome to the current government.\"\n\nInvited by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai to present the book in the afternoon of 11 February, Ferreira was warned at the last minute of the cancellation of the event. The students who had contacted him explained that the police had entered the campus that morning and said that the activist \"is under investigation on suspicion of being a Maoist\" and therefore could not speak in public. Accusations, the man emphasizes, that are \"completely false.\"\n\nWhat happened, he says, \"is unfortunately not an isolated case. Directors and Deans of prestigious academic institutions throughout the country are being forced by the various wings of the State to tow a totalitarian line which crushes dissent, freedom of speech etc. Much of this is linked to the new government at the center and in Maharashtra. For this government changing the syllabii in education, sankritisation, etc are extremely important parts of their agenda. \"\n\nThe Catholic Church is in the forefront in trying to curb this trend. Catholic educational institutions are among the best in the country, and although they are a small minority Catholics manage a huge number of schools. The renowned activist John Dayal, member of the National Integration Council and former president of the All India Catholic Union, told AsiaNews that he is calling on the population to \"not to hand education over to to Hindu fundamentalists.\" (NC)", "After a decade of NATO membership, Romania is facing the first serious threats. Was the choice of the military alliance of the West a rushed or an inevitable one? NATO and the EU are both creations of the Cold War: the threat of the Soviet Union and of communism in general gave additional boost to the older project of European unity. It was also an attempt to leave behind a history charged with nationalist conflicts which had thrown the continent down a spiral of mass violence, Following the implosion of communism regime a quarter of a century ago, the former satellite-states opted into the already functional common European project. Economic prosperity, values of political democracy, higher civic freedom, principles of the welfare state, a more refined civilisation - there was a seductive prospect to countries that had been struggling with shortages, totalitarianism, de facto discrimination and ideological diktat for several decades. But political unity always comes with an inherent military size, as a project like that cannot escape threats. First of all, from the new Russia, the old, now resized enemy. Whilst, after the dismantling of the Soviet Union, it deserted communism quite easily in favour of capitalism, the country's new identity was not convergent with the European project. After a few troubled years during the Boris Yeltsin regime, Russia re-found a relative stability and prosperity, however with the price of a new autocracy but also of a renewed ideology of a Russian 'spiritual' superiority. That's an old theme upheld, among others, by Dostoyevsky - the one of a Russian messianism owing a dying Europe its salvaging. Unfortunately, such improvised messianisms are often prerequisites of imperialist thrust. To countries n the East of the continent, all these things are worrying. Next to other countries in this region, Romania has suffered a military occupation and a marionette regime because of the outcome of WWII. It therefore knows it well that, without adequate defense, any political project is vulnerable. In the period between the wars, it tried to defend itself by entering a few regional alliances, which turned out to be ineffective. NATO, however, is a totally different thing, even if Romania remains on the front line because of its border country status.\n\nLike three quarters of a century ago, many did not believe a new war was possible in such a civilised Europe. But they were wrong, as Hitler had emerged exactly as a project meant to scatter away the 'old' civilisation. Without making facile comparisons, we cannot help be concerned about Vladimir Putin's project which is so similar from this point of view. If it was just about a revengeful propaganda, it wouldn't be that dangerous, but the real threat comes from the capacity of ideological seduction. The Nazism had followers all over Europe and beyond. All the more so did communism. In fact, what the current Russian political elite regrets is the absence of an imperialist ideology as seductive as the one of communism. This is where the Russian' regime's weakness, but also explosive potential resides. It knows it cannot win on the 'spiritual' side, but does count on resentment. The 'moral order' devised by Putin's Russia cannot convince Europeans, not even those who are nostalgic about the values of the past. Equally inoperative is a claimed Orthodox 'crusade', as it would have a much too limited ideological impact. On the other hand, a cocktail of resentments could generate unexpected adhesions. The eternal fishing in troubled waters is also not to be neglected. People are speaking these days about the Achilles' heel of united Europe, which is Greece. Without forgetting the Cypriot Greeks.\n\nThe World War II had also been preceded by Germany's claim to be defending its ethnics in Czechoslovakia; exactly what Russia is now claiming to be doing in Ukraine. Back then, the sympathetic attitude of European leaders only postponed by a few months the threat of an inevitable war. It may seem incredible, but Europe is seeing again a serious threat. The Yugoslav wars were, however, contained to the seize of a regional conflict. But if Russia continues its current provocative strategy, Romania could find itself in the front line of a devastating conflict. What generally worked with the former Soviet Union was a firm policy that at times seemed to be pushing the world into nuclear war, as in 1962, with the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba. There is also another view that communism in fact collapsed because the Soviet bloc was defeated in the military confrontation thanks to the decisive breakthroughs of US technologies in the age of President Ronald Reagan, within the Strategic Defense Initiative also called the 'Star Wars'. No matter how much civilisation develops, the war will continue to be a permanent threat for human communities. It takes realism, and the Mideast shows us once more how easily war can slide into barbarism.", "In the second volume of his investigation into political institutions around the globe, Francis Fukuyama admits of troubles in the house of democracy.\n\nChina is a political force to be reckoned with.

Nearly three decades later, things look grim for his \"end of history\" thesis, though close readers of his new book will surely conclude that although his thinking has since become guarded by qualification, and by convolution, his old story of American triumph hasn't fundamentally changed.\n\nPolitical Order and Political Decay is the second volume of Fukuyama's investigation of the origins, evolution and decay of political institutions. Its lengthy argument can be summarised in a single sentence: without the prior establishment of a well-armed and functional territorial state, and without an independent judiciary responsible for overseeing the rule of law that robust state power then makes possible, modern liberal democracy cannot happen. No state, no rule of law, no democracy is the complex algorithm that structures the book, in support of his view that liberal democracy centred on free elections remains the world's No. 1 political preference.\n\nPolitical order and Political Decay by Francis Fukuyama Photo: Jason Steger\n\nFukuyama admits of specific troubles in the house of democracy, but they are seen as remediable (how they're to be fixed, he doesn't say). The bigger historical picture is different, and the future bright. His unaltered conviction is that liberal democracy has the winds of long-term evolutionary trends in its sails. Long term is important to Fukuyama, above all because the modern territorial state has become the indispensable kingpin of political order. If there is no state, there can be no rule of law, or liberal democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFukuyama's point can be read as a backdoor critique of the farcical American-led failure to build functioning states in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. It's also a sobering reminder that liberal democracy can't be built by liberal democratic means. It requires the establishment of political order through the state, followed by the imposition of legal restraints on state power. Only then can free elections take root and flourish among people living inside territorial states.\n\nFukuyama reminds his readers that liberal democracy is the offspring of the modern territorial state. The end result proved advantageous in several ways: it reduced civil wars; legalised and legitimated social divisions; enabled the growth of civil society, and facilitated the grand-scale enfranchisement of peoples for whose welfare it provided. And in international affairs, fixed state boundaries provided room for manoeuvre for any given liberal democracy.\n\nLiberal democracy in state form has certainly had downsides. In the violent business of state building, peoples who lacked the capacity to become a modern state were typically left behind, as \"stateless people\" and \"asylum seekers\"; or they became the raw material of colonisation, or victims of forcible removal and outright annihilation.\n\nThese nasty effects of liberal democracy are downplayed by Fukuyama. It is as if tawdry realities in the world of \"specific evolution\" are excused by the positively universal gains of liberal democracy at the level of \"general evolution\". Hence, Fukuyama's conclusion: even though liberal democracies such as the US do not live up to their ideals, the end-of-history thesis that liberal democracy is the only game in town remains intact.\n\nThe taxonomy of Political Order and Political Decay is grand, so splendid that at times it resembles Borges' famously fictional celestial emporium of benevolent knowledge. Fukuyama provides enlightened liberal democratic answers to every conceivable scholarly and political query. Or so it seems. Yet the grand emporium of liberal knowledge comes to resemble an untidy street market: forces extraneous to the analysis are randomly introduced in an effort to explain why things are not going as well as might be expected for liberal democracy at the \"specific evolution\" level.\n\nThe issue here is that democracy is far too complicated and contingent, its spirit and practical wanderings much too promiscuous and rebellious, to be tied down in reductionist - undemocratic - Grand Theory formulations of the kind Fukuyama uses to prop up his \"end of history\" fable. That's why, in this book, factors such as capitalist markets and public trust and national identity serve to undermine the tidy elegance of the modern state, rule of law, liberal democracy taxonomy.\n\nThe deep attachment of Fukuyama's \"end of history\" story to evolutionary metaphors is problematic in other ways. It is telling that the book contains no index entry for genocide or imperialism or totalitarianism or the atomic bomb. It's as if these sordid facts of history never happened, or no longer matter, or should not be allowed to shape our view of history. And by supposing that democracy is a third stage in a \"general evolution\" process from the founding of a sovereign state through rule of law to elections, his perspective gets important things wrong.\n\nStriking is Fukuyama's neglect of democratic innovations that either preceded or attended the formation of the modern state. Obvious examples are the election of representatives, parliaments, limited-term holding of office, petitions and trial by jury. Each of these modern democratic mechanisms has their origins in mediaeval Europe, that is, before the advent of the modern territorial state. Fukuyama is equally neglectful of more recent cases of robust democratisation that defy his liberal \"general evolution\" framework. India, Bhutan, Taiwan, South Africa, Botswana and Indonesia are democracies, but they are not liberal democracies on their way to Washington.\n\nThese are not fine-point objections. They in fact expose the ways in which Fukuyama's evolutionary liberalism blinds him to some major political developments of our times. Fukuyama's fixation on the importance of the modern territorial state leads him to ignore not just the expansion and growing anti-democratic power of bodies such as the G20 and the NSA, the IMF, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), ASEAN and the ECB.\n\nHe sees no need for rethinking the meaning and scope of democracy in these much-changed circumstances of the 21st century. The urgent double task of reinventing the democratic imagination and breathing life into democratic politics in cross-border settings such as the European Union and the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems rather lost on his thoroughly American, pass\u00e9 liberal way of seeing the world.\n\nFukuyama rightly says the Chinese state led by the Xi Jinping group is a political force to be reckoned with globally: \"China poses the most serious challenge to the idea that liberal democracy constitutes a universal evolutionary model.\"\n\nHis presumption that China ought to be on the road to Washington is mistaken. The Chinese experiment with political power is different. China is a new, 21st-century type of despotism, a flexible one-party political system whose rulers take pride in serving \"the people\" of an \"ancient civilisation\". These rulers energise markets and unequal wealth in their favour and count on support from a huge consuming middle class. They rule through law and a massive police force and army. They are guided by opinion polls, experiment with \"smart power\", internet public forums and see no need for \"bourgeois liberalism\", or for free and fair general elections.\n\nBoth the durability of this Chinese \"phantom democracy\" and the formidable regional and global power of its spreading tentacles force us to radically rethink the year 1989. Fukuyama lionised that year as the great breakthrough moment of the spirit of liberal democracy. He still sees things that way. Perhaps instead we should think of 1989 as a different new beginning: symbolised by the bloody massacre of Tiananmen, a sobering year that set important parts of the world on the road away from Washington and towards Beijing?\n\nJohn Keane is professor of politics at the University of Sydney and the author of The Life and Death of Democracy (Simon & Schuster).", "In the second volume of his investigation into political institutions around the globe, Francis Fukuyama admits of troubles in the house of democracy.\n\nChina is a political force to be reckoned with.

And by supposing that democracy is a third stage in a \"general evolution\" process from the founding of a sovereign state through rule of law to elections, his perspective gets important things wrong.\n\nStriking is Fukuyama's neglect of democratic innovations that either preceded or attended the formation of the modern state. Obvious examples are the election of representatives, parliaments, limited-term holding of office, petitions and trial by jury. Each of these modern democratic mechanisms has their origins in mediaeval Europe, that is, before the advent of the modern territorial state. Fukuyama is equally neglectful of more recent cases of robust democratisation that defy his liberal \"general evolution\" framework. India, Bhutan, Taiwan, South Africa, Botswana and Indonesia are democracies, but they are not liberal democracies on their way to Washington.\n\nThese are not fine-point objections. They in fact expose the ways in which Fukuyama's evolutionary liberalism blinds him to some major political developments of our times. Fukuyama's fixation on the importance of the modern territorial state leads him to ignore not just the expansion and growing anti-democratic power of bodies such as the G20 and the NSA, the IMF, the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), ASEAN and the ECB.\n\nHe sees no need for rethinking the meaning and scope of democracy in these much-changed circumstances of the 21st century. The urgent double task of reinventing the democratic imagination and breathing life into democratic politics in cross-border settings such as the European Union and the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems rather lost on his thoroughly American, pass\u00e9 liberal way of seeing the world.\n\nFukuyama rightly says the Chinese state led by the Xi Jinping group is a political force to be reckoned with globally: \"China poses the most serious challenge to the idea that liberal democracy constitutes a universal evolutionary model.\"\n\nHis presumption that China ought to be on the road to Washington is mistaken. The Chinese experiment with political power is different. China is a new, 21st-century type of despotism, a flexible one-party political system whose rulers take pride in serving \"the people\" of an \"ancient civilisation\". These rulers energise markets and unequal wealth in their favour and count on support from a huge consuming middle class. They rule through law and a massive police force and army. They are guided by opinion polls, experiment with \"smart power\", internet public forums and see no need for \"bourgeois liberalism\", or for free and fair general elections.\n\nBoth the durability of this Chinese \"phantom democracy\" and the formidable regional and global power of its spreading tentacles force us to radically rethink the year 1989. Fukuyama lionised that year as the great breakthrough moment of the spirit of liberal democracy. He still sees things that way. Perhaps instead we should think of 1989 as a different new beginning: symbolised by the bloody massacre of Tiananmen, a sobering year that set important parts of the world on the road away from Washington and towards Beijing?\n\nJohn Keane is professor of politics at the University of Sydney and the author of The Life and Death of Democracy (Simon & Schuster).", "\" En 1879 , Richard von Krafft - Ebing ( 1840-1902 ) , l ' auteur du fameux \" Psychopathia Sexualis \" en 1886 , isole les formes hallucinatoires ( parano\u00efa hallucinatoria ) des autres d\u00e9lires ( parano\u00efa combinatoria ) .

Techno-industrial market dramatically company is the same paranoia. The integrated spectacular society is a machine for manufacturing of paranoia. Thus fools now claim that if one is censored, it's that one with nothing to say. But it is true, that nothing should surprise us more. The same morons and cretins (I do not write for you, go your way), consider probably that it must be \"paranoid\" to describe our techno-industrial market spectacular society, surveillance society, where as d 'no /' s no the have said, surveillance monitors it - yourself. The worst is yet to come, even if we are already in the center.\n\nThe unit does is nowhere, or it would be enough that a small group is actually welded to that it becomes a formidable political force and feared by the tyranny in place. Let's share of unemployed workers in struggle, and we find that though few / many, those - and those below - this, despite arriving to unlock sensitive issues during their occupations of National Agency for Employment transformed by the liberal fascist Newspeak employment pole ... No tyranny fears disunity. It even maintains disunity even more that it knows the existing and necessary for the exercise of his tyranny. And tyranny does not know that his enemies / enemy is themselves and they - same enemy / enemy irreconcilable. For how can one think for a second, that a militant Stalinist or leftist militant, that a Social Democratic activist or an anarchist militant, s can hear? and that is indeed the whole issue well hidden by the language of militant wood. Activism is not only the highest stage of alienation, but it is also the sworn enemy and declared of revolutionary theory.\n\n\"The revolutionary organization may not be the unitary critique of society, that is to say a critique that comes to terms with No a separate power at any point of the world, and a critique pronounced globally against all aspects of alienated social life. \"\n\nGuy Ernest Debord (Society of the Spectacle, 1967)\n\nAnd this is so, this whole set of enemy / enemies who are the best allies of tyranny. Besides all the men and women, which does have no other aspiration than to take the place of tyranny in place, to substitute their replacement tyranny. So most of the \"enemy / enemy\" of tyranny, are often the structuring food for that tyranny. But under Nazism, one could treat those who denounced the totalitarian system as mentally ill suffering from delusions of persecution. Thus, if we could put comments after reading a book, or after reading an article in a newspaper, there are more comments than remaining as glowing as defamatory and nobody suddenly, n 'write more ... Unfortunately, the marketing of manipulation, which is handling the marketing, knows how to use the latest discoveries about the human brain, the better to dominate and manipulate both the individual and the masses. And there are plenty of manipulators and manipulative in militant circles of all persuasions.\n\nPeople will have to learn how the human brain in social situations, if they do not want to be manipulated or dominate. But deep down, maybe wish - they? and if people want to dominate (as does any field), that is to be loved. Because dominate and be loved, it's being loved. It is gratifying to be loved. Look dictators, leaders are often loved, it's a fact. These are the people who talk about peace, that they kill, not those who talk of war. And the worst is yet to come, although we are already in the center. Thus the words and their new clothes. This newspeak where language is revisited. The scanner is not mentioned, but Technician surface or soil engineer, even if the salary is not the same that a technician or a computer engineer. The we no longer say infirm but disabled (although a cripple may well \"live\" with his infirmity), one does say economically weak or poor but excluded one does but said janitor custodian / guardian of building.

But it is true, that the art of conversation is dead or nearly so, as had been reported at the time, the late Guy Debord (1931-1994). Now, most of our \"intellectuals / intellectual\" are breeding or battery, some / some outdoor, others on perches, but with his tongue cut out, it makes less noise.\n\nAnd we said again politicians / politicians instead of scoundrels.

Today, again, it's quickly done wrong, and they make crap for people that we take shit. The worst is yet to come, even if we do that in the middle. Politics is not a party, a trade union, organization, association. The policy that is eating, it's drinking, it's make love, it's breathing, it's thinking, it's live. Policy, that is the negation of life, which is no life of negation. And if we do not ask ourselves the right questions? difficult to provide real answers to wrong questions. The worst is yet to come because we have always responded falsely real questions, as we have always been false issues with real answers. Enjoy, enjoy good, the last rattles consumerist, renewable or not, because they are always the same, and worse, because the worst is to come.

But the unassuming facade hides something far less commonplace: two doctors flown in from North Korea.\n\nThe Chinese-owned hospital is said to be the second in the Kingdom - the other is in Siem Reap - to employ medical professionals from the pariah state, which is accused of grave human rights abuses and whose health care system is in a dire state.\n\nThe husband and wife pair of doctors were added to Lipo Long Hua's roster of mostly Cambodian and Chinese staff in September as part of an effort to appeal to the Korean-speaking community in the capital, interviews with patients, staff and diplomats reveal.\n\n\"Yes, in our hospital we also have North Korean doctors,\" a receptionist said flatly this week, handing over a business card which boasted of 24-hour service and equipment including a CT scanner.\n\nNorth Korea's vast overseas workforce - encompassing waitresses and manual labourers as well as doctors - exists to funnel money back to the cash-strapped totalitarian regime. The Pyongyang government, which seeks to develop nuclear weapons, is subject to stringent international sanctions due to its policy of denying basic freedoms and brutalising opponents in forced labour camps.\n\nAccording to a locally based diplomat not authorised to speak to the press, the Lipo Long Hua hires, as well as some in a hospital in Siem Reap that could not be independently confirmed, were arranged through representatives of North Korean recruitment firms operating with relative freedom in Cambodia.\n\nAn unlikely alliance with Pyongyang was forged by the former King Norodom Sihanouk, who counted Kim Il-sung, the iron-fisted father of communist North Korea, among his closest confidantes. The Post revealed in October that the North Korean Embassy in Phnom Penh was leased rent-free by Sihanouk in 1991 for a period of 20 years. The agreement expired in 2011, but the Koreans stayed put.\n\nAlthough the government has in recent years cosied up to the South, a major donor to the country, the five Pyongyang-run restaurants operating in Phnom Penh are among remnants of its traditional allegiance. Two more eateries have opened in Siem Reap, where the hermit nation has also built a $10 million museum.\n\nWhen it came to light last year that North Korean workers employed to build Qatar's World Cup 2022 stadiums had all or most of their wages siphoned off by the regime, human rights organisations condemned the arrangement as \"state-sponsored slavery\".\n\nThe doctors at Lipo Long Hua receive just $200 of their $1,000 monthly paycheck, with $800 sent to Pyongyang, according to a patient who said the pair had \"smoothly revealed\" they were North Korean.\n\n\"I have no belief in North Korean doctors,\" said the patient. \"But it was a little better than the local [Cambodian] clinics.\"\n\nIn 2010, Amnesty International painted a grim picture of North Korea's medical system, reporting that patients were forced to undergo major surgery without anesthesia and that hospitals lacked sterilised needles, clean water, food and medicine. Last year, the Guardian reported that citizens self-medicated with methamphetamines.\n\n\"Currently, most hospitals suffer from severe shortages of pain killers and antibiotics, with the possible exception of hospitals catering to the elites,\" wrote Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, in an email.\n\nThe locally based diplomat said that because Cambodia has a shortage of doctors, \"they [the North Korean government] think it's a good market\".\n\nThe human rights abuses committed against overseas North Korean workers have been widely documented. The exclusively female staff of the worldwide Pyongyang restaurant chain are reportedly forbidden to leave the grounds and forced to rehearse dance routines until the early hours of the morning.\n\nBut for South Koreans, the North Korean presence in Cambodia in places like Lipo Long Hua and the Pyongyang-run restaurants presents a rare opportunity to mingle with their counterparts from the other side of the border. One regular at the North Korean eateries said he had become friendly with the waitresses.\n\n\"We are afraid of each other but, as time passes, we get closer,\" he said.", "The @Dystopianya account is tweeting an entire cliched YA dystopian novel in bite-sized chunks.\n\n\"My name is Valentine Neverwoods,\" I said, my knees shaking. \"And I'm making a very brave choice that will mean standing out for good.\" -- Dystopian YA Novel (@DystopianYA)\n\nFebruary 11, 2015\n\nNone of us remember what it was like in the Before Time.

And maybe I can fight it. -- Dystopian YA Novel (@DystopianYA)\n\nFebruary 11, 2015"]}}
